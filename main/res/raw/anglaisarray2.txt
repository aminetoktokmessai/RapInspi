They
wanna
bury
me
I'm
worried
I'm
losin'
my
mind
Look
down
the
barrel
of
my
nine
And
my
vision's
blurry
Fallin'
to
pieces,
am
I
guilty?
I
pray
to
the
Lord
But
he
ignores
me
unfortunately
'cause
I'm
guilty
Show
me
a
miracle,
I'm
hopeless
I'm
chokin'
off
Marijuana
smoke
With
every
toke
it's
like
I'm
losin'
focus
Fallin'
to
sleep
while
I'm
at
service,
when
will
I
die?
Forever
paranoid
and
nervous
because
I'm
high
Don't
mention
funerals
I'm
stressin',
and
goin'
nutty
And
reminiscin'
bout
them
niggas
that
murdered
my
buddy
I
wonder
when
will
I
be
happy,
ain't
nothin'
funny
Flashbacks
of
bustin
caps,
anything
for
money
Where
am
I
goin'
I
discovered
can't
nothin'
save
me
My
next
door
neighbor's
havin'
convo
with
undercovers
Put
a
surprise
in
the
mailbox,
hope
she
get
it
Happy

Will

Or
will
they
kill
me
while
I'm
sleepin',
two
to
the
head
While
I'm
in
bed,
leakin'
blood
on
my
satin
sheets
Is
there
a
heaven
for
a
baller?
Gettin'
suspicious
of
this
bitch
the
line's
busy
everytime
I
call
her
Now
she's
tellin'

I
check
the
house
before
I

After
I

highway,

To
all
the
players
watch
the

a
nigga

The

tellin'
all
her
homies
That
I
can
fuck
her
like
no
other
now
them
other
bitches
wanna
bone
me
I'm
under
pressure
gettin'
drunk,
somebody
help
me
I
drink
a
fifth
of
Hennessy,
I
don't
think
it's
healthy
I
see
my
enemies
they
creepin',
don't
make
me
blast
I
watch
the
five-oh's
roll,
the
motherfuckers
pass
Everybody's

They

bury
me,
I'm
worried,
no
need
to
lie
I
pray
to
God
I
don't
scream
when
it's
time
to
fry
Nowhere
to
rest
I'm
losin'
homies,
ain't
that
a
bitch
When
I
was
rich
I
had
clout,
now
a
nigga's
lonely
I
put
the
pistol
to
my
head,
and
say
a
prayer
I
see
visions
of
me
dead,
Lord
are
you
there?
Then
tell
me
am
I
lost
'cause
I'm
lonely?
I
thought
I
had
friends
but
in
the
end
a
nigga
dies
lonely
Nowhere
to
run
I'm
in
terror,
and
no
one
cares
A
closed
casket
at
my
funeral
and
no
one's
there
Is
there
a
future
for
a
killer?
I
change
my
ways
But
still
that
don't
promise
me
the
next
day
So
I
stay
thuggin'
with
a
passion,
forever
blastin'
I'm
bustin'
on
these
motherfuckers
in
my
madness
They
wonder
if
I'm
hellbound
Well
Hell
can't
be
worse
than
this,
'cause
I'm
in
Hell
now
Everybody's

Ayo
are
you
afraid
to
die?
Or
Do
you
wanna
live
forever?
Tell
me
which
one?
Hahahaha
I
ain't
scared
to
die
I
ain't
scared
to
die
Oh
man
(Hey)
Yeah
Hey,
haha,
what's
up
Let’s
turn
this
house
into
a
happy
home
For
all
the
homeboys
that
couldn’t
get
they
happy
home
Let’s
turn
this
house
into
a
happy
home
Long
as
one
of
us
got
it,
some
of
us
got
it
Let’s
turn
this
house
into
a
happy
home
You
know
what
that
is,
stay
down
for
me
Now
we've
been
kickin'
it
for
quite
some
time
Remained
beside
me
through
my
trials
in
this
life
of
crime
We
done
fought
so
many
times,
I
forgot
to
count
I
never
hit
you,
not
a
coward,
rather
leave
your
house
Remember
back
in
December
when
we
was
tight?
Sippin'
Alize
and
Cristal,
whylin'
every
night
-
in
my
bedroom!
Promised
that
I
commit
to
you
soon
Tongue-kissed
me
every
time
you
seen
me
step
inside
a
room
Straight
out
the
hood
We
promised
to
be
good
to
each
other,
plus
I
love
you
So
I
know
you
gon'
make
a
good
mother
Just
try
to
understand
if
I
change
in
time
It's
only
'cause
I
never
owned
anything
that's
mine
So
I'm
tryin
you
can
stay
with
my
momma
but
keep
the
drama
to
a
low
Never
call
the
police,
I
never
call
you
bitch
or
ho'
We
were
all
born
hungry
in
this
world
alone
Finally
moved
out
my
mom's
house,
and
got
a
happy
home
Turn
this
house
into
a
happy
home
Finally
moved
out
my
mom's
house,
and
got
a
happy
home
Turn
this
house
into
a
happy
home
Oh
lord,
a
happy
home
As
soon
as
I
leave
the
house
you
wanna
page
me
See
you
got
me
trapped
I'm
goin'
crazy
this
is
slavery
You
act
like
it's
outrageous,
give
me
space,
it
won’t
get
better
And
maybe
we
will
argue
and
be
through
with
all
these
sorry
letters
Soon
as
I
come
home
it's
like
I
get
third
degree
Where
you
been
and
who
you
wit',
I
get
no
room
to
breathe
It
makes
me
wanna
leave,
I'm
sick
of
these
tricks
up
your
sleeve
You're
suspicious
I
deceive,
gimme
grief
without
belief
But
to
me,
if
you
really
trust
me
then
it's
pitiful
Question
me
about
my
whereabouts,
that's
so
trivial
Let
me
live
my
life
and
you
can
live
yours
Just
be
there
to
help
me
and
support
that's
what
you're
here
for
Not
to
give
me
stress
and
add
to
pressure
Home
is
where
I
go
to
rest,
I
go
to
pass
the
test
I'm
sorry
if
I
left
you
all
alone
So
we
argue
on
the
phone
Turn
this
house
into
a
happy
home
Turn
this
house
into
a
happy
home
Finally
moved
out
my
mom's
house,
and
got
a
happy
home
Turn
this
house
into
a
happy
home
A
happy
home
Born
through
hard
times,
ghetto
child
of
mine
I
wonder
if
you
have
to
suffer
for
your
father's
crimes
To
be
honest
it's
a
hard
road
Just
keep
your
faith
in
God,
knowin'
you'll
get
scarred
though
Look
at
him
walkin'
and
talkin',
a
lil'
child
with
my
eyes
and
mouth
Father
watch
over
lil'
seeds,
help
me
guide
them
out
Had
to
change
my
whole
lifestyle,
married
my
baby's
momma
Made
her
my
wife
now,
I'm
tryin'
hard
y'all
Maybe
in
time
I'll
be
a
better
man
Watchin'
the
older
couples,
handle
it
like
veterans
Show
me
the
meanin'
of
forever
and
together
we
rise
If
it
would
help
our
child
grow,
then
together
we'd
die
Why
-
question
my
love,
it's
so
easy
to
see
Without
my
family
all
I'm
left
with
is
a
shadow
of
me
After
all
the
arguments,
and
the
nights
alone
Now
it's
time
to
live
the
good
life,
inside
a
happy
home
Turn
this
house
into
a
happy
home
Now
it's
time
to
live
the
good
life,
inside
a
happy
home
Turn
this
house
into
a
happy
home
A
happy
home
Take
a
ride
to
my
block
(my
block)..
That's
right..
Rest
in
peace
to
all
the
motherfuckers
that
past
away
Makaveli
in
this..
Thats
how
you
do
that
shit..
They
got
a
nigga
Shedding
tears,
reminiscing
on
my
past
fears
Cause
shit
was
hectic
for
me
last
year
It
appears
that
I've
been
marked
for
death,
my
heartless
breath
The
underlying
cause
of
my
arrest,
my
life
is
stressed
And
no
rest
forever
weary,
my
eyes
stay
teary
For
all
the
brothers
that
are
buried
in
the
cemetery
Shit
is
scary,
how
black
on
black
crime
legendary
But
at
times
unnecessary,
I'm
getting
worried
Teardrops
and
closed
caskets,
the
three
strikes
law
is
drastic
And
certain
death
for
us
ghetto
bastards
What
can
we
do
when
we're
arrested,
but
open
fire
Life
in
the
pen
ain't
for
me,
cause
I'd
rather
die
But
don't
cry
through
your
despair
I
wonder
if
the
Lord
still
cares,
for
us
niggas
on
welfare
And
who
cares
if
we
survive
The
only
time
they
notice
a
nigga
is
when
he's
clutching
on
a
4.5
They
tell
us
that
we
hopeless
and
hell
bound
This
for
the
brothers
in
penetentiaries
jailed
down
Homies
in
every
city
definition
of
power
Its
a
thugs
wrath.
Can
you
feel
me
now?
Now
shit's
constantly
hot,
on
my
block,
it
never
fails
to
be
gunshots
Can't
explain
a
mother's
pain,
when
her
son
drops
Black
males
living
Hell
when
will
we
prevail
Fearing
jail
but
crack
sales
got
me
living
well
And
the
system's
suicidal
with
this
Thug's
Life
Staying
strapped
forever
trapped
in
this
drug
life
God
help
me,
cause
I'm
starving,
can't
get
a
job
So
I
resort
to
violent
robberies,
my
life
is
hard
Can't
sleep
cause
all
the
dirt
make
my
heart
hurt
Put
in
work
and
shed
tears
for
my
dead
peers
Mislead
from
childhood
where
I
went
astray
Till
this
day
I
still
pray
for
a
better
way
Can't
help
but
feel
hopeless
and
heartbroke
From
the
start
I
felt
the
racism
cause
I'm
dark
Couldn't
quit
the
bullshit
make
me
represent
Hit
the
bar
and
played
the
star,
everywhere
I
went
They
tell
us
that
we
hopeless
and
hell
bound
This
fo
the
brothers
in
penetentiaries
jailed
down
Homies
in
every
city
definition
of
power
Its
a
thugs
wrath.
Can
you
feel
me
now?
And
I
can't
help
but
wonder
why,
so
many
young
kids
had
to
die
Caught
strays
from
AK's
and
the
driveby
Swollen
pride
and
homicide,
don't
coincide
Brothers
cry
for
broken
lives,
mama
come
inside
Cause
our
block
is
filled
with
danger
Used
to
be
a
close
knit
community
but
now
we're
all
cold
strangers
Time
changes
us
to
stone
them
crack
pipes
All
up
and
down
the
block
exterminating
black
life
But
I
can't
blame
the
dealers
My
mama's
welfare
check
has
brought
the
next
man
chrome
wheels
Shit's
real,
I
know
ya
feel,
my
tragedy
A
single
mother
with
a
problem
child,
daddy
free
Hanging
out
picking
up
game,
sipping
cheap
liquor
Gamin
the
hoochies
hoping
I
can
get
to
sleep
with
her
It's
a
man's
world,
staying
strapped
Fantasies
of
a
nigga
living
phat,
but
held
back
They
tell
us
that
we
hopeless
and
hell
bound
This
fo
the
brothers
in
penetentiaries
jailed
down
Homies
in
every

definition
of

Its
a
thugs
wrath.
Can
you
feel
me
now?
Young
Thugs
in
this
motherfucker
Don't
break
up
the
fight,
let
'em
rumble
Don't
make
enemies
with
me
I
try
to
tell

Worried,

Let's

So
many
battlefield
scars
while
driven
in
plush
cars
This
life
as
a
rap
star
is
nothin'
without
guard
Was
born
rough
and
rugged,
addressin'
the
mass
public
My
attitude
was
"fuck

'cause
motherfuckers
love
it
To
be
a
soldier,
must
maintain
composure
at
ease
Though
life
is
complicated,
only
what
you

Uh,

To

Then
I

some
game
in
her
ear,
"Go

Equipped

From

Uh,

How

Back
in
elementary,
I
thrived
on
misery
Left
me
alone,
I
grew
up
amongst
a
dyin'
breed
Inside
my
mind
couldn't
find
a
place
to
rest
Until
I
got
that
Thug
Life
tatted
on
my
chest
Tell

you
feel
me?
I'm
not
livin'
in
the
past
You
wanna

Be

Remember
Kato,

longer
with
us,
he's
deceased
Call
on
the
sirens,
seen
him
murdered
in
the
streets
Now
he

in
peace
Is
there
a
heaven
for
a
G?
Remember
me
So
many
homies
in
the
cemetery,
shed
so
many
tears
Lord,

Shed

To

in
this
wicked
land,
underhanded

planned
These
scams
are
plotted
over

Outlawz

We

Me,

Got

Niggas

but
that's

‘Cause

Let

Niggas

Westside

Screamin',

in
Swahili
Pistol

Release

Say

Candyman
Bet
I

A

Murder

Hearin'

Busta-ass

Picture

Ran

Tried

Mercy

Afraid

I'm
havin'
crazy

Vivid

my
enemies,

times
God
forgive
me
‘cause

Either

Heaven

Did

Or

Hell,

Ain't

take
a
fatter
track
A
lyrical
attack,
perhaps,
it
was
a
visual
bluff
When
I
started
to
snaps
all
your
rode
'em
swoll
Straight
in
control,
flows'll
fold,
while
hoes
cold
stroll
Hold
the
set,
I
told
Dramacy'
go
in
next
Gold
diggin',
cold
diggin'
a
gold
Rolex
I
slide
in
easily,
try
a
grizzly
Sluts
know
the
cut,
I
came
to
fuck,
try
skeezin'
me
Runnin'
up
in
ya
just
like
Bruce
Jenner
when
I
bend
ya
At
the
most,
I
fucked
a
bitch
from
the
West
Coast
to
West
Virginia
Uh,
uh
It's
like
that
And,
and
It's
all
about
you
This
some
more
new
shit
Uh,
I
swear
I'll
never
call
you
bitch
again
Believe
that
This
that
new
shit
I
wrote
for
the
true
sisters
They
said
I
kept
saying
"bitch"
too
much
So
I
got
this
new
shit
for
y’all
I
swear
I
never
call
you
bitch
again
They
gave
my
homie
90
days
for
domestic
violence
I
try
to
picture
myself
in
this
position
but
remain
silent
I
get
to
thinkin'
'bout
this
shit
we
been
through
We
close
like
kin,
but
you
remain
my
friend
too
This
life
of
sin
done
got
the
both
of
us
in
trouble
But
you
always
stay
down
for
a
nigga,
so
that’s
why
I
love
you
Reminiscin'
needin'
tissues,
fightin'
over
childish
issues
Swear
I
can't
live
with
you;
but
without
you,
every
day
I
miss
you
When
we
roll
you
hold
my
pistol,
my
gangsta
bitch-itch,
you
Always
in
the
mood
for
love,
that's
why
I'm
sleepin'
with
you
Though
not
the
man
of
your
dreams
My
plan
and
scheme’s
to
be
rich
like
a
king
And
live
my
life
trouble
free,
I
see
Yesterday
I
called
you
names
and
played
games
on
your
mind
I
promise
that
I’ll
change
in
time
It's
a
complicated
world,
so
girl,
just
be
a
friend
I
swear
I’ll
never
call
you
bitch
again,
believe
me
Uh,
never,
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I
swear
I'll
never
call
you
bitch
again,
believe
me
I

Nigga
still
tired
so
I'm
yawnin’,

Tryin'

an
early
riser
Out
before

other
guys,
that's
the
way
to
profit
every
time
Can't
be
too
close
my
enemies,
they
see
ghosts,
they
envy
me
Plus

beefin'
with
the
East
Coast,
with
casualties
Got
stopped
in
traffic,
had
a
warrant,
so
they
gaffled
me
But
while
I'm
gone,
watch
my
business
and
my
back
for
me
My
enemies
think
they
got

Ain't

You

Cristal

It's

but

Told

me
the
papes
and
the
tape
case
How
much
money
can
a
nigga
make
in
one
place?
The
review,
ain't
shit
new
You
stupid
motherfuckers
can't
fuck
with
my
crew
I
see
all
these
niggas
tryin'
to
get
with
my
kin
folk
Get
so
many
busters
on
the
West
Coast
And
then,
to
say
the
least
I
see
a
few
trick-ass
niggas
layin'
low
on
the
East
Coast
And
the
question
is
asked:
Do
you
wanna
rap,
scrap,
or
blast?
'Cause
Dat
Nigga
Daz'll
be
the
first
one
to
hit
him
Oh
yeah,
fuck
B.G.
Knocc
Out
and
every
nigga
down
wit'
him
'Cause
I'm
a
natural
born
killer
In
a
Steeler
hat,
motherfucker,
'cause
it's
like
that
Now
what
would
you
do
If
you
could
fuck
with
me
or
my
crew?
There's
so
many
motherfuckers
that
I
can
include
Who's
quick
to
blast
motherfuckers
in
a
feud?
It
doesn't
make
a
difference
'Cause
it's
about
who's
the
quickest
On
the
draw
to
end
all
existence
For
instance,
let's
take
these
Ruthless
fools
These
Ruthless
fools
and
the
Pound
in
one
room
Assume,
it's
only
for
conversation
So
let's
conversate,
slip
a
nigga
the
.38,
then
dip
Empty
out
the
clip
Mind
on
set-trip,
'cause
niggas
talk
shit
Now
if
a
nigga
had
a
prayer
before
a
nigga
died
Would
the
nigga
be
dead
or
would
he
stay
alive?
And
if
I
was
in
your
own
shoes,
would
I
survive?
Probably
not,
you'd
probably
let
your
Glock
go
pop
Now
drop
to
your
knees
And
picture
raw
ass
gangsas
flowin'
in
the
breeze
Now
what
would
you
do
If
you
could
fuck
with
me
or
my
crew?
But
you
can't,
so
don't
even
think
about
Steppin'
in
the
motherfuckin'
house

Pumping

A

it
slowly
started
saying
(Bring
your
lifestyle

I'll
make
it
better)
But
how
long
will
I
live?
(Eternal

And

Pass

Hey
Daz,
the
author
of
authentics
(that's

When
I

I

Hide

I
was
laced
in

(Oh

Learned

But

Empty

To

Stupid

So

We

When

Like

But

He

Then

to
put
my
nigga

"Free

But

So

And

Million

Nigerina
I've

But

Like

all
legal
And
get
scooped

It

G's
and
laughin'
while
passin'
through
times
And
all
these
backstabbers
be
watchin',
just
keep
it
plain
I'ma
keep
it
the
same
partner,
just
take
it
the
simple
game
I
can,
pinkle
with
rain
twinklin',
diamonds
and
things
go
blinkin'
Enough
to
hold
me
'til
I'm
old
and
wrinklin'
These
adversaries,
they
gon'
have
to
be
worryin'
'Cause
I'ma
be
illin',
fulfillin'
my
passion
'Til
I'm
buryin'
my
thug
passion
I
heard
it's
the
bomb
And
you
got
it
goin'
on
Give
me
some
of
your
thug
passion,
baby
You
got
me
drippin'
wet
From
the
way
you
make
me
sweat
Give
me
some
of
your
thug
passion,
baby,
ohh
Now
what
if
me
turn
this
Hennessy
into
a
robbery?
The
prophecy
probably
suddenly
switch
how
it
supposed
to
be
And
dirty
money
can't
be
evil
'cause
it's
fillin'
up
my
tummy
Born
in
a
position,
death
collision
was
futuristic
Twistin'
riches,
but
there's
only
one
way
to
make
more
So
I'm
standin'
on
the
corner
tryin'
to
hustle
in
the
snow
And
my
bigger
bro,
couldn't
know
But
buy
a
.44,
blastin'
at
playa
haters
wantin'
more
With
a
thug
passion
Puttin'
down,
mashin',
control
by
this
thug's
passion
Unlike
them
other
bustas
pistol
blastin',
I'm
askin'
what
happened
To
the
niggas
who
kept
it
real
like
they
claim
to?
That's
what
money
and
fame
do,
see,
they
ain't
true
Travelin'
this
road,
my
poor
soul
has
been
consolidated
With
all
this
bullshit
that
I
done
tolerated
How
I
made
it
can
be
easily
stated
It's
like
my
hardest
bring
the
grip
with
the
passion
Left
me
to
fuckin'
greatest,
load
up
and
take
shit
Make
it
to
some
high
dollar
gangsta
shit
Jack
a
stack
'til
we
got
enough
bank
to
split
Creep
with
me,
through
that
immortal
flow
(That's
right)
Thug
passion
got
you
tremblin'
like
Death
on
the
Row
(Yeah)
Make
your
move,
so
I
can
throw
your
mind
a
curve
While
I'll
be
blowin'
up
the
scene,
like
my
nigga
Mr.
Herb
Take
a
toke,
as
your
heart
goes
full
arrest
I
got
the
bomb,
so
nigga,
fuck
the
rest
You
need
a
thug
to
get
you
flowin'
and
let
that
loc
see
smoke
Feelin'
the
strokes
of
the
9
squeeze
tight
and
slow
I
heard
it's
the
bomb
And
you
got
it
goin'
on
Give
me
some
of
your
thug
passion,
baby
You
got
me
drippin'
wet
From
the
way
you
make
me
sweat
Give
me
some
of
your
thug
passion,
baby,
ohh
They
say
money
don't
make
the
man,
but
damn,
I'm
makin'
money
Observin'
you
motherfuckers
'cause
some
of
you
bitches
funny
Say
you
want
it,
but
you
bullshittin'
Lickin'
them
lips,
you
got
me
'bout
to
act
a
fool
quick
Sippin'
on
some
Alizé
and
Cristal
Meanwhile,
buy
me
a
drink
and
get
to
winkin'
at
me
She
smiles;
a
nigga's
full
of
passion,
satisfaction
is
everlastin'
"How
does
it
feel?"
What
I'm
askin'
while
I'm
rubbin'
on
that
ass
"Why
you
laughin'?"See,
I'm
diggin'
as
if
I'm
curious
Full
blown
and
furious,
baby,
get
a
grip,
when
I
be
doin'
this
It's
so
physical,
my
attraction
Driven
by
alcohol,
beware
of
my
reaction
Baby,
I'm
born
to
ball,
thugged
out
on
Death
Row
You
better
recognize
and
picture
what
I
said
so
Now
you
can
feel
it,
it's
a
potion
for
my
niggas
in
motion
Forever
blastin',

this
thug

I

And

The
blind
stares
of
a
million
pairs
of
eyes
Lookin'
hard
but
won't
realize
That
they
will
never

the
P!
You

be
goin'

Give

my
money
in
stacks
and
lace
my

with
dime
figures
Real
niggas
fingers

nickel-plated
9
triggers
Must
see
my
enemies
defeated
I
catch
'em
while

coked
up
and
weeded
Open
fire,

them
niggas
bleedin'
See

and
test
and
get
your
chest

Straight

the
West,
don't
get
blown
My
adversaries
cry
like
hoes,
open
and
shut
like
doors
Is
you
a
friend
or
foe?
Nigga,
you
ain't

They
got
me
stressed
out
on
Death
Row
I've
seen
money,
but

I've
gots

You

"Go

and
I
ain't

Bail's

hell

Visions

cops
and
sirens,
niggas
open
fire
Bunch
of
Thug
Life
niggas
on
the
rise,
until
I
die
Ask
me
why
I'm
a
boss
player
gettin'
high
And
when
I'm
rollin'
by
niggas
can't
see
me!
The
stares
of
a
million
pairs
of

And
you'll
never

You
can't
see

Been

that
these
square
motherfuckers

Sayin'

My

My

house
My

like
a
Crip
or
Blood
Nigga
what!
It
ain't
nothin'
but
a
party
when

thug
And
there
I
was,
a
young
nigga
with
heart,
ain't
had
shit

Pullin'
my
pistol
on
them
fools,
you
know
the
rules
D-R-E,
you
got
me
heated;
my

like
a
penitentiary
dick
Hittin'
bitches
where
it's
most
needed
Money

weed,
Alizé

Hennessy
To
my
thug
niggas
in
lock
down:
witness

Bail

floss-mode
The

a
boss
player,

My
enemies

Die

Niggas

They

Which

Which

Oh!!
Which

Which

You
niggas
made
a
mistake
You
should've
never

Dre
Them
thug
niggas

arrived
and
it's
judgement
day
Hey

Tell

I

I'm
full

thug
nigga,
quick

And
I

Fuck

see
how
good
a
nigga's
aim

I'm
just

If

I'm

Nigga,

these
hoes
and

Look

and
visualize
my
debut
Niggas

I
gotta
stay
true
Don't

Where

Yo,

All

Oh,

You

Right
between
your

and

Right

Visualize
what

Niggas

Death

They

We

Gotta

So

Are

You

how
it
feels
to
walk
a
mile
inside
the
shoes
Of
a
nigga
who

lose?
When
me
and
you
was
homies
No
one
informed
me
it
was
all
a
scheme
You
infiltrated
my
team
and
sold
a
nigga's
dreams
How
could
you
do
me
like
that?
I
took
ya
family

I

some
cash
in

And

the
fear
put
your
ass
in
a
place
Complicated
to
escape,
it's
a
fool's
fate
Without

you're
a
shell
of
a

I

nigga,
we

I

What

If

up
to
you,
I'd
be
dead
now
I
let
the
world
know,
nigga,
you

You

See

Type

When

Gotta

You

We

So

And

No

Heartbreakin'

luxury?
Some

jealousy
it
scares
me
So
be
prepared,
'cause
only
the
strong

life
isn't
fair
(fair)
Probably

My

My
ambitions
as
a
ridah
So
many
battlefield
scars
while
driven
in
plush
cars
This
life
as
a
rap
star
is
nothin'
without
guard
Was
born
rough
and
rugged,
addressin'
the
mass
public
My
attitude
was
"fuck
it,"
'cause
motherfuckers
love
it
To
be
a
soldier,
must
maintain
composure
at
ease
Though
life
is
complicated,
only
what
you
make
it
to
be
Uh,
and
my
ambitions
as
a
ridah
To
catch
her
while
she
hot
and
horny,
go
up
inside
her
Then
I
spit
some
game
in
her
ear,
"Go
to
the
telly,
ho!"
Equipped
with
money
in
a
Benz
'cause,

bomb-ass
weed,
feelin'
Crucial
From
player
to

the
game's
tight,
the
feeling's
mutual
From
hustlin'
and
prayers
to
breakin'
motherfuckers
to
pay
up
I
got
no
time
for
these
bitches,
'cause
these
hoes
try
to

I'm

No
guts,

the
game
distorted
Now
it's
on
and
it's
on
because
I
said
so
Can't
trust

For

Full

To

Just

Flossin'

Thug,

Sayin',

I'm
thinkin'…
God
bless
the
child
that
can
hold
his

Indeed,
enemies
bleed
when
I
hold
my

Let
these
words
be
the
last
to
my
unborn
seeds
Hope
to
raise
my
young
nation
in
this
world
of
greed
Currency
means
nothin'
if
you
still
ain't
free
Money
breeds
jealousy,
take
the
game
from
me
I
hope
for
better
days,
trouble
comes
naturally
Runnin'
from
authorities
'til
they
capture
me
And
my
aim
is
to
spread
mo'
smiles

tears
Utilize
lessons
learned
from
my
childhood
years
Maybe
Mama
had
it
all

Quick

with
the
same
line
You

just
a
little
smaller,
but
you
still
rolled
Got
stretched
to
Y.A.
and
hit
the
hood
swoll
'Member

On

Collect

Oh,

Muslim

No
more
dope
game
Heard

might
be
comin'
home,
just
got
bail
Wanna
go
to
the
mosque,
don't
wanna
chase

It
seems
I
lost
my
little
homie,
he's
a
changed
man
Hit
the
pen
and
now
no
sinnin'
is
the
game
plan
When
I
talk
about
money,
all
you
see
is
the
struggle
When
I
tell
you
I'm
livin'
large,
you
tell
me
it's
trouble
Congratulations
on
the

She
got
a
playa
for
life,
and
that's
no
bullshittin'
I
know
we
grew
apart,
you
probably
don't
remember
I
used
to
fiend
for
your
sister,
but
never
went
up
in
her
And
I
can
see
us
after
school,
we'd
bomb
On
the
first
motherfucker
with
the
wrong
shit
on
Now
the
whole
shit's
changed
and
we
don't
even
kick
it
Got
a
big
money
scheme
and
you
ain't
even
with
it
Knew
in
my
heart
you
was
the
same
motherfucker

Go

And

You

We
used
to
be
like
distant
cousins,
fightin',
playin'
dozens
Whole
neighborhood
buzzin',
knowin'
that
we
wasn't
Used
to
catch
us
on
the
roof
or
behind
the
stairs
I'm
gettin'
blitzed
and
I
reminisce
on
all
the
times
we
shared
Besides
bumpin'
and
grindin',
wasn't
nothin'
on
our
mind
In
time,
we'd
learned
to
live
a
life
of
crime
Rewind
us
back
to
a
time
was
much
too
young
to
know
I
caught
a
felony,
lovin'
the
way
the
guns
blow
And
even
though
we
separated,
you
said
that
you'd
wait
Don't
give
nobody
no
coochie
while
I'll
be
locked
up
state
I
kiss
my
mama
goodbye
and
wipe
the
tears
from
her
lonely
eyes
Said
I'll
return
but
I
gotta
fight,
the
fate's
arrived
Don't
shed
a
tear,
'cause
Mama,
I
ain't
happy
here
I
blew
trial,
no
more
smiles
for
a
couple
years
They
got
me
goin'
mad,
I'm
knockin'
busters
on
they
backs
In
my
cell,
thinkin',
"Hell,
I
know
one
day
I'll
be
back"
As
soon
as
I
touch
down
I
told
my
girl
I'd
be
there,
so
prepare
to
get
fucked
down
The
homies
wanna
kick
it,
but
I'm
just
laughin'
at
cha
'Cause
you's
a
down-ass
bitch
and
I
ain't
mad
at
cha
I
ain't
mad
at
cha
I
ain't
mad
at
cha
I
ain't
mad
at
cha
A
true
down-ass
bitch
and
I
ain't
mad
at
cha
Well,
guess
who's
movin'
up?
This
nigga's
ballin'
now
Bitches
be
callin'
to
get
it,
hookers
keep
fallin'
down
He
went
from
nothin'
to
lots,
ten
carats
to
rock
Went
from
a
nobody
nigga
to
the
big
man
on
the
block
He's
Mr.
Local-Celebrity,
addicted
to
movin'
ki's
Most
hated
by
enemies,
escape
in
the
luxury
See,
first
you
was
our
nigga,
but
you
made
it
so
the
choice
is
made
Now
we
gotta
slay
you
while
you
faded,
in
the
younger
days
So
full
of
pain
while
the
weapons
blaze
Gettin'
so
high
off
that
bomb,
hopin'
we
make
it
to
the
better
days
'Cause
crime
pays,
and
in
time,
you'll
find
a
rhyme'll
blaze
You'll
feel
the
fire
from
the
niggas
in
my
younger
days
So
many
changed
on
me,
so
many
tried
to
plot
That
I
keep
a
Glock
beside
my
head,
when
will
it
stop?
'Til
God

So

I'm
still
down
I
moved
up
out
of
the
ghetto,
so
I
ain't
real
now?
They
got
so
much
to
say,
but
I'm
just
laughin'

You

My

I
would
never
be

They

sittin'
wonderin',

These

'Cause

And

Niggas

The

Blow

All

Dogg
Pound
Tha
Doggfather,

You

Daz
Dillinger,

Young
Gotti

We've

uhh
2Pac
Shakur
Uhh
Fatal,
Fatal
Hussein…

Kastro,
Kadafi
We
got
a
bunch
of
niggers
here
They've
got
guns
in
their
car
They've
got
weed,
they've
got
money
They're
with
a
lot
of
black
women,
what
should
we
do,
Sarge?
Uhh,
I
repeat,
let
'em
go
I
repeat,
let
'em
go
They're
made
niggas…
let
'em
go
But,
but
Sarge,
they've
got
guns,
they've
got
weed
I
said,
let
'em
go
Alright,
you
guys
can
go,
I'm
sorry
I'm
sorry
about
the-the
mix
up,
you
guys
can
go
Little
something
for
my
godson
Elijah
And
a
little
girl
named
Corin
Some
say
the
blacker
the
berry,
the
sweeter
the
juice
I
say
the
darker
the
flesh,
then
the
deeper
the
roots
I
give
a
holla
to
my
sisters
on
welfare
2Pac
cares
if
don't
nobody
else
care
And
I
know
they
like
to
beat
you
down
a
lot
When
you
come
around
the
block,
brothers
clown
a
lot
But
please
don't
cry,
dry
your
eyes,
never
let
up
Forgive,
but
don't
forget,
girl,
keep
ya
head
up
And
when
he
tells
you
you
ain't
nothin',
don't
believe
him
And
if
he
can't
learn
to
love
you,
you
should
leave
him
‘Cause,
sister,
you
don't
need
him
And
I
ain't
tryin'
to
gas
you
up,
I
just
call
'em
how
I
see
'em
You
know
what
makes
me
unhappy?
When
brothers
make
babies
And
leave
a
young
mother
to
be
a
pappy
And
since
we
all
came
from
a
woman
Got
our
name
from
a
woman
and
our
game
from
a
woman
I
wonder
why
we
take
from
our
women
Why
we
rape
our
women
—
do
we
hate
our
women?
I
think
it's
time
to
kill
for
our
women
Time
to
heal
our
women,
be
real
to
our
women
And
if
we
don't
we'll
have
a
race
of
babies
That
will
hate
the
ladies
that
make
the
babies
And
since
a
man
can't
make
one
He
has
no
right
to
tell
a
woman
when
and
where
to
create
one
So
will
the
real
men
get
up?
I
know
you're
fed
up,
ladies,
but
keep
ya
head
up
Keep
ya
head
up,
ooh,
child
Things
are
gonna
get
easier
Keep
ya
head
up,
ooh,
child
Things'll
get
brighter
Keep
ya
head
up,
ooh,
child
Things
are
gonna

Keep
ya
head

ooh,
child
Things'll

Ayo,
I
remember
Marvin
Gaye
used
to
sing
to
me
He
had
me
feelin'
like
black
was
the
thing
to
be
And
suddenly
the
ghetto
didn't
seem
so
tough
And
though
we
had
it
rough,
we
always
had
enough
I
huffed
and
puffed
about
my
curfew
and
broke
the
rules
Ran
with
a
local
crew
and
had
a
smoke
or
two
And
I
realize
Mama
really
paid
the
price
She
nearly
gave
her
life
to
raise
me
right
And
all
I
had
to
give
her
was
my
pipe
dream
Of
how
I'd
rock
the
mic
and
make
it
to
the
bright
screen
I'm
tryin'
to
make
a
dollar
out
of
fifteen
cents
It's
hard
to
be
legit
and
still
pay
the
rent
And
in
the
end
it
seems
I'm
headin'
for
the
pen
I
try
to
find
my
friends,
but
they're
blowin'
in
the
wind
Last
night
my
buddy
lost
his
whole
family
It's
gonna
take
the
man
in
me
to
conquer
this
insanity
It
seems
the
rain'll
never
let
up
I
try
to
keep
my
head
up
and
still
keep
from
gettin'
wet
up
You
know,
it's
funny,
when
it
rains
it
pours
They
got
money
for
wars
but
can't
feed
the
poor
Say
there
ain't
no
hope
for
the
youth
And
the
truth
is
it
ain't
no
hope
for
the
future
And
then
they
wonder
why
we
crazy
I
blame
my
mother
for
turnin'
my
brother
into
a
crack
baby
We
ain't
meant
to
survive,
‘cause
it's
a
set-up
And
even
though
you're
fed
up,
huh,
you
got
to
keep
ya
head
up
Keep
ya
head
up,
ooh,
child
Things
are
gonna
get
easier
Keep
ya
head
up,
ooh,
child
Things'll
get
brighter
Keep
ya
head
up,
ooh,
child
Things
are
gonna
get
easier
Keep
ya
head
up,
ooh,
child
Things'll
get
brighter
And
uh,
to
all
the
ladies
havin'
babies
on
they
own
I
know
it's
kinda
rough
and
you're
feelin'
all
alone
Daddy's
long
gone
and
he
left
you
by
your
lonesome
Thank
the
Lord
for
my
kids
even
if
nobody
else
want
'em
‘Cause
I
think
we
can
make
it;
in
fact,
I'm
sure
And
if
you
fall,
stand
tall
and
come
back
for
more
‘Cause
ain't
nothin'
worse
than
when
your
son
Wants
to
know
why
his
daddy
don't
love
him
no
mo'
You
can't
complain
you
was
dealt
this
Hell
of
a
hand
without
a
man,
feelin'
helpless
Because
there's
too
many
things
for
you
to
deal
with
Dyin'
inside,
but
outside
you're
lookin'
fearless
While
tears
is
rollin'
down
your
cheeks
You
steady
hopin'
things
don't
fall
down
this
week
‘Cause
if
it
did,
you
couldn't
take
it
And
don't
blame
me
—
I
was
given
this
world,
I
didn't
make
it
And
now
my
son's
gettin'
older
and
older
And
cold
from
havin'
the
world
on
his
shoulders
While
the
rich
kids
is
drivin'
Benz
I'm
still
tryin'
to
hold
on
to
survivin'
friends
And
it's
crazy,
it
seems
it'll
never
let
up
But
please,
you
got
to
keep
ya
head
up
How

dead
bodies
in
abandoned
buildings
Can't
reach
the
children,
'cause
they're
illin'
Addicted
to
killin'
and
the
appeal
from
the
cap
peelin'
Without
feelin',
but
will
they
last
or
be
blasted?
Hard-headed
bastard,
maybe
he'll
listen
in
his
casket
The
aftermath:
more
bodies
bein'
buried
I'm
losin'
my
homies
in
a
hurry,
they're
relocatin'
to
the
cemetery
Got
me
worried,
stressin',
my
vision's
blurry
The
question
is
will
I
live,
no
one
in
the
world
loves
me
I'm
headed
for
danger,
don't
trust
strangers
Put
one
in
the
chamber
whenever
I'm
feelin'
this
anger
Don't
wanna
make
excuses
'Cause
this
is
how
it
is,
what's
the
use?
Unless
we're
shootin',
no
one
notices
the
youth
It's
just
me
against
the
world,
baby
Me
against
the
world
It's
just
me
against
the
world
It's
just
me
against
the
world
Me
against
the
world
'Cause
it's
just
me
against
the
world,
baby
Me
against
the
world
I
got
nothin'
to
lose
It's
just
me
against
the
world,
baby
I
got
nothin'
to
lose
Could
somebody
help
me?
I'm
out
here
all
by
myself,
see
Ladies
in
stores,
Baby
Capone's,
livin'
wealthy
Pictures
of
my
birth
on
this
Earth
is
what
I'm
dreamin'
Seein'
Daddy's
semen,
full
of
crooked
demons
Already
crazy
and
screamin',
I
guess
them
nightmares
as
a
child
Had
me
scared
but
left
me
prepared
for
a
while
Is
there
another
route
for
a
crooked
Outlaw?
Veteran,
a
villain,
a
young
thug,
who
one
day
shall
fall
Everyday
there's
mo'
death,
and
plus
I'm
dough-less
I'm
seein'
more
reasons
for
me
to
proceed
with
thievin'
Scheme
on
the
schemin'
and
leave
they
peeps
grievin'
'Cause
ain't
no
bucks
to
stack
up
My
nuts
is
backed
up,
I'm
about
to
act
up
Go
load
the
MAC
up,
now
watch
me
klacka
Tried
makin'
fat
cuts,
but
yo,
it
ain't
workin'
And
evil's
lurkin',
I
can
see
him
smirkin'
when
I
gets
to
pervin'
So
what?
Go
put
some
work
in
and
make
my
mail
Makin'
sales,
riskin'
25
with
a
L,
but
oh
well
Me
against
the
world
With
nothin'
to
lose
It's
just
me
against
the
world
It's
just
me
against
the
world,
baby
Me
against
the
world
I
got
nothin'
to
lose
It's
just
me
against
the
world
It's
just
me
against
the
world,
baby
With
nothin'
to
lose
It's
just
me
against
the
world,
baby
Me
against
the
world
Me
against
the
world
I
got
nothin'
to
lose
It's
just
me
against
the
world,
baby
With
all
this
extra
stressin'
The
question
I
wonder
is
after
death,
after
my
last
breath
When
will
I
finally
get
to
rest
through
this
oppression?
They
punish
the
people
that's
askin'
questions
And
those
that
possess
steal
from
the
ones
without
possessions
The
message
I
stress:
to
make
it
stop,
study
your
lessons
Don't
settle
for
less,
even
the
genius
asks
his
questions
Be
grateful
for
blessings
Don't
ever
change,
keep
your
essence
The
power
is
in
the
people
and
politics
we
address
Always
do
your
best,
don't
let
this
pressure
make
you
panic
And
when
you
get
stranded
And
things
don't
go
the
way
you
planned
it
Dreamin'
of
riches,
in
a
position
of
makin'
a
difference
Politicians
are
hypocrites,
they
don't
wanna
listen
If
I'm
insane,
it's
the
fame
made
a
brother
change
It
wasn't
nothin'
like
the
game;
it's
just
me
against
the
world
Me
against
the
world
Nothin'
to
lose
It's
just
me
against
the
world,
baby
Me
against
the
world
Got
me
stuck
in
the
game
It's
just
me
against
the
world
Nothin'
to
lose
It's
just
me
against
the
world,
baby
Me
against
the
world
Hahaha,
that's
right
I
know
it
seem
hard
sometimes
But,
uh,
remember
one
thing
Through
every
dark
night,
there's
a
bright
day
after
that
So
no
matter
how
hard
it
get
Stick
your
chest
out,
keep
your
head
up,
and
handle
it
Ah,
yeah!
Hahaha
(Yeah)
It's
all
about
you,
one
time
(I'ma
say
it's
all
about
you,
baby,
yeah)
Haha,
for
the
bitches
that
think
it's
all
about
you
(It's
all
about
you)
(This
Dru
Down
in
the
house
With
my
boy
'Pizznac,
you
know
what
I'm
sayin'?)
It's
all
about
you
(Yeah,
I'm
gon'
say
it's
all
about
you
But
you
know
I'm
lyin'
though,
ha!
Yeah)
You
probably
crooked
as
the
last
trick
Want
to
laugh
'bout
how
I
got
my
ass
Caught
up
with
this
bad
bitch?
Thinkin'
I
had
her,
but
she
had
me
in
the
long
run
It's
just
my
luck,
I'm
stuck
with
fuckin'
with
the
wrong
one
Wise
decisions,
based
on
lies
we
livin'
Scandalous
times,
this
game's
like
my
religion
You
could
be
rollin'
with
a
thug
Instead
you
with
this
weak
scrub,
lookin'
for
some
love
In
every
club,
I
see
you
starin'
like
you
want
it
Well,
baby,
if
you
got
it,
better
flaunt
it
Let
the
liquor
help
you
get
up
on
it
I'm
still
tipsy
from
last
night
Bumpin'
these
walls
as
I
pause,
addicted
to
the
fast
life
I
try
to
holla,
but
you
tell
me
you
taken
Sayin'
you
ain't
impressed
with
the
money
I'm
makin'
Guess
it's
true
what
they
tellin'
me
Fresh
out
of
jail,
life's
hell
for
a
black
celebrity
So
that's
the
reason
why
I
call,
and
maybe
you
with
it
Fantasies
of
us
kissin',
can
I
hit
it?
Addicted
to
the
things
you
do
But
still
true
what
I'm
sayin',
boo,
‘cause
this
is
all
about
you
Every
other
city

video
It's

No

No

me,
just
let
me
know
I'll
have
you
hollerin'
my
name
out
before
I
leave
Nobody
loves
me,
I'm
a
thug
nigga
I
only
hung
out
with
the
criminals
and
drug
dealers
I
love
niggas
‘cause
we
comin'
from
the
same
place
Witness
me
holla
at
a
hoochie,

how
quick
the
game
takes
How
can
I
tell
her
I'm
a
playa
and
I
don't
even
care?
Creep
low,
weed
smoke's
in
the
air
Everywhere
I
go,
it's
all
about
the
groupie
hoes
Waitin'
for
niggas
at
the
end
of
every
show
I
just
seen
you
in
my
friend's
video
Could
never
put
a
bitch
before
my
friends,
so

Follow

No

Is
you

from
the
dick,
or
is
it
the
flu?
It
ain't

you
or
your
bitch-ass
crew
Every
other
city

Explain

nasty
new
niggas,

You
couldn't
hold
me
back,
it'd
take
a
fatter
track
A
lyrical
attack,
perhaps,
it
was
a
visual
bluff
When
I
started
to
snaps
all
your
rode
'em
swoll
Straight
in

Hold

Runnin'

At

Don't

"Guess

"Guess

"Guess

Everywhere

Everywhere
I

Everywhere

Everywhere

Posse
deep
as
I
roll
through
the
streets
Motherfuck
the
police
as
we
creep
in
our
Jeeps
Layin'
so
low
you'd
think
I'm
asleep
But
at
the
slightest
beef
I'm
robbin'
niggas
of
they
teeth
And
OPD
can
get
the
dick
if
they
play
toughy
Last
time
them
niggas
rushed
me
I
ain't
bust,
but
now
I'm
touchy,
trust
me
Ain't
nothin'
jumpin'
but
these
buckshots
A
nigga's
got
enough
knocks,
I'm
poppin'
at
corrupt
cops
Them
motherfuckers
catch
a
hot
one
You
wanted
to
start
a
problem
Now
you
coward
cops
have
got
one
And
there's
no
prison
that
can
hold
a
Motherfuckin'
soldier,
ready
to
roll
and
take
control
So
now
I
jack
'em
while
they
sleepin'
Roll
to
the
door,
throw
a
grenade
in
the
precinct
Some

brothers
bugged
out
I
had
to
keep
poppin'
‘cause
there's
no
stoppin'
till
they
rubbed
out
And
they
vest
don't
protect
from
the
head
wounds
Reload
ammunition's
and
them
bitches
will
be
dead
soon
Smoke
risin'
from
the
barrel
of
my

I
finally
got
revenge,
now
count
the
bodies
Twenty
cops,

for
every
year
in
jail
Tryna

shit

Before

Fuck

bottle
It

G
‘Cause

I'm
not

person
I
don't
try
to

‘Cause

This

and

In

this
shit,
hell
motherfuckin'
yeah
An
ounce
of
that
shit,
sittin'
in
yo'
motherfuckin'
lap
Now
press
rewind
nigga
Uh,
hit
'em
with
a
little
ghetto
gospel
Those
who
wish
to
follow
me
(My
ghetto
gospel)
I
welcome
with
my
hands
And
the
red
sun
sinks
at
last
Into
the
hills
of
gold
And
peace
to
this
young
warrior
Without
the
sound
of
guns
If
I
could
recollect
before
my
hood
days
I
sit
and
reminisce,
thinkin'
of
bliss
and
the
good
days
I
stop
and
stare
at
the
younger
My
heart
goes
to
'em,
they
tested
with
stress
that
they
under
And
nowadays
things
change
Everyone's
ashamed
of
the
youth
'cause
the
truth
look
strange
And
for
me
it's
reversed
We
left
'em
a
world
that's
cursed,
and
it
hurts
‘Cause
any
day
they'll
push
the
button
And
all
good
men
like
Malcolm
X
or
Bobby
Hutton
died
for
nothin'
Don't
it
make
you
get
teary?
The
world
looks
dreary
When
you
wipe
your
eyes,
see
it
clearly
There's
no
need
for
you
to
fear
me
If
you
take
your
time
to
hear
me
Maybe
you
can
learn
to
cheer
me
It
ain't
about
black
or
white,
‘cause
we
human
I
hope
we
see
the
light
before
it's
ruined;
my
ghetto
gospel
Those
who
wish
to
follow
me
(Ghetto
gospel)
I
welcome
with
my
hands
And
the
red
sun
sinks
at
last
Into
the
hills
of
gold
And
peace
to
this
young
warrior
Without
the
sound
of
guns
Tell
me,
do
you
see
that
old
lady?
Ain't
it
sad?
Livin'
out
of
bag
but
she's
glad
for
the
little
things
she
has
And
over
there,
there's
a
lady,
crack
got
her
crazy
Guess
who's
givin'
birth
to
a
baby?
I
don't
trip
or
let
it
fade
me
From
out
of
the
fryin'
pan
we
jump
into
another
form
of
slavery
Even
now
I
get
discouraged
Wonder,
if
they
take
it
all
back,
will
I
still
keep
the
courage?
I
refuse
to
be
a
role
model
I
set
goals,
take
control,
drink
out
my
own
bottles
I
make
mistakes
but
learn
from
every
one
And
when
it's
said
and
done,
I
bet
this
brother
be
a
better
one
If
I
upset
you,
don't
stress
Never
forget
that
God
isn't
finished
with
me
yet
I
feel
His
hand
on
my
brain
When
I
write
rhymes
I
go
blind
and
let
the
Lord
do
his
thang
But
am
I
less
holy
'Cause
I
chose

We

Class
is
in
session:
the
worst
question
is
the
first
question
Why
do
we
work
like
slaves
sweatin'
blades
to
an
early
grave?
Never

Love's

true
–
life's
a
bitch,
true?
You
best
to
backtrack
and
try
to
act
black
and
live
Not
to
be
phony
and
positive
but
why
be
negative?
What's
the
matter,
G?
Black
cat
got
your
tongue?
Fat
track
got
you
sprung,
now
you're

Do

Dum

Attempt

If

peace,
then
at

I'm
tired

Lookin'

Reminiscin'
of

POOF!
We
used
to
have

now
there's
no

Nobody

Why

It's

it
ain't

nothin'
So
I
just
go
with
what
I
know,
I
don't
trust

Look
what
the
80's

And
now
we

If

why

Runnin'

Possessed

I

Sacrifice

Get

Cause
you

aluminum
foil

The

I'm

you
but
some

I'm

now
but
the
fact

That
the
struggle
that
I'm

Hahahaha,

See,

Life
as
a
celebrity
is
less
than
heavenly
I
got
these
fakes
and
these
backstabbers
chasing
me
around
And
it's
always
drama,
whenever
I
wanna
get
around
Momma
told
me,
long
before
I
ever
came
up
Gotta
be
true
to
what
you
do
and
keep
the
game
up
‘Cause
things
change,
and
jealousy

Best

at
your
wife's
house,
tryin'
to
mack

I'm

but
still
they
keep
on
knockin'
at
my
door
And
I
got
no
time
to
worry,
I'm
steady
wanting
more
Every
day
is
a
test,
yes,
I
try
hard
But
I'm
strugglin'
with
every
breath,
I
pray
to
God
That
the
woman
that
I
left
at
home,
all
alone
There
ain't
nothing
like
tryin'
to
bone,
over
the
phone
In
my
mind
I
can
see
her
naked,
I
can't
take
it
Got
me
shaking
at
the
thought
that
we
can
make
it
I
thought
you
knew
I'm
rollin'
out
on
tour
today
You
getting
sad,
‘cause
I'm
going

The

You

Still

I'm

I

you
up
long
distance,
on
the
telephone
Wanna
tuck
you
in
even
though
I
can't
make
it
home
I
whisper
things
in
your
ear
like
you're
near
me
Wonder
if
you
feel
me
from
far
away,
and
can
you
hear
me?
It
seems
to
me,
that
you're
jealous
‘Cause
I'm
hustling
and
making
money
with
the
fellas
In
the
backstreets,
tryin'
to
track
me,
baby,
hold
up!
Thugs
get
lonely
too,
but
I'm
a
soldier
And
there's
no
way
I'ma
stop
making
money
‘Cause
your
attitude's
changed
and
you're
acting
a
little
funny
Always
complaining,
saying
we
don't
spend
time
Can't
you
see
I
got
enough
stress
on
my
mind?
And
hanging
up
like
you
all
that
Then
get
mad
when
I
tell
you
that
I'm
busy,
baby,
call
back
Please,
ain't
nothing
left
to
say
to
you
Thugs

as
I

I
sit
alone
in
my
room,
drinking
without
a
care
Talking
out
loud
to
you,
like
you're
there
Take
your
picture
out
my
back
pocket,
man,

on
You're
the
first
face
I
wanna
see
when
I
get
home
Wanna
love
you
'til
the
sun
rise,
buckwild
Touching
every
wall
in
the
house,
thug
style
Put
your
hands
on
the
headboard,
think
of
me
Drippin'
sweat
on
top
of
you,
sink
and
see
This
in
your
head
that
I'm
making
love,
so
turn
the
lights
down
Reminisce
and
relax
‘cause,
baby,
right
now
I
feel
it
in
the
middle
of
my
stomach
You
whisper
in
my
ear
and
baby,
tell
me
how
you
really
want
it
Hold
on
tightly,
watch
the
ceiling
Scratch
my
back's
how
you
react,
let
me
know
you
feel
me
‘Cause
everything
I'm
giving
to
you,
is
so
true
And
thugs
get
lonely
too,
you
know
I'm
rollin'
out
on

today
You
getting
sad,

The

punk
police?
Niggas

peace
Fuck

Don't

My

9's

BIYA
BIYA

Korean
motherfuckers

So

Now

streets

So

Empty

Lickin

Love

Glock

coppers
So

9
last
year,

'99
I'm

And
even
if
they
pull
they
triggers
They
can
shoot

man,
but
nothing's
gonna
stop
the
plan
of
true
niggas
{"Niggas!"}
Yeah,

{"Niggas!"}
Yeah,

Cause
bein
a
nigga

you
love
niggas,
haha
{"Niggas!"}
I
was
raised
in
this
society
so
there's
no
way
you
can
Expect
me
to
be
a
perfect
person,
cause
I'mma
do
what
I'mma
do
Aiyyo!
My
dimes

the
fiends

call
'em
Bedrocks
Niggas
is
like
photographers,
all
they
take
is
headshots
Your
last
words'll
be,
damn,

all
these
red
dots?
Niggas
nowadays
they
worry
me
My
bars
is
therapy,
as
long
as
you

'em
thoroughly
Muah

that
they
bury
me
My
niggas
is
stronger
and
tighter
now
than
they
probably
ever
be
And
I'm
a
product
of
the
70's
The
hood
got
niggas
on
punishment,
that's
why
they
never
leave
If
I
ain't
eatin
wit'chu
I'm
probably
beefin
wit'chu
If
no
money
ain't
involved

no
need
for
me
speakin
wit'chu
I
know
you

a
gun
but
I'm
hopin

Cause

I'm
one
of
the
rappers
that
keep
a
pistol
And
know
what
the
llama
do
Shady/Aftermath,
Ruff
Ryders,
D
Block,
and
of
course
Amaru
Lot
of
people
honor
you,
probably
cause
the
way
That
you
used
to
bring
the
drama
to,
whoever
you
wanted
to
You
a
leader
when
you
can
get
a
leader
to
follow
you
But,
anyway,
life
goes
on
So
I'll
see
you
when
I
art
in
heaven
like
our

Ever

And

why
I'm
a
hustler,

Even

'Cause

I

I'll

by
the
hands

They

Now

A

One

And
Big

police?
Ain't

the
motherfuckers
got
a
beef
with
me
They
make
it
hard
for
me
to
sleep
I
wake
up
at
the
slightest
peep,
and
my
sheets
are
3
feet
deep
I
guess
it's
hard
for
you
to
see
But
now
I'm
pointin'
the
finger
at
police
Instead
of
them
motherfuckers
blamin'
me
I
got
the
right
to
bear
a
pistol
And
when
the
punk
motherfuckers
get
to
trippin'
I
got
shit

And

then
you'll

But

G
They

And

the
Rebel
and
the
Devil,
and

goin'
to
Hell
I

the
whole
place
covered,
with
loc'd

And

So

motion
I

throw
your
ass

the
ocean
Temperatures

it's
cool
to
shoot
a
nigga
But
they
hate
it
when
we
pop
the
cops
That's
when
they
gettin'
petrol
You
better
watch
your
step
or
you'll
be
left
on
death
row
But
I
learn
to
look
ahead
of
me
Stay
strapped
watch
your
back
keep
your
eyes
on
the
enemy
We
blowin'
up
precincts
and
OOOH
You

the
crew,
of
crooked
nigga

It's

And

And
maybe
then
you'll

OOOH!
But

It's

the
crew,
of
crooked
nigga
too
I
ain't
got
time
for
this,
man
I'm
out
You
should
stop,
for
a
while
You
will
find
me
standing
by
(don't
you
trust
me)
Over
here,
at
the
side,
of
your
life
(it's
not
that
I
don't
trust
you)
You
spend
all
your
hours
just
rushing,
around
Do
you
have
a
little
time
To
have
a
little
time
for
me?
(not
that
I
don't
trust
you)
As
soon
as
I
leave
the
house
you
wanna
page
me
See
you
got
me
trapped
I'm
goin'
crazy
this
is
slavery
You
act
like
it's
outrageous,
give
me
space,
it
won't
get
better
And
maybe
we
will
argue
and
be
through
with
all
these
sorry
letters
Soon
as
I
come
home
it's
like
I
get
third
degree
Where
you
been
and
who
you
wit',
I
get
no
room
to
breathe
It
makes
me
wanna
leave,
I'm
sick
of
these
tricks
up
your
sleeve
You're
suspicious
I
deceive,
gimme
grief
without
belief
But
to
me,
if
you
really
trust
me
then
it's
pitiful
Question
me
about
my
whereabouts,
that's
so
trivial
Let
me
live
my
life
and
you
can
live
yours
Just
be
there
to
help
me,
and
support
that's
what
you're
here
for
Not
to
give
me
stress
and
add
to
pressure
Home
is
where
I
go
to
rest,
I
go
to
pass
the
test
I'm
sorry
if
I
left
you
all
alone
But
I
couldn't
make
it
home,
so
we
argue
on
the
phone
Don't
you
trust
me?
You
should
stop,
for
a
while
You
will
find
me
standing
by
(don't
you
trust
me)
Over
here,
at
the
side,
of
your
life
(it's
not
that
I
don't
trust
you)
You
spend
all
your
hours
just
rushing,
around
Do
you
have
a
little
time
To
have
a
little
time
for
me?
(not
that
I
don't
trust
you)
Callin'
at
my
house
then
hangin'
up,
you
think
that
makes
sense?
Tell
me
what
it
takes
for
us
to
shake
so
we
can
be
friends
It's
time
for
us
to
take
our
separate
paths
We
had
a
lot
of
laughs
but
the
good's
become
the
past
Let's
make
it
an
even
break,
don't
make
it
scandalous
Try
and
be
mature,
I'm
pretty
sure
that
we
can
handle
this
You're
sayin'
I'm
too
busy,
I
ignore
you
I
guess
you
didn't
hear
me
when
I
said
that
I,
cared
for
you
But
now
it
seems
the
arguments
are
nightly
I
wanna
hold
you
tightly
but
instead,
you
wanna
fight
me
So
why
let
it
stress
and
aggravate
me?
Instead,
I'd
rather
break,
hope
you
don't
hate
me
You
tell
me
that
you
love
me
but
you're
lyin'
Fightin'
back
the
urge
to
just
start
cryin'
I'll
wipe
away
your
tears,
come
and
hug
me
I
love
you
like
you
love
ME,
girl,
but
don't
you
trust
me?
You
should
stop,
for
a
while
You
will
find
me
standing
by
(don't
you
trust
me)
Over
here,
at
the
side,
of
your
life
(it's
not
that
I
don't
trust
you)
You
spend
all
your
hours
just
rushing,
around
Do
you
have
a
little
time
To
have
a
little
time
for
me?
(not
that
I
don't
trust
you)
I
hang
up
the
phone,
I
can't
bear
to
hear
you
yellin'
at
me
Maybe
we
should
end
it,
neither
one
of
us
are
happy
You
know
that
I'm
emotional,
you
know
me
Comin
over
cryin'
just
to
get
me
feelin'
guilty
You
and
me
were
meant
to
be
and
yet
You
always
wanna
sweat,
how
much
closer
can
we
get
Don't
fret,
just
let
me
pack
my
things
and
I'll
be
outtie
This
time
I'm
breakin'
out,
you
let
your
mouth
overcrowd
me
I
can't
take
the
beefin'
and
the
griefin'
I
get
no
room
to
sleep,
I
hope
to
see
some
cause
I'm
leavin'
Maybe
next
time
you'll
be
a
little
more
sure
And
I
can
give
you
more
when
you
mature
But
baby
until
then
I
gotta
leave
ya
It's
not
that
I
don't
need
ya
but
see
ya!
And
I
hope
you
understand
why
I'm
bustin'
Not
because
we
rushed
it
Don't
you
trust
me?
You
should
stop,
for
a

You
will
find

Hey!
Why'd
you
slang
crack?

to
Why'd
you
slang
crack?
Cause
I
had
to
Why'd
you
slang
crack?
Cause
I
had
to
A
nigga
gotta
pay
the
fuckin
rent
Crazy,
I
gotta
work
with
what'chu
gave
me
You
claimin
I'm
a
criminal
and
you
the
one
that
made
me
They
got
me
trapped
in
this
slavery
Now
I'm
lost
in
this
holocaust
headin
for
my
grave
G
I
told
Sam
he
could
fuck
the
war
And
got
a
busted
jaw
for
sayin
fuck
the
law
And
if
you
wonder
why
I'm
mad
check
the
record
What's
a
nigga
gotta
do
to
get
respected?
Sometimes
I
think
I'm
gettin
tested
And
if
I
don't
say
yes
a
nigga's
quick
to
get
arrested
That's
the
reason
I
stay
testin
I
keep
a
vest
on
my
chest
in
case
the
cops
are
gettin
restless
Walkin
around,
ready
to
light
shit
up
But
since
my
life
is
fucked,
some
say
I'm
slightly
nuts
Buck
buck
is
the
sound
as
I
move
up
Other
niggas
pay
attention
when
a
fool
bust,
huh
They
make
a
nigga
be
a
killer;
I
used
to
be
a
dealer
But
they
wanted
to
see
who's
realer
Now
them
same
motherfuckers
wanna
murder
me
And
I
wonder
if
the
Lord
ever
heard
of
me,
huh
I
need
loot,
so
I'm
doin
what
I
do
And
don't
say
shit
until
you
walked
in
my
shoes
There
was
no
other
destiny
to
choose
I
had
nuttin
left
to
lose,
so
I'm
singin

blues
Why'd
you
slang
crack?
I
had

But

Instead

so
is
my
Caddy
And
I'm
steady
catchin
static,
move
the
traffic
to
the
alley
Out
in
Cali
niggas
rally
others
all
for
the
soil
Mix
the
work
with
bakin
soda
and
get
the
water
to
boil
OH
NO
can't
no
busters
hang,
I
hope
you
feel
me
mayne
Cause
snitches
bitches
and
they
ain't
been
loyal
to
the
game
My
niggas
feel
my
pain,
when
sunshine
turn
to
rain
You
know
these
buster
motherfuckers
came
to
fuck
the
game
And
it's
a
shame
I
see
the
mark
in
they
eyes
When
they
yellin
that

Loyalty,
undeservedly,
never
heard
of
me
I,
be
the
exception,
the
epitome
of
adaption
The
superficial
surroundings,
bullets
fiends
cockhounds
and
Enemies
in
my
family
extortin
schemin
and
scammin
me
(pop

I'm
like
Bruce
Nolan,
I'm
rollin'
until
the
diesel
hit
me
I'm
battered
and
bruised,
and
madder
havin
to
choose
'tween
happiness
and
the
blues,
and
who
be
fillin
my
shoes
When
I
done
had
it
with
crews,
ecstatic
to
see
me
lose
But
panic
when
I
be
smooth,
I'm
manic
but
I'm
no
fool
Y'all
rappin
I'm
talkin
cool,
and
Columbine
is
not
new
In
Compton
they
shoot
up
schools
too,
ridin
by
to
see
who's
who
Cock
the
shotty
they
cruise
through,
rock
the

blood
ooze
through
Tell
his

that
dude's

no
comin
back
From
him
scrappin
when
niggas
was
packin
and
he
wasn't
packin
too
So
if
you
feel
me
you
know
when
they
try
to
kill
me
they
slow
I
seen

Only

Back
in
elementary,
I
thrived
on
misery
Left
me
alone,
I
grew
up
amongst
a
dyin'
breed
Inside
my
mind
couldn't
find
a
place
to
rest
Until
I
got
that
Thug
Life
tatted
on
my
chest
Tell
me,
can
you
feel
me?
I'm
not
livin'
in
the
past
You
wanna
last?
See
the
first
to
blast
Remember
Kato,
no
longer
with
us,
he's
deceased
Call
on
the
sirens,
seen
him
murdered
in
the
streets
Now
he
rest
in
peace
Is
there
a
heaven
for
a
G?
Remember
me
So
many
homies
in
the
cemetery,
shed
so
many
tears
Lord,
I
suffered
through
the
years
And
shed
so
many
tears
Lord
Now
that
I'm
strugglin'
in
this
business,
by
any
means
Label
me
greedy
gettin'
green,
but
seldom
seen
And
fuck
the
world
'cause
I'm
cursed
I'm
havin'
visions
of
leavin'
here
in
a
hearse
God,
can
you
feel
me?
Take
me
away
from
all
the
pressure
and
all
the
pain
Show
me
some
happiness
again
I'm
goin'
blind,
I
spend
my
time
in
this
cell,
ain't
livin'
well
I
know
my
destiny
is
Hell,
where
did
I
fail?
My
life
is
in
denial
and
when
I
die
Baptized
in
eternal
fire,
shed
so
many
tears
Lord,
I
suffered
through
the
years
(C'mon
wit'
it)
And
shed
so
many

Lord,
I
suffered
through
the
years
And
shed
so
many
tears
Lord,
I
suffered
through
the
years
And
shed
so
many

I'm
not
gonna
even
introduce
this
next
artist
coming
'Cause
y'all

who
it
is
Give

Oh,
2Pac
is
performing

Ooh,

And

Don't

backstage,
so
it's

But
I
got
dibs
at
the
hotel
afterwards
His
body
though!
Oh,

nigga's
body.
I
just
wanna
snatch
his
clothes
off
and
just
do

"How
do
you
want
it?
Oooh,
how
do
you
feel?"
I
wanna
feel
that
shit
Them
eye
lashes,
you
know
it's
gonna
be

Well

I
won't
deny

I'm
a
straight
ridah
You
don't
wanna
fuck
with

Got
the
police
bustin'
at

But
they

So
many
battlefield
scars
while
driven
in
plush
cars
This
life
as
a
rap
star
is
nothin'
without
guard
Was
born
rough
and
rugged,
addressin'
the
mass
public
My
attitude
was
"fuck
it,"
'cause
motherfuckers
love
it
To
be
a
soldier,
must
maintain
composure
at
ease
Though
life
is
complicated,
only
what
you
make
it
to
be
Uh-huh-huh,
and
my
ambitions
as
a
ridah
To
catch
her
while
she
hot
and
horny,
go
up
inside
her
Then
I
spit
some
game
in
her
ear,
"Go
to
the
telly,
ho!"
Equipped
with
money
in
a
Benz
'cause,
bitch,
I'm
barely
broke
I'm
smokin'
bomb-ass
weed,
feelin'
crucial
From
player
to
player,
the
game's
tight,
the
feeling's
mutual
From
hustlin'
and
prayers
to
breakin'
motherfuckers
to
pay
up
I
got
no
time
for
these
bitches,
'cause

No

the
game
distorted
Now
it's

because

said
so
Can't
trust
a
bitch
in
the
business
so
I
got
with
Death
Row
Now
these
money-hungry
bitches
gettin'
suspicious
Started
plottin'
and
plannin'
on
schemes
to
come

But

(Yeah)
Me,

night
Got

These

'Cause

Dead

Need

Mercy

Afraid

Vivid

Lord,
forgive

Either

Heaven
and

I
was
a

Did

raised
in
insanity
Or
send

Hell,
‘cause
I
ain't

Ain't

And

Everybody!
You

Want

'bout
how
I
got
my
ass
Caught
up
with
this
bad
bitch?
Thinkin'
I
had
her,
but
she
had
me
in
the
long
run
It's
just
my
luck,
I'm
stuck
with
fuckin'
with
the
wrong
one
Wise
decisions,
based
on
lies
we
livin’
Scandalous
times,
this
game’s
like
my
religion
You
could
be
rollin'
with
a
thug
Instead
you
with
this
weak
scrub,
lookin’
for
some
love
In
every
club,
I
see
you
watchin'
like
you
want
it
Well,

you
got
it,
better
flaunt
it
Let
the
liquor
help
you
get
up
on
it
I'm
still
tipsy
from
last
night
Bumpin'
these
walls
as
I
pause,
addicted
to
the

life
I
try
to

Sayin’

with
the
money

Guess

true
what
they
tellin'
me
Fresh
out
of
jail,
life's
hell
for
a
black
celebrity
So

the
reason
why

it
Fantasies
of

Addicted
to

Creep

Everywhere

Waitin'

Follow
the
leader
and

the
drama
that
I'm
goin'
through
It's
all
about
you
Yeah,
nigga,
it's
all
about
you
Every
other
city
we
go,
every
other
video
It's
all
about
you
No
matter
where
I
go,
I
see
the
same
ho
Every
other
city
we

every
other
video
It's
all
about
you
No
matter
where
I
go,
I
see
the
same
ho
Is
you
sick
from
the
dick,
or
is
it
the
flu?
It
ain't
about
you
or
your
bitch-ass
crew
Every
other
city
we
go
and
every
video
Explain
to
a
nigga
why
I
see
the
same
shitty
ho?
You
think
it's
all
about
you?
Well,

I
gets
down
like
Dru,
and
my
nasty
new
niggas,
too
You
couldn't
hold
me
back,
it'd
take
a
fatter
track
A
lyrical
attack,
perhaps,
it
was
a
visual
bluff
When
I
started
to
snaps
all
your
rode
'em
swoll
Straight
in
control,
flows'll
fold,
while
hoes
cold
stroll
Hold
the
set,
I
told
Dramacy'
go
in
next
Gold
digger,
cold
diggin'
a
gold
Rolex
I
slide
in
easily,
try
a
grizzly
Sluts
know
the
cut,
I
came
to
fuck,
try
skeezin'
me
Runnin'
up
in
ya
just
like
Bruce
Jenner
when
I
bend
ya
At
the
most,
I
fucked
a
bitch
from
the
West
Coast
to
West
Virginia
Uh,
uh
It's
like
that
It's
all
about
you
Where
"How
Do
You
Want
It"
at
yo?
How
do
you
want
it?
Where
that
freaky
shit?
How
does
it
feel?
Uh,
I
swear
I
never
call
you
bitch
again
Believe
me
This
that
new
shit
I
wrote
for
the
true
sisters
They
said
I
couldn't
say
"bitch"
too
much,
so
I
got
this
new
shit
for
y'all
I
Swear
I'll
never
call
you
bitch
again
They
gave
my
homie
90
days
for
domestic
violence
I
try
to
picture
myself
in
this
position
but
remain
silent
I
get
to
thinkin'
'bout
this
shit
we
been
through
We
close
like
kin,
but
you
remain
my
friend
too
This
life
of
sin
done
got
the
both
of
us
in
trouble
But
you
always
stay
down
for
a
nigga,
so
that's
why
I
love
you
Reminiscin'
needin'
tissues,
fightin'
over
childish
issues
Swear
I
can't
live
with
you;
but
without
you,
every
day
I
miss
you
When
we
roll
you
hold
my
pistol,
my
gangsta
bitch-itch,
you
Always
in
the
mood
for
love,
that's
why
I'm
sleepin'
with
you
Though
not
the
man
of
your
dreams
My
plan
and
scheme's
to
be
rich
like
a
king
And
live
my
life
trouble
free,
I
see
Yesterday
I
called
you
names
and
played
games
on
your
mind
I
promise
that
I'll
change
in
time
It's
a
complicated
world,
so
girl,
just
be
a
friend
I
swear
I'll
never
call
you
bitch
again
Believe

Uh,

call
you
bitch

me
I

Nigga

Tryin'

Out

the
way
to
profit
every
time
Can't
get
too
close,
my
enemies,
they
see
ghosts,
they
envy
me
Plus

beefin'

the
East
Coast,
with
casualties
Got
stopped
in
traffic,
had
a
warrant,
so
they
gaffled
me
But
while
I'm
gone,
watch
my
business
and
my
back
for
me
My
enemies
think
they
got
me
crossed,
they
ain't
knowin'
Ain't

love
for
player
haters
where

Got
me
out
of
jail,
paid
bail,

you
on
your
own
again
Cristal
corks
are
popped,
romantic
thoughts
are
dropped
Don't
panic
but
no
matter,
‘cause
we
crossed
the
top
Told
you
young
lady,
you
were
more
than
a
friend
I
swear
I'll
never
call
you
bitch
again,
believe
me
That's
my
word
I
swear
I'll

peaceful
But
Mr.
Knight
and
myself
Suge
Knight
said
we
can
make
it
happen
Hey,
clap
it
up
for
yourselves,
everybody!
Give
it
up
for
fellas
up

top,
I

Hey
I
wanna
also
say,
thank
you
everyone
for
being
patient
We
wanna
make
sure
everybody

in
here
safe
and
peaceful
Ain't
nothing
but
a
gangsta
party
Ain’t
nothin
but
a
gansta
party
Ain't
nothin
but
a
gansta
party
Uh,
picture-perfect,
I
paint
a
perfect
picture
Bomb
the
suckas
with
precision,
my
intention's
to
get
richer
With
the
S-N
double-O-P,
Dogg,
my
fuckin’
homie
Did
this
cold,
how
we
fade
our
foes
Sure
'nough,
I
keep
my
hand
on
my
gun
'Cause
they
got
me
on
the
run
Now
I'm
back
in
the
courtroom,
waitin'
on
the
outcome
"Free
2Pac"
is
all
that's
on
a
nigga's
mind
But
at
the
same
time,
it
seems
they
tryin'
to
take
mine
So
I’ma
get
smart
and
get
defensive
and
shit
And
put
together
a
Million
March
for
some
gangsta
shit
So
now
they
got
us
laced
Two
multi-millionaire
motherfuckers
catchin’
cases
Bitches
get
ready
for
the
throwdown,
the
shit's
about
to
go
down
Me
and
Snoop
about
to
clown
I’m
losin'
my
religion,
I'm
vicious
on
these
stool
pigeons
You
might
be
deep
in
this
game,
but
you
got
the
rules
missin'
Niggas
be
actin’
like
they
savage,
I'm
out
to
get
the
cabbage
I've
got
nothin'
but
love
for
my
niggas
livin'
savage
I've
got
a
pit
named
Petey,
she
Nigerina
I've
got
a
house
out
in
the
hills
right
next
to
Chino
And
I
think
I've
got
a
black
Bimmer
But
my
dream
is
to
own
a
fly
casino
Like
Bugsy
Siegel,
and
do
it
all
legal
And
get
scooped
up
by
the
little
homie
in
the
Regal
It
feels
good
to
you,
baby-bubba
You
see,
this
is
for
the
G's
and
the
keys,
motherfucker
Now
follow
as
we
ride
Motherfuck
the
rest,
two
of
the
best
from
the
Westside
And
I
can
make
you
famous
Niggas
been
dyin'
for
years,
so
how
could
they
blame
us?
I
live
in
fear
of
a
felony
I
never
stop
bailin'
these
West
Coast
G's
If
you
got
it,
better
flaunt
it
Another
warrant,
two
of
America's
most
wanted
Ain't
nothin'
but
a
gangsta
party,
party
Ain't
nothin'
but
a
gangsta
party,
party
(Nothin'
but
a
gangsta
party
It
ain't
nothin'
but
a
motherfuckin'
gangsta
party)
Ain't
nothin'
but
a
gangsta
party
(Nothin'

a
gangsta
party
It
ain't
nothin'
but
a
motherfuckin'
gangsta
party)
Ain't

party
(Nothin'
but
a
gangsta

It
ain't

but
a
motherfuckin'
gangsta
party)
Give
me
fifty
feet
Defeat
is
not
my
destiny,
release
me
to
the
streets
And
keep
whatever's
left
of
me
Jealousy
is
envious,
sufferin'
is
greed
Better
be
prepared
when
you
cowards
fuck
with
me
I
bust
and
flee,
these
niggas
must
be
crazy,
what?
There
ain't
no
mercy
motherfuckers
who
can't
fade
the
thugs
You
thought
it
was,
but
it
wasn't,
now
disappear
Bow
down
in
the
presence
of
a
boss
player
It's
like
Cuzz,
Blood
gang-bangin'
Everybody
in
the
party
doin'
dope-slangin'
You
gotta
have
papers
in
this
world
You
might
get
your
first
snatch
before
your
eyes
swirl
You
doin'
your
job
every
day
And
then
you
work
so
hard
'til
your
hair
turns
gray
Let
me
tell
you
'bout
life
and
'bout
the
way
it
is
They
say
we
live
by
the
strap,
we
die
by
the
strap,
kids
They
tell
me
not
to
roll
with
my
Glock
So
now
I
got
a
throw-away
Floatin'
in
the
black
Benz,
tryin'
to
do
a
show
a
day
They
wonder
how
I
live
with
five
shots
Niggas
is
hard
to
kill
on
my
block
Schemes
for
currency
and
dough-related
Affiliated
with
the
hustlers,
so
we
made
it
No
answers
to
questions,
I'm
tryin'
to
get
up
on
it
My
nigga
Dogg
with
me,
eternally
the
most
wanted
Now

motherfucker?
(Hell
Yeah)
Now

with
this

album
The
only
way,
for
me
to
come
back,
is
by
Makaveli
That's
it!
All
these
motherfuckers
stole
from
me
I'm
taking
back
what's
mine
You
motherfuckers
can't
stop
me
(laughing)
Even
if
I
die,
I'm
gon'
be
a
fuckin
problem
Do
you
believe
in
ghosts,
motherfucker?
Real
live
black...
ghosts
Feel
me?
Some
say
I'm
crazy,
these
punk-ass
cops
can't
fade
me
Mama
tried
to
raise
me,
but
had
too
many
babies
Papa
was
a
motherfuckin,
joke
Used
to
find
dope
in
his
coat
And
nearly
choked
when
he'd
tell
me
not
to
smoke
Daaamn,
don't
get
me
started
My
mama
smoked
so
goddamn
much
When
she
was
pregnant
I'm
surprised
I
ain't
retarded
At
night
I
can't
sleep,
count
sheep
As
they
pass
through
the
glass
of
my
neighbors
five
deep
Starin
at
the
wall,
heard
a
scream
Wake
up
in
the
mornin'
See
the
blood
in
the
hall
from
the
murder
scene
Don't
cry,
just
ask
why,
and
try
not
to
die
As
I
take
you
through
a
ghetto
nigga's
lullaby
On
the
corner,
where
the
niggas
slang
they
crack
And
the
undercovers
jack
those
that
don't
watch
they
back
(Five-0)
I
daydream
about
the
dope
world
Take
a
puff
from
the
blunt
and
watch
the
smoke
swirl
My
mossberg
goes
BOOM,
what's
another
plug
Snatchin
drugs,
pumpin'
slugs
in
these
other
thugs
(GIVE
IT
UP
NIGGA)
Don't
run
out
of
breath
Every
step
could
be
death
'til
you
blast
And
be
the
last
nigga
left,
then
I'll
be
ghost
Don't
cry,
just
ask
why,
and
try
not
to
die
As
I
take
you
through
a
ghetto
nigga's
lullaby
Don't
cry,
just
ask
why,
and
try
not
to
die
As
I
take
you
through
a
ghetto
nigga's
lullaby
A
seven-deuce
full
of
niggas
goes
by
Thought
I
was
trippin'
the
second
time
they
rolled,
by
Recognized
the
plates,
the
faces
looked
familiar
Everybody
swear
they
know
the
nigga
that's
gonna,
kill
ya
Don't
murder
me
murder
me,
kill
a
nigga
in
his
sleep
Let
me
die
as
I
rest
in
peace,
deep
Back
to
these
niggas
in
the
seven-deuce
A
Mac-10
out
the
window
bout
to
let
it
loose,
what
could
I
do
Run
for
cover
and
return
fire
DIE
MOTHERFUCKIN
DIE,
hope
your
ass
fry,
don't
ask
why
But
I
let
off
everything
I
have
An
empty
clip,
hit
the
ground
as
a
nigga
dash
On
my
ass
was
the
motherfuckin
cops
now
Barely
breathin
tryin
to
keep
from
gettin
shot
down
BOO-YAOW
is
the
sound,
bullet
whizzed
by
Still
runnin
like
a
nigga
got
nine
lives
Don't
know
why
but
I'm
running
to
my
fucking
block
Took
a
shot,
tired
of
running
from
the
niggas
and
the
cops
Time
to
be
a
ghost
(Hey
man,
come
the
fuck
on)
And
then
we'll
be
ghost
Don't
cry,
just
ask
why,
and
try
not
to
die
As
I
take
you
through
a
ghetto
nigga's
lullaby
FUCK
THE
POLICE
NIGGA!
Sometimes
it's
hard
to
wake
up
in
the
morning
Mind
full
of
demons,
I
don't
wanna
hear
'em
anymore
Got
me
heartbroken,
fine,
so
many
babies
screaming
‘Cause
they
seeing
destruction
before
they
see
a
human
being
So
they
start
smokin'
weed,
we'll
never
get
our
day
Until
we
learn
to
pray,
keep
our
families
in
shape
‘Cause
they
all
broken,
why
do
ghetto
birds
die
Before
we
learn
to
fly?
Somebody
else
should
try
Cockin'
guns,
smokin',
we
can
all
make
a
change
So
I'm
told,
but
I
haven't
seen
a
change
unfold
I'll
keep
hoping,
please,
if
you
prefer
to
breathe
Communities
in
need
of
people
that
will
lead
Keep
your
eyes
open,
I
can
only
say
I'll
try
Until
the
day
I
die,
I
promise
to
be
wise
With
my
heart
open,
greed
brings
only
misery
Away
the
tragedy,
so
I
stay
sucker
free
Only
a
few
chosen
rise,
my
ghetto
queens
rise
Don't
be
afraid
to
try,
too
many
of
us
die
For
the
door
to
open
wide,
my
brothers
speak
wise
Stay
focused
on
the
prize,
though
everybody
dies
We
can
only
learn
to
take,
our
anger
and
our
hate
Control
our
mental
states,
settle
down
and
set
it
straight
Maybe
we
can
learn
to
take
a
second
to
pump
the
brakes
Before
we
said
it,
regret
it
later
and
let
it
escalate
‘Cause
by
then
it's
just
too
late,
there's
so
much
we
can
take
And
there's
only
so
much
someone
can
swallow
and
tolerate
To
the
point
that
he
just
breaks,
snaps,
and
it's
all
it
takes
You
think
that
we
was
learnin'
from
other
rappers'
mistakes
But
we
ain't,
its
grain
to
go
against
With
every
artist
comes
the
image
he
portrays
And
the
picture
that
he
paints
But
in
the
midst
of
all
this
anger
and
this
angst
Never
once
did
you
heard
me
say
I'm
a
gangster
And
I
ain't
hear
no
complaints
But
I
know
that
I
will
always
continue
to
grow
As
long
as
I
lead,
and
never
follow
in
no
one
else's
shadow
There
will
never
be
another
me,
and
that
I
can
guarantee
That's
why
the
fuck
I
remain
sucker
free
To
this
day,
the
game
will
never
be
the
same
No
matter
how
much
fame
and
success
they
attain
There
will
never
be
another
me
And
no
matter
what
they
do,
there
will
never
be
another
you
You
can
search,
but
you'll
never
find
You
can
try
to
rewind
time,
but
in
your
hearts
and
your
minds
We
will
never
die,
we
are
forever
alive
Don't
get
caught
in
the
publicity
and
caught
in
the
hype
Rappers
are
regular
people
minus
money
and
lights
Searchin'
for
fortune
and
fame
and
superstardom
All
the
jewelry,
all
the
cars,
whose
crew's
the
hardest
There's
not
a
hip-hop
police,
the
villains
is
watchin'
And
the
kids
think
beef
is
they
only
option
Outlawz
born
filthy,
guilty
as
charged
My
memories
of
Kadaf'
while
Makaveli
lives
on
You
think
the
industry
is
fun,
ain't
no
pity
with
guns
And
when
your
money
is
up,
that's
when
your
enemies
come
So
if
he
died
and
came
back,
would
he
try
to
save
rap?
We
needing
a
change,
the
drama
remains
the
same
I
spend
my
whole
life
fightin'
myself
That
I
can't
win,
so
I'm
invitin'
some
help
And
hey,
now
then,
I
take
rights
and
no
lefts
I'm
still,
just
like
a
kid,
lookin'
for
stripes
on
my
belt
Yeah,
that
there
is
a
fight
in
itself
So
I
just
pray
and
hope
God,
take
a
light
to
myself
No
matter
how
much
I
try,
stay
alive
I'ma
die
a
man,
still
standin'
and
in
love
with
my
pride
Heard
frivolous
beats,
we
past
that
I'm
tryin'
to
keep
some
income
coming
in
And
collect
on
my
ASCAP
The
rappers
in
the
game
ain't
changed
And
I
finally
realize
that
we're
not
in
the
same
game
The
hatin'
will
never
end,
so
I
guess
I'll
deal
with
it
Them
.45's
will
pop
killas,
yes,
I'm
still
with
it
The
streets
is
military,
you
gotta
be
a
soldier
Gotta
stay
leery,
and
keep
your
eyes
on
the
rollers
They
do
what
they
gotta
do
to
shackle
and
hold
us
So
we
gotta
do
what
we
gotta
do
to
keep
rollin'
One
way
at
a
time,
keep
the
faith
in
your
mind
Child:
Why
you
by
the
window?
What's
wrong
daddy?
Mother:
I
know
what's
wrong
with
that
crazy
motherfucker
He
just
stand
by
the
goddamn
window
With
that
fuckin'
AK
all
day
(there
you
go)
You
don't
work,
you
don't
fuck,
you
don't
eat
You
don't
even
do
a
goddamn
thing
I
see
death
around
the
corner,
gotta
stay
high
while
I
survive
In
the
city
where
the
skinny
niggas
die
If
they
bury
me,
bury
me
as
a
G
nigga,
no
need
to
worry
I
expect
retaliation
in
a
hurry
I
see
death
around
the
-
corner,
any
day
Tryin
to
keep
it
together,
no
one
lives
forever
anyway
Strugglin'
and
strivin',
my
destiny's
to
die
Keep
my
finger
on
the
trigger,
no
mercy
in
my
eyes
In
a
ball
of
confusion,
I'm
thinkin'
'bout
my
daddy
Madder
than
a
motherfucker,
they
never
shoulda
had
me
I
guess
I
seen
too
many
murders,
the
doctors
can't
help
me
Got
me
stressin'
with
my
pistol
in
my
sheets,
it
ain't
healthy
Am
I
paranoid?
-
Tell
me
the
truth
I'm
out
the
window
with
my
AK,
ready
to
shoot
Ran
out
of
indo
and
my
mind
can't
take
the
stress,
I'm
out
of
breath
Make
me
wanna
kill
my
damn
self;
but
I
see
death
around
the
corner
("When
we
were
kids,
belonging
felt
good..")
I
see
death
around
the
corner
("But
having
respect,
that
feels
even
better..")

I

around
the
corner,
the
pressure's
gettin'
to
me
I
no
longer
trust
my
homies
-
them
phonies
tried
to
do
me
Smokin'
too
much
weed,
got
me
paranoid,
stressed
Pack
a
gat
and
my
vest,
under
my
clothes
when
I
dress
Here's
hopin'
I
die
the
way
I
lived,
straight
thuggin'
Huggin'
my
trigger
for
all
them
niggas
that
was
buggin'
My
homie
told
me
once,
don't
you
trust
them
other
suckers
They
front
like
they
your
homies
but
they
phony
motherfuckers
And
even
if
I
did
die
young,
who'd
care
All
I
ever
got
was
mean
mugs
and
cold
stares
Got
homies
in
my
head
that
done
passed
away
screamin'
"Please!"
Young
nigga,
make
G's
I
can't
give
up,
although
I'm
hopeless,
I
think
my
mind's
gone
All
I
can
do
is
get
my
grind
on,
death
around
the
corner
("When
we
were
kids,
belonging
felt
good..")
I
see
death
around
the

(I

I
was
raised
in
the
city,
shitty
Ever
since
I
was

kiddy
Drinkin'

And

And

And

Pow!
Bustin

How

jealous
ass
bitches,

riches
Now

Cause

and
heartless,

Excuse

No

I
was
a
G
and
gettin'
high
was
a
way
of
bein'
free
I

It's
as
simple
as
that
for

As
I

the
scene
From
smokin'
green
got
my

closed
Niggas
so
cold
on
my
foes,
I
make

Watch

Got

paintin'
pictures
of
a
meal
ticket,
help

See

and
pray
for
options,
but
the
pressures
nonstop
Niggas
get
the
pistol
poppin'
and
watch
his
body
drop
I'm
a
lethal
threat,
watch
me
hit
your
set,
flash
on
Blast
on
them
bitch-made
niggas
with
my
mask
on
Do
it
for
profit,
plus
I'm
lookin'

If

"Westside!"
you

I'm
seein'
demons,

me
hearin'
screams
Scared
to
go
to
sleep,
watch
the
scene
like
a
dope
fiend
Probably
be
punished
for
it,
though
you
can't
ignore
it
I
live
the
life
of
a
thug
nigga,
and
die
for
it
Niggas
pass
the
clip

Got

Down

Squeeze

Signal

Yaki
Kadafi,

These
streets

black
hockey

sloppy
Put
a
pamper
on
your
silly
ass
prestyle
grammar,
locked
in
the
slammer,

I'm

Teach

bitches
a
lil'
somethin'
You
know
what
I
mean?
Secrets
of
muthafuckin'
war…
Between
you
and
Biggie
it
was
like,
who's
going
to
rule
the
Nigga
kingdom
and
shit,
basically,
know
what
I'm
saying?
I
was
like,
this
is
like
a
fucking
election
It
is
that
You
know
what
I
am
saying
Me
and
Biggie's
situation
is
smaller
than
that,
it's
like…
And
I
wonder
if
they'll
laugh
when
I'm
dead?
Why
am
I
fighting
to
live
if
I'm
just
living
to
fight?
(You
don't
know)
Why
am
I
trying
to
see
when
there
ain't
nothing
in
sight?
Why
am
I
trying
to
give
when
no
one
gives
me
a
try?
Why
am
I
dying
to
live
if
I'm
just
living
to
die?
Check
it,
I
grew
up
a
fuckin'
screw-up
Got
introduced
to
the
game,
got
a
ounce
and
fuckin'
blew
up
Choppin'
rocks
overnight
The
nigga
Biggie
Smalls
tryna
turn
into
the
black
Frank
White
We
had
to
grow
dreads
to
change
our
description
Two
cops
is
on
the
milk
box
missin'
Show
they
toes,
you
know
they
got
stepped
on
A
fistful
of
bullets,
a
chest
full
of
Teflon
Runnin'
from
the
police,
picture
that
Nigga,
I'm
too
fat,
I
fuck
around
and
catch
a
asthma
attack
That's
why
I
bust
back,
it
don't
faze
me
When
he
drop,
take
his
Glock
and
I'm
Swayze
Celebrate
my
escape,
sold
the
Glock,
bought
some
weight
Lay
back,
I
got
some
money
to
make,
motherfucker
And
I
wonder
if
they'll
laugh
when
I'm
dead?
Why
am
I
fighting
to
live
if
I'm
just
living
to
fight?
Why
am
I
trying
to
see
when
there
ain't
nothing
in
sight?
Why
am
I
trying
to
give
when
no
one
gives
me
a
try?
Why
am
I
dying
to
live
if
I'm
just
living
to
die?
(It's
on
me)
But
still
I'm
havin'
memories
of
high
speed
when
the
cops
crashed
As
I
laugh,
pushin'
the
gas
while
my
Glocks
blast
We
was
young
and
we
was
dumb,
but
we
had
heart
In
the
dark,
will
we
survive
through
the
bad
parts?
Many
dreams
is
what
I
had,
and
plenty
wishes
No
hesitation
in
extermination
of
these
snitches
Envious
bitches,
they
still
continue
to
pursue
me
A
couple
of
movies,
now
the
whole
world's
tryna
screw
me
Even
the
cops
tried
to
sue
me,
so
what
can
I
do?
But
stay
true,
sippin'
22's
of
brew
And
now
media
is
tryna
test
me
Got
the
press
askin'
questions,
tryna
stress
me
Misery
is
all
I
see,
that's
my
mind
state
My
history
with
the
police
will
shake
the
crime
rate
My
main
man
had
two
strikes,
slipped,
got
arrested,
and
flipped
He
screamed
"Thug
Life!"
and
emptied
the
clip
Got
tired
of
runnin'
from
the
police
And
I
wonder
if
they'll
laugh
when
I'm
dead?
Why
am
I
fighting
to
live
if
I'm
just
living
to
fight?
Why
am
I
trying
to
see
when
there
ain't
nothing
in
sight?
Why
am
I
trying
to
give
when
no
one
gives
me
a
try?
Why
am
I
dying
to
live
if
I'm
just
living
to
die?
They
wanted
a
new
regime.
And
my
regime
includes
East
coast,
includes
West
coast
I
was
more
shocked
than
anything
You
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
But
I
wasn't
more
shocked
of
him
dying
I
was
more
shocked
of
him…
Pac
is
a
strong
dude,
yo
I
know
dude,
you
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
Real
strong
So
when
they
was
like
he
got
shot,
I
was
just
more
like,
"Again?"
you
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
He
always
getting
shot,
or
shot
at
He
going
to
pull
through
this
one
again
Make
a
few
records
about
it,
and
it's
going
to
be
over
You
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
But
when
he,
when
he
died,
I
was
just
like,
"whoa",
you
know
what
I'm
saying?
Kinda
took
me
by
I
mean,
even
though
we
was
going
through
our
drama
I
would
never
wish
death
on
nobody
You
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
Because
there
ain't
no
coming
back
from
that
Aww
yeah,
uhh,
uhh
Holla
if
ya
hear
me,
yeah
Here
we
go,
turn
it
up,
let's
start
From
block
to
block
we
snatching
hearts
and
jacking
marks
And
the
punk
police
can't
fade
me
and
maybe
We
can
have
peace
someday,
G
But
right
now
I
got
my
mind
set
up
Lookin
down
the
barrel
of
my
nine,
get
up
'Cause
it's
time
to
make
the
payback
fat
Tell
my
brothers
on
the
block–better
stay
strapped,
black
And
accept
no
substitutes
I
bring
truth
to
the
youth
tear
the
roof
off
the
whole
school
Oh

I
won't
turn
the
other
cheek
In
case
ya
can't
see
us
while
we
burn
the
other
week
Now
we
got
a
nigga
smash,
blast
How
long
will
it
last
'til
the
po'
gettin
mo'
cash
Until
then,
raise
up!
Tell
my
young
black
males,
blaze
up!
Life's
a

don't

but
be
thankful
that

See

Once

Keep

Mess

Scream,

You're

Holler

Pump

To

sell-outs,

up
One
way
or
another
you'll
be
givin'
it
up,
huh
I
guess
'cause
I'm
black
born
I'm
supposed
to
say
peace,
sing
songs,
and
get
capped
on
But
it's
time
for
a
new
plan,
BAM!
I'll
be
swingin'
like
a
one
man,
clan
Here
we
go,
turn
it
up,
don't
stop
To
my
homies
on
the
block
gettin
dropped
by
cops
I'm
still
around
for
ya
Keepin
my
sound
underground
for
ya
And
I'ma
throw
a
change
up
Quayle
ain't
do
nothing
but
blow
my
name
up!
Now
my
homies
in
the
backstreets,
the
blackstreets
They
feel
me
when
they
rollin'
in
they
fat
jeeps
This
ain't
just
a
rap
song,
a
black
song
Tellin'
all
my
brothers,
get
they
strap
on
And
look
for
me
in
the
struggle
Hustlin

bubble
Holler
if
ya

me!
"Hard"
"Tellin'
you
to
hear
it"
"The
rebel"
Will
I
quit,
will
I
quit?
They
claim
that
I'm
violent,
but
still
I
kick
Representin',
never
give
up
on
a
good
thing
Wouldn't
stop
it
if
we
could
it's
a
hood
thing
And
now
I'm
like
a
major
threat
'Cause
I
remind
you
of
the
things
you
were
made
to
forget
Bring
the
noise
to
all
my
boys
Know
the
real
from
the
bustas
and
the
decoys
And
if
ya

like
a
real
G
Pump
ya
fists
if
ya
feel
me,
holla

me
Learn
to
survive
in
the
nine-tre'
I
make
rhyme
pay,
others
make
crime
pay
Whatever
it
takes
to
live
and
stand
'Cause
nobody
else'll
give
a
damn
So
we
live
like
caged
beasts
Waitin'
for
the
day
to
let
the
rage
free
Still
me
'til
they
kill
me
I
love
it
when
they
fear
me
Holler
if
ya
hear
me!
"Hard"
"Tellin'
you
to
hear
it"
"The
rebel"
You're
too
near
me,
to
see
it
clearly
Holler
if
ya
hear
me!
"Hard"
"Tellin'
you
to
hear
it"
"The
rebel"
Starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
Just
lookin'
back
at
the
world
From
another
level,
you
know
what
I
mean?
Starin'
Multiple
gunshots
clear
the
block,
the
fun
stops
Snitches
is
callin'
cops,
people
shot,
nobody
stops
I
wonder
when
the
world
stopped
carin'
Last
night
two
kids
shot
while
the
whole
block
starin'
I
will
never
understand
this
society
First
they
try
to
murder
me,
then
they
lie
to
me
Product
of
a
dyin'
breed;
all
my
homies
tryin'
weed
Now
the
little
babies
crazed,
raised
off
Hennessy
Tell
me,
will
my
enemies
flee
when
they
see
me?
Believe
me,
even
thugs
gotta
learn
to
take
it
easy
Listen,
through
intermissions,
search
your
heart
for
a
plan
And
we
turnin'
bad
boys
to
grown
men,
it's
on
again
I
give
a
holla
to
my
niggas
in
the
darkest
corners
Roll
a
perfect
blunt,
and
let
me
spark
it
for
ya
One
love
from
a
thug
nigga
Rollin'
with
a
posse
full
of
paranoid
drug
dealers
To
the
end,
my
friend,
I'm
seein'
nothin'
but
my
dreams
comin'
true
While
I'm
starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
See,
I'm
seein'
nothin'
but
my
dreams
comin'
true
While
I'm
starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
They
got
me
starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
Go
on,
baby,
scream
to
God,
he
can't
hear
you
I
can
feel
your
heart
beatin'
fast
'cause
it's
time
to
die
Gettin'
high,
watchin'
time
fly
And
all
my
motherfuckers
Starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
Go
on,
baby,
scream
to
God,
he
can't
hear
you
I
can
feel
your
heart
beatin'
fast
'cause
it's
time
to
die
Gettin'
high,
watchin'
time
fly
And
all
my
motherfuckers
Now
you
see
him,
now
you
don't
Some
niggas
be
here
for
the
moment,
and
then
they
gone
What
happened
to
'em?
Well,
let's
see,
it
seems
to
be
a
mystery
But
all
I
know
I
never
let
the
money
get
to
me
Stay
down
like
the
truest
Thug
Life
until
I
check
out
this
bitch,
I
thought
you
knew
this
Who
is
gonna
catch
me
when
I
fall
or
even
care
to?
While
you

I
see
you
lost
up
in
my
rearview
Hear

is
down
with
them
Outlawz
Outcast,
left
far,
I'm
through
like
southpaws
But
still
we
keep
mashin'
until
our
dreams
come
through
Starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
Now,
I
was
raised
as
a
young
black
male
In
order
to
get
paid,
forced
to
make
crack
sales
Caught
a
nigga
so
they
send
me
to
these
overpacked
jails
In
the
cell,
countin'
days
in
this
livin'
black
hell
Do
you
feel
me?
Keys

ignition,
use
at
your
discretion
Roll
with
a
12
gauge
pump
for

Niggas
hate
me
in
the
section,
from
years
of
chin-checkin'
Turn

Wesson
war
weapons
Heavenly
Father,
I'm
a
soldier
I'm
gettin'
hotter
'cause
the
world's
gettin'
colder
Baby,

my
guns
like

bitches
All

bustas

my
bitches!
Now
I
know
the
answers
to
the
question
“Do
dreams
come
true?”
Still
starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
I
said,
now
I
know
the
answer
“Do
dreams
come
true?”
Starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
They
got
me
starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
Go

baby,
scream
to
God,
he
can't
hear
you
I
can
feel
your
heart
beatin'
fast
'cause
it's
time
to
die
Gettin'
high,
watchin'
time

And
all
my
motherfuckers
Starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
Go
on,
baby,
scream
to
God,
he
can't
hear
you
I
can
feel
your
heart
beatin'
fast
'cause
it's
time
to
die
Gettin'
high,
watchin'
time
fly
And
all
my
motherfuckers
Nigga
Kadafi
say
Back
in
the
days
we
hustled
for
sneakers
and
beepers
Nine-six
for
Glocks
'Cause
fiends
hittin'
up
blocks
with
street
sweepers
Bless
myself
when
knowin'
rules
to
these
streets
Somethin'
I
learned
in
school
On
some
Million
Man
March
shit
for
the
peace
True
that,
only
one
life
to
lead,
a
fast
life
of
greed
Criminally
addicted,
infested
since
a
seed
We
all
die,
breed,
bleed
like
humans
Towns
run
by
young
guns,
Outlawz
and
truants
Shit's
deep,
turn
eighteen,
burn
my
will
when
I
go
Burnt
my
body
with
my
shotty,
or
choosin'
my
dough
So
while
you
reminiscin'
all
nights
out
with
the
crew
Smoke
a
blunt
for
me
too,
I'm
starin'
through
your
rearview
Hahahaha,
you
ain't
knowin'
what
we
mean
by
starin'
through
the
rearview
So,
since
you
ain't
knowin'
what
we
mean,
let
me
break
it
better
understandin'
the
world…The
world
is
behind
us
Once
a
motherfucker
get
an
understandin'
on
the
game,
and
what
the
levels
and
the
rules
of
the
game
is
Then
the
world
ain't
no
trick
no
more,
the
world
is
a
game
to
be
played
So,
now
we
lookin'
at
the
world
from,
high
watch,
behind
us
Niggas
know
what
we
gotta
do:
just
gotta
put
our
mind
to
it
and
do
it,
it's
all
about
the
papers,
money
rule
the
world
Bitches
make
the
world
go
round
Real
niggas
do
what
they
wanna
do,
bitch
niggas
do
what
they
can
Bury
me
a
G
Thug
Life
Feel
me
Thinkin'
back,
reminiscin'
on
my
teens
A
young
G
gettin'
paid
over
dope
fiends
Fuckin'
off
cash
that
I
made
Nigga,
what's
the
sense
of
workin'
hard
if
you
never
get
to
play
I'm
hustlin',
stayin'
out
'til
it's
dawn
And
comin'
home
at
6
o'Clock
in
the
mornin'
Hands
on
my
Glock,
eyes
on
the
prize
Finger
on
the
trigger
when
a
nigga
ride
Shootin'
craps,
bustin'
niggas
out
the
door
Pick
my
money
off
the
floor,
God
bless
the
tre-four
Stuck

full,
drunk
again
Sippin'
on
gin
with
a
couple
of
friends
Say
them
Thug
Life
niggas
be
like
major
pimps
Stickin'
to
the
rules
was
a
major
sin
And
if
I
die,
let
it
be
But
when
it
come
for
me,
bury
me
a
G
I
ain't
got
time
for
bitches
Gotta

More

the
average
Just
made
25
and
I'm
livin'
like
a
savage
Being
a
G,
it
ain't
no
easy
thing
Cause
you
could
fuck
around,
get
crossed
and
get
stuck
in
the
game
And
for
the
rest
of
your
life
you
will
sit
and
reminisce
Wonder
why
it
had
to
end
like
this
And
to
the
G's
you
can
feel
my
pain
Until
the

gets
born
again
You

I'm

Devil
Ain't

Get

Went

All

Back

Don't

Never

And
now
look

Calling

I'm

With

Promised

All
you

Fathers

They
kept
my

And

The

an

nightmare
You
kept
my

down

The

tried
to
keep
us

Besides
drew
they

no

With

But
now

Freedom,

Using

In

The

I'm

Waiting

I'm

Little

with
a

Learn

I'm

a

And
getting
ghost
on
the
5-0—fuck

Got
a

Hey

Cook

Holla
"one-time"
when
I

Don't

I'm
hitting

NARCs
on
a

missing

by
inches
And
they
say:
"How
do
you
survive
weighing
165
In
a
city
where
the
skinny
niggas
die?"
Tell

Dressing

They

or
the
occasional
pain
From
a
man
like
me,
who
goes
against
the
grain
Sometimes
I
do
it
in
vain
So
with
a

Hey

it's

Straight

the

a

They
came

The

heard
of
me,
and
the
aftermath
I
don't
give
a
damn
and
it
shows
And
when
I
do
a

show
I
wear
street
clothes
So
they
all
know
me
The
lyrical
lunatic,
the

MC
I
give
a
shout
out
to
your

And
maybe
then,
the
critics'll
leave
your
boy
alone,
G
On
the
streets
or
on

It
just

They
won't

The

So

Pump

It's

Now
I'm
face
to
face
with
the
devils
Cause
they
breedin'
more
rebels
than
the
whole
damn
ghetto
And
police
brutality
Shit,
it
put
you
in
the
nip
and
call
it
technicality
So
you
reap
what
you
sow
So
reap
the
wrath
of
the
rebel,
jackin'
'em
up
once
mo'
Now
the
fox
is
in
the
henhouse
Creepin'
up
on
your
daughter
while
you
sleep
I
got
her
sneakin'
out
2Pac
ain't
nothin'
nice,
I'll
be
nothin'
how
I
wanna
And
doin'
what
I'm
gonna
Now
I'm
up
to
no
good
The
mastermind
of
mischief
movin'
more
than
most
could
So
sit
and
slip
into
the
sound
Peep
the
rebel
-
the
rebel
of
the
underground
Rebel,

Rebel

They
say
they
hate
me,
they
wanna
hold
me
down
I
guess
they
scared
of
the
rebel
-
the
rebel
of
the
underground
But
I
never
let
it
get
me
I
just
make
another
record
'bout
the
punks
tryin'
to
sweat
me
In
fact,
they
tryin'
to
keep
me
out
Try
to
censor
what
I
say
Cause
they
don't
like
what
I'm
talkin'
'bout
So
what's
wrong
with
the
media
today
Got
brothers
sellin'
out
cause
they
greedy
to
get
paid
But
me,
I'm
comin'
from
the
soul
And
if
it
don't
go
gold,
my
story
still
gettin'
told
And
that
way
they
can't
stop
me
And
if
it
sells
a
couple
of
copies,
the
punks'll
try
to
copy
It's
sloppy,
don't
even
try
to
I'm
a
slave
to
the
rhythm,
and
I'm
about
to
fly
through
So,
yo,
to
the
people
in
the
ghetto
When
ya
hear
the
bass
flow,
go
ahead
and
let
go
Now
everybody
wanna
gangbang
They
talkin'
street
slang,
but
the
punks
still
can't
hang
They
makin'
records
'bout
violence
But
when
it
comes
to
the
real,
some
brothers
go
silent
It
kinda
make
you
wanna
think
about
That
ya
gotta
do
some
sellin'
out,
just
to
get
your
record
out
But
2Pacalypse
is
straight
down

wrath
of

2Pac

This
2Pac!
Is
it,
money
or
women
to
funny
beginnings,
tragic
endings
I
can
make
a
million
and
STILL
not
get
enough
of
spending
And
since
my
life
is
based
on
sinning,
I'm
hell-bound
Rather
be
buried
than
be
worried,
living
held
down
My
game
plan
to
be
trained
Military
mind
of
a
thug
lord,
sittin'
in
the
cemetery
cryin'
I've
been
lost
since
my
adolescence,
calling
to
Jesus
Balling
as
a
youngster,
Wondering
if
he
sees
us
Young
black
male,
crack
sales
got
me
three
strikes
Living
in
jail,
this
is
hell,
enemies
die
Wonder
when
we
all
pass
is
anybody
listening?
Got
my,
hands
on
my
semi-shotty,
everybody's
listenin'
Please
God
can
you
understand
me,
bless
my
family
Guide
us
all,
before
we
fall
into
insanity
I
make
it
a
point,
to
make
my
peep
bumpin'
warlike
Drop
some
shit,
to
have
these
stupid
bitches
jaws
tight
'Till
Makaveli
returns,
it's
"All
Eyez
On
Me"
(What
do
we
have
here
NOW?)
And
you
can
hate
it
or
love
it,
but
that's
what
it's
gon'
be
You
should've
listened,
I
told
you
not
to
fuck
with
me
(What
do
we
have
here
NOW?)
Now
can
you
take
the
pressure,
that's
what
we
gon'
see
Now
since
you're
crying
for
mercy
I
promise
My
success'll
be
the
death
of
you
Lo
and
behold
you
sold
your
soul
Nigga
there's
nothin'
left
of
you
Look
in
the
mirror,
ask
yourself
who
are
you?
If
you
don't
know
who
you
are,
how
could
your
dreams
come
true?
Motherfucker,
I
sat
back
and
watched
You
pretended
to
be
'Pac,
you
pretended
to
be
hot
But
you're
not
(now)
-
I
see
it
so
clear
You
can't
take
the
pressure,
you
pussy
I
warned
you
not
to
push
me
You
see
me
and
chills
run
up
your
spine
God
made
men
the
same
boy,
but
your
heart
ain't
like
mine
Press,
they
look
at
me
like
I'm
a
menace
I
was
playing
with
guns
While
your
momma
had
your
punk-ass
playing
tennis
I'm
a
nightmare,
you
see
me
when
you
dream
Wake
up,
turn
on
your
TV
and
see
my
ass
again
You
cowardly-hearted,
you
couldn't
make
it
on
your
own
Fuck
The
Source,
I'm
on
cover
of
Rolling
Stone
Hahahaha
(You
pussy!)
Only
God
can
judge
me
(that
right?)
Only
God
can
judge
me
now
Nobody
else
(nobody
else)
All
you
other
motherfuckers
get
out
my
business
(really)
Only
God
can
judge
me
now
Perhaps
I
was
blind
to
the
facts,
stabbed
in
the
back
I
couldn't
trust
my
own
homies,
just
a
bunch
of
dirty
rats
Will
I
succeed?
Paranoid
from
the
weed
And
hocus
pocus,
I
try
to
focus,
but
I
can't
see
And
in
my
mind
I'm
a
blind
man
doin'
time
Look
to
my
future,
‘cause
my
past
is
all
behind
me
Is
it
a
crime
to
fight
for
what
is
mine?
Everybody's
dyin',
tell
me
what's
the
use
of
tryin'
I've
been
trapped
since
birth,
cautious
‘cause
I'm
cursed
And
fantasies
of
my
family
in
a
hearse
And
they
say
it's
the
White
man
I
should
fear
But
it's
my
own
kind
doin'
all
the
killin'
here
I
can't
lie,
ain't
no
love
for
the
other
side
Jealousy
inside,
make
'em
wish
I
died
Oh
my
Lord,
tell
me
what
I'm
livin'
for
Everybody's
droppin',
got
me
knockin'
on
Heaven's
door
And
all
my
memories
of
seein'
brothers
bleed
And
everybody
grieves,
but
still
nobody
sees
Recollect
your
thoughts,
don't
get
caught
up
in
the
mix
‘Cause
the
media
is
full
of
dirty
tricks
Only
God
can
judge
me
Only
God
can
judge
me,
only
God
Only
God
can
judge

Only

Only
God
can

Only
God

me
now
Only

me,
only

Only
God
can
judge
me
Only
God
can
judge

Only

I
hear
the
doctor
standin'
over
me,
screamin'
I
can
make
it
Got
a
body
full
of
bullet
holes,
layin'
here
naked
Still
I
can't
breathe,
something's
evil
in
my
IV
‘Cause
everytime
I
breathe
I
think
they
killin'
me
I'm
havin'
nightmares,
homicidal
fantasies
I
wake
up
stranglin',
tangled
in
my
bed
sheets
I
call
the
nurse
‘cause
it
hurts
to
reminisce
How
did
it
come
to
this?
I
wish
they
didn't
miss
Somebody
help
me,
tell
me
where
to
go
from
here
‘Cause
even
thugs
cry,
but
do
the
Lord
care?
Try
to
remember
but
it
hurts
I'm
walkin'
through
the
cemetery,
talkin'
to
the
dirt
I'd
rather
die
like
a
man
than
live
like
a
coward
There's
a
ghetto
up
in
Heaven
and
it's
ours
"Black
Power!"
is
what
we
scream
As
we
dream
in
a
paranoid
state
And
our
fate
is
a
lifetime
of
hate
Dear
Mama,
can
you
save
me?
And
fuck
peace
‘Cause
the
streets
got
our
babies,
we
gotta
eat
No
more
hesitation,
each
and
every
black
male's
trapped
And
they
wonder
why
we
suicidal
running
'round
strapped
Mr.
Police,
please
try
to
see
That
there's
a
million
motherfuckers
stressin'
just

That
which
does
not
kill
me
can
only
make
me
stronger
That's
for
real
And
I
don't
see
why
everybody
feel
as
though
That
they
gotta
tell
me
how
to
live
my
life
You
know?
Let
me
live,
baby,
let

live
Pac,

For

Would

Ain't

So

Sold

Start

That's

Don't

Youngster

Nothin'

To

When

deep
in
my

When
I
got

Throwin'

Doin'
85
when
we
ride
Trapped
in
this
world
of
sin
Born
as
a
ghetto
child,
raised
in
this
whirlwind
Our
childhood
years
recall
the
tears,
heart
laced
with
venom
Smokin'
sherm,
drinkin'
malt
liquor
—

Me
and
my

Fell

Hands

Fuck

Automatic

My

die
We
bail
out
to
take
the
jail
back,
niggas
unite
Our
first
date,
couldn't
wait
to
see
you
naked
Touch
you
in
every
secret
place
I
could
hardly
wait
to
bust
freely
Got
you
red-hot,

happy
to

Make

My
girlfriend
blacker
than
the
darkest
night
When
niggas
act
bitch-made
she
got
the
heart
to
fight
Nigga,
my
girlfriend,
though
we
separated
at
times
I
knew
deep
inside,
baby
girl
would
always
be
mine
Picked
you
up
when
you
was
9
Started
out
my
life
of
crime
with
you
Bought
you
some
shells
when
you
turned
22
It's
true,
nothin'
compares
to
the
satisfaction
That
I
feel
when
we
out
mashin';
me
and
my
girlfriend
All
I
need
in
this
life
of
sin
Is

and
my
girlfriend
Down
to
ride

me
and
my
girlfriend
Down
to
ride
to
the
bloody
end
Just
me
and
my
girlfriend
I
was
too
immature
to
understand
your
ways
Inexperienced
back
in
the
days
Caused
so
many
arguments
and
strays
Now
I
realize
how
to
treat
you,
the
secret
to
keep
you
Being
faithful,
‘cause
now
cheating's
lethal
We're
closer
than
the
hands
of
time
Deeper
than
the
drive
of
mankind
I
trust
you
dearly,
I
shoot
blind
In
time
I
clock
figures,
droppin'
niggas
as
we
rise
We
all
soldiers
in
God's
eyes
Now
it's
time
for
war,
never
leave
me,
baby
I'm
paranoid,
sleepin'
with
you
loaded
by
my
bedside,
crazy
Jealous
when
you
hang
with
the
fellas,
I
wait
patiently
alone
Anticipated
for
the
moment
you
come
home
I'm
waitin'
by
the
phone,
this
is
true
love,
I
can
feel
it
I've
had
a
lot
of
women
in
my
bed,
but
you
the
realest
So
if
you
ever
need
me,
call,
I'll
be
there
through
it
all
You're
the
reason
I
can
stand
tall:
me
and
my
girlfriend
All
I

in
this

for
drama
While
unleashin'
on
the
old-timers,

my
mama
I
would
trade
my
life
for

Seventeen,

when
I

You

bustin'
rounds,
activatin'
a
riot
That's
why
I
love
you
so,
no
control,
down
to
roll,
unleash
After
a
hit,
you
break
apart,
then
back
to
one
piece
Much
love
to
my
one
and
only

Just

Never

A

Picture

Now
I'm

courtroom,
waitin'
on
the
outcome
"Free
2Pac"
is
all
that's
on
a
nigga's
mind
But
at
the
same
time,
it
seems
they
tryin'
to
take
mine
So
I'ma
get
smart
and
get
defensive
and

And
put
together
a
Million
March
for

So

Niggas

livin'
lavish
I've

named
Petey,
she
Nigerina
I've
got
a
house
out
in
the
hills
right
next
to
Chino
And
I
think
I've
got
a
black
Bimmer
But
my
dream
is
to
own
a
fly
casino
Like
Bugsy
Siegel,
and
do
it
all
legal
And
get
scooped
up
by
the

Regal
It
feels

You

I

I
never

If

And

Jealousy

Better

I

The

For

burst
Whenever
I
rap,
attack
Words
been
known
to
explode
on

Extreme
at

Look

Ridin'

Code

Who

Dope

Scheme

My

We

A

Don't
look
now!
How
you
like
it,
raw?
Niggas
ain't
ready
for
the
wrath
of
the
Outlawz
Never

I'm

Scarred

And

In
the
life
we
live
as
thugs
(no
doubt)
Everybody
fuckin'
with
us
(yes!),
so
can't
you
see
(life
of
an
outlaw)
It's
hard
to
be
a
man
(soldiers
in
position,
attack
formation)
Ridin'
with
my
guns
in
hand
(No
retreat,
no
surrender)
City
under
siege,
it's
like
I
can't
even
breathe
I'm
from
the
state
of
car
thieves
G.E.D.
from
the
streets
Plenty
beef
I
play
for
keeps,
arrange
the
whole
crime
scene
Mobb
peep!
They
sneak
up
from
behind
tryin'
to
creep
No
halfs
with
no
straps,
jack,
it's
on
to
bounce
back
An
ounce
of
wrath
so
bad,
it
snatched
my
style
on
death
Tell
the
gripper
I
was
sent
to
get
ya,
snip
with
clippers
Get
the
picture,
I
wrote
my
life
down
as
a
scripture
And
still
I'm
lost
in
the
land
of
the
lonely
where
ain't
nobody
holy
A
matter
of
a
fact,
we
unholy
Everybody
livin'
soley
For
themselves,
too
high
strung
to
lend
help
To
somebody
who
be
needin'
it
You
know
we
lost
hope
and
he
needin'
it
But
the
evil
it's
forever
But
I'm
rappin'
low
down,
scandalous
like
a
tramp
is
All
for
the
street
fame
on
how
to
be
managed
To
plan
shit
6
months
in
advanced
to
what
we
plotted
Approached
the
goal
on
swole
and
now
I
got
it
Uh,
I
crack
my
window,
knowin'
they'd
love
to
catch
Kastro
sleepin'
Attach
a
strap
under
my
pillow,
hand
to
hand
like
we
freakin'
Creepin'
deep
into
the
mornin'
Peepin'
out
the
weak
while
they
yawnin'
And
let
my
clout
speak
for
itself
No
doubt,
outlaw,
outta
my
mind
outta
time
you're
all
blind
Some
kind
of
life
of
mine
if
K-Dog
don't
mind
Findin'
it
funny,
matter
of
fact,
'cause
it
is
perhaps
Finally
I'll
adapt
to
it,
over
the
years
as
an
outlaw
Eh,
Napoleon
What's
up,
nigga?
Would
you
die
for
me,
nigga?
Hell
yeah
Would
you
kill
for
me,
nigga?
On
my
grandmother,
nigga
Ayy,

Let's

Watch

Well,

Snakes

Drink

we
fist
fight,
life
or
death
But

win
with
a
vest
Won't

breathin'

the
reason,
punk
bitch
on
your
breath
I
see
day
is

So

on
the
ave.,
hide
your
stash,
beware
from
them
marks
And
yo,
Makaveli,
give

them
bullets
that

left
up
in
your
belly
And
let

Death
Row
Starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
Just
lookin'
back
at
the
world
From
another
level,
you
know
what
I
mean?
Starin'
Multiple
gunshots
clear
the
block,
the
fun
stops
Snitches
is
callin'
cops,
people
shot,
nobody
stops
I
wonder
when
the
world
stopped
carin'
Last
night
two
kids
shot
while
the
whole
block
starin'
I
will
never
understand
this
society
First
they
try
to
murder
me,
then
they
lie
to
me
Product
of
a
dyin'
breed;
all
my
homies
tryin'
weed
Now
the
little
babies
crazed,
raised
off
Hennessy
Tell
me,
will
my
enemies
flee
when
they
see
me?
Believe
me,
even
thugs
gotta
learn
to
take
it
easy
Listen,
through
intermissions,
search
your
heart
for
a
plan
And
we
turnin'
bad
boys
to
grown
men,
it's
on
again
I
give
a
holla
to
my
niggas
in
the
darkest
corners
Roll
a
perfect
blunt,
and
let
me
spark
it
for
ya
One
love
from
a
thug
nigga
Rollin'
with
a
posse
full
of
paranoid
drug
dealers
To
the
end,
my
friend,
I'm
seein'
nothin'
but
my
dreams
comin'
true
While
I'm
starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
See,
I'm
seein'
nothin'
but
my
dreams
comin'
true
While
I'm
starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
They
got
me
starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
Go
on,
baby,
scream
to
God,
he
can't
hear
you
I
can
feel
your
heart
beatin'
fast
'cause
it's
time
to
die
Gettin'
high,
watchin'
time
fly
And
all
my
motherfuckers
Starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
Go
on,
baby,
scream
to
God,
he
can't
hear
you
I
can
feel
your
heart
beatin'
fast
'cause
it's
time
to
die
Gettin'
high,
watchin'
time
fly
And
all
my
motherfuckers
Now
you
see
him,
now
you
don't
Some
niggas
be
here
for
the
moment,
and
then
they
gone
What
happened
to
'em?
Well,
let's
see,
it
seems
to
be
a
mystery
But
all
I
know
I
never
let
the
money
get
to
me
Stay
down
like
the
truest
Thug
Life
until
I
check
out
this
bitch,
I
thought
you
knew
this
Who
is
gonna
catch
me
when
I
fall
or
even
care
to?
While
you
thinkin'
I
see
you
lost
up
in
my
rearview
Hear
you
is
down
with
them
Outlawz
Outcast,
left
far,
I'm
through
like
southpaws
But
still
we
keep
mashin'
until
our
dreams
come
through
Starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
Now,
I
was
raised
as
a
young
black
male
In
order
to
get
paid,
forced
to
make
crack
sales
Caught
a
nigga
so
they
send
me
to
these
overpacked
jails
In
the
cell,
countin'
days
in
this
livin'
black
hell
Do
you
feel
me?
Keys
to
ignition,
use
at
your
discretion
Roll
with
a
12
gauge
pump
for
protection
Niggas
hate
me
in
the

from
years
of
chin-checkin'
Turn

Heavenly
Father,
I'm
a

I'm

'cause
the
world's
gettin'

Baby,

my
guns
like

fly
bitches
All
you
bustas

at
my
bitches!
Now
I
know
the
answers
to
the
question
“Do
dreams
come
true?”
Still
starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
I
said,
now
I
know
the
answer
“Do
dreams
come
true?”
Starin'
at
the
world
through
my
rearview
They
got

Go

to
God,

And

Nigga

Back
in
the
days
we
hustled
for
sneakers
and
beepers
Nine-six
for
Glocks
'Cause
fiends
hittin'
up
blocks
with
street
sweepers
Bless
myself
when
knowin'
rules
to
these
streets
Somethin'
I
learned
in
school
On
some
Million
Man
March
shit
for
the
peace
True
that,
only
one
life
to
lead,
a
fast
life
of
greed
Criminally
addicted,
infested
since
a
seed
We
all
die,
breed,
bleed
like
humans
Towns
run
by
young
guns,
Outlawz
and
truants
Shit's
deep,
turn
eighteen,
burn
my
will
when
I
go
Burnt
my
body
with
my
shotty,
or
choosin'
my
dough
So
while
you
reminiscin'
all
nights
out
with
the
crew
Smoke
a
blunt
for
me
too,
I'm
starin'
through
your
rearview
Hahahaha,
you
ain't
knowin'
what
we
mean
by
starin'
through
the
rearview
So,
since
you
ain't
knowin'
what
we
mean,
let
me
break
it
better
understandin'
the
world…The
world
is
behind
us
Once
a
motherfucker
get
an
understandin'
on
the
game,
and
what
the
levels
and
the
rules
of
the
game
is
Then
the
world
ain't
no
trick
no
more,
the
world
is
a
game
to
be
played
So,
now
we
lookin'
at
the
world
from,
high
watch,
behind
us
Niggas
know
what
we
gotta
do:
just
gotta
put
our
mind
to
it
and
do
it,
it's
all
about
the
papers,
money
rule
the
world
Bitches
make
the
world
go
round
Real
niggas
do
what
they
wanna
do,
bitch
niggas
do
what
they
can
Good
Evening
I'm
reporting
live
from
Sunset
Boulevard
Where
many
excited
fans
have
gathered
with
candles
(2pac!
2pac!
2pac!
2pac!)
Awaiting
the
much-anticipated
release,
of
2Pac
Shakur's
latest
album,
Better
Dayz
This
is
yet
another
posthumous
release
by
2Pac
Which,
raises
the
question
Where
are
these
songs
coming
from?
It's
interesting
how,
the
message
in
these
songs
Is
still
relevant
today
Even
in
his
death,
he's
touching
people
with
his
lyrics
I
can
feel
the
energy
in
the
air,
as
they
count
down
to
midnight
When
the
album
will
officially
be
released
Oh,
hold
on,
I,
think
they're
doing
the
countdown
now
5,
4,
3,
2,

...
Straight
motherfuckin'
ballin'
Part
2,
Still
Ballin'
Westside!
Now,
ever
since
a
nigga
was
a
seed
Only
thing
promised
to
me
was
the
penitentiary,
still
ballin'
Ridin'
on
these
niggas
‘cause
they
lame
In
a
6-1
Chevy,
still
heavy
in
this
game—can
you
feel
me?
Blame
it
on
my
mama,
I'm
a
thug
nigga
Up
before
the
sun
rise,
quicker
than
the
drug
dealers
Tell
me
if
it's
on,
nigga,
then
we
first
to
bomb
Bust
on
these
bitch-made
niggas,
hit
'em
up,
WESTSIDE!
Ain't
nobody
loved
me
as
a
broke
nigga
Finger
on
the
trigger,
Lord
forgive
me
if
I
smoke
niggas
I
love
my
females
strapped,
then
fuck
her
from
the
back
I
get
my
currency
in
stacks,
California
is
where
I'm
at
Ridin',
passed
by
while
these
niggas
wondered
why
I
got
shot
but
didn't
die,
let
'em
see
who's
next
to
try
Did
I
cry?
Hell
nah,
nigga,
tears
shed
For
all
my
homies
in
the
pen,
many
peers
dead;
nigga,
still
ballin'
Still
ballin'
until
I
die
(Until
I

You
can
bring
your
crew,
but
we
remain
true,
motherfucker
Still

(I

Niggas
wonder
why
(They
wonder
why)
You
can
bring
your
crew,
but
we
remain
true,
motherfucker
Still
ballin'
Now
as
I
kneel
and
pray
I
hope
the
Lord
understand
When
these
guns
involved,
I
become
a
dangerous
man
Ain't
crazy
or
deranged,
I'm
sayin'
(I'm
sayin')
But
when
these
kids
go
to
spray
'em,
boy,
won't
be
playin'
With
clientele,
any
rhyme
sells
Question
is:
will
you
fuck-niggas
ride
for
real,
huh?
Bitch
nigga,
this
is
G-rated
Plus
your
homeboy

make
it,
street
game
Fugazi
I'm
elevated
to
the
top
of
this
shit
Done
fucked
around
and
put
me
and
2Pac
on
the
bitch
And
you
can
tell
'em
"Thug
Life"
was
the
reason
for
this
And
I
ride
for
any
nigga
who
believe
in
the
shit;
still
ballin'
'Til
the
day
I

You

Still

You

Still

Now

Two

Shot

Niggas

Motherfuckers

Watch!

Motherfucker,

Straight
motherfuckin'

Yeah
So
I
guess
this
is
what
it
is,
huh?
Think
it's
obvious
We
ain't
never
gonna
see
eye
to
eye
But
it's
funny
As
much
as
I
hate
you
I
need
you
This
is
music
to
be
murdered
by
Got
a
premonition
I
feel
the
end
is
near
The
beauty
starts
to
fade
The
joy
has
turned
to
pain
I
hear
the
symphony
playin'
Ten
thousand
violins
Souls
floating
away
like
feathers
in
the
wind
They
said
my
last
album
I
sounded
bitter
No,
I
sound
like
a
spitter
Who
ninety
percent
of
These
hypocrites
are
tryna
get
rid
of
But
why
would
I
get
a
chip
on
my
shoulder?
I
was
considered,
one
time,
as
the
illest
Bitch,
I'm
still
as
fly
as
your
zipper
True,
I
just
get
richer
But
if
it
was
ever
all
about
skrilla
Then
I
woulda
quit
a
long
motherfucking
time
ago
Bitch,
shut
the
fuck
up
I
should
go
say
that
shit
to
Tech
N9ne
or
to
Jigga
Nobody
said
shit
about
2
Chainz
as
long
as
he's
been
here,
shit
No
wonder
you're
mad,
now
I'm
Looking
at
them
plaques,
count
'em
(Yeah)
I'm
LL
Cool
J,
Bigger
and
Deffer,
that's
how
come
(Uh)
I
sell
like
four
mil'
when
I
put
out
a
bad
album
(What?)
Revival
flopped,
came
back
and
I
scared
the
crap
out
'em
But
Rolling
Stone
stars,
I
get
two
and
a
half
outta
Five,
and
I'll
laugh
out
loud
'Cause
that's
what
they
gave
BAD
back
in
the
day
Which
actually
made
me
not
feel
as
bad
now,
'cause
If
it
happened
to
James
It
can
happen
to
Shady
They
do
the
same
shit
to
Brady
More
people
hate
me
than
love
me
This
game
will
make
you
go
crazy
'Bout
to
go
for
B-R-O-K-E
I
was
the
G,
the
O-A-T
Once
I
was
played
in
rotation
At
every
radio
station
They
said
I'm
lyrically
amazing
But
I
have
nothing
to
say
But
then
when
I
put
out
Revival
and
I
had
something
to
say
They
said
that
they
hated
the
awake
me
I
lose
the
rage,
I'm
too
tame
I
get
it
back,
they
say
I'm
too
angry
I
need
to
get
me
some
Dre
beats
No,
I
should
hook
up
with
Tay
Keith
Fans
keep
on
pulling
me
one
way
Haters
pull
me
in
another
Got
more
hooks
in
me
than
Swae
Lee
'Bout
to
pick
up
some
weights
and
lift
'til
my
tattoo
of
Hailie's
face
stretches
They
said
I'm
just
a
whiner,
I
sound
like
a
baby
I
dish
it
out
but
can't
take
it
But
I
take
it,
dish
it
back
out
And
they
get
all
bent
out
of
shape
This
shit's
almost
comical
Wait,
and
I
meant
no
disrespect
I
wasn't
dissin'
Tech,
that
was
not
a
shot
at
2
Chainz
or
to
Jay-Z
They
probably
feel
the
same
way
because
lately
Instead
of
us
being
credited
for
longevity
And
being
able
to
keep
it
up
for
this
long
at
this
level,
we
Get
told
we'll
never
be
what
we
were
Bitch,
if
I
was
as
half
as
good
as
I
was
I'm
still
twice
as
good
as
you'll
ever
be
Only
way
that
you're
ahead
of
me's
alphabetically
'Cause
if
you
diss
me
I'm
coming
after
you
like
the
letter
V
Killing
everything,
play
this
tune,
it's
your
eulogy
It's
your
funeral,
prepare
to
die
This
is
music
for
you
to
be
murdered
by
Oh,
this
what
we
doin'?
Alright
M.A
I
like
a
bitch
that
like
to
wobble,
wobble
Shake

shake
it,
break

break
it,
uh
Nigga,
we
made
it,
made
it,
they
hate
it,
hate
it
Pro
professional,
pure
persistent,
I'm
paper
chasing
I
hate
complaining,
I
hated
waiting,
I'll
pay
for
patience
But
I
hate
to
pay
a
bill
(Hate
that)
And
I
made
a
mil'
without
a
major
deal
(I
made
that)
Yeah,
her
ass
fake,
but
she
came
for
real
(She
came,
uh)
Money
ain't
a
thing,
that
ain't
a
thing
for
real
It's
the
broke

(Huh)
And

Saweetie,

Man,

my
hoes

Neck

(Where?)
Tip

To

Same

Get

Detox
You're
gonna
need
three
SWATs
or
police
officers
at
least
to
come
pull
me
off
of
it
and
I
don't
stop
Please
dawg,
I
need
y'all
to
keep
talking
shit
'cause
I
feed
off
of
it
I
am
the
complete
opposite
of
these
retards
who
spit
these
weak
bars,
I'ma
leave
carnage
Each
thought'll
be
so
toxic,
it'll
block
the
wind
through
your
esophagus
Stop
it,
cutting
off
your
oxygen
And
I
hit
them
pads
like
a
boxing
gym
Better
watch
for
Slim,
better
get
to
popping
and
when
I'm
at
the
top
again
I
won't
topple,
I'm
giving
it
to
anyone
who
wanna
come
and
get
it
and
I'm
not
gonna
stop
But
when
they
ask
me
is
the
war
finished
with
MGK?
Of
course
it
is
I
cleansed
him
of
his
mortal
sins,
I'm
God
and
the
Lord
forgives
even
the
devil
worshippers
I'm
moving
on
but
you
know
your
scruples
are
gone
when
you're
born
with
Lucifer's
horns
And
you're
from
the
school
of
Notorious,
Puba,
Cube
and
The
Poor
Righteous
Teachers
tutored
my
students
Showed
them
all
the
blueprint
and
formula
But
it
seems
like
the
more
they
studied
my
music,
the
more
they
remind
me
of
eyeballs
I'm
watching
my
pupils
get
cornier
(Uh)
But
I'm
contemplating
yelling
"Bombs
away"
on
the
game
Like
I'm
outside
of
an
Ariana
Grande
concert
waiting
They
call
me
Saddam
Hussein,
Ayatollah
Khomeini
Where's
Osama
been?
I
been
laden
lately
Look
at
how
I'm
behaving,
they
want
me
gone
away
They
wanna
JonBenet
me
(Fuck
you),
I'm
unaccommodating
Man,
I
don't
see
why
they
hate
me
(Huh?)
I'm
a
clown
like
John
Wayne
Gacy
(What?)
They
call
me
Kanye
crazy
(Yah)
APESHIT,
Beyonce,
Jay-Z
(Woo)
And
I'm
back
with
Andre,
baby
(Yeah)
And
the
doctor's
operating
(What?)
But
he
never
put
no
scrubs
on
from
Snoop,
K.
Dot
to
Shady
Shady
like
a
shadow
or
your
silhouette,
intellect,
I
better
check
to
see
why
you
feel
upset
'Cause
I
met
your
bitch
on
the
internet
now
I'm
getting
head
like
a
Pillow
Pet
That
bimbo
can
put
her
lips
all
the
way
around
this
bone
and
then
blow
Like
a
dusty
cartridge
from
an
old
Nintendo
Those
were
the
days
but
I
bet
you,
I'm
never
gonna
be
broke
again,
no
I
don't
smoke
but
I
got
paper,
to
be
blunt,
I'm
rolling
Indo
And
I
keep
it
one
comma,
zero,
zero,
zero,
zero
Real,
real,
real,
murder,
murder,
murder,
kill,
kill,
kill
Nickel-plated,
twenty
two,
two,
two
Bitch,
shut
the
fuck
up
'fore
I
shoot
you
too
Ain't
shit
I
won't
do
just
to
get
a
few
YouTube
views
Run
up
in
a
church
like
pew,
pew,
pew
'Cause
that's
what
I
do,
do,
do
But,
even
to
the
untrained
human
eye
We
ain't
the
same,
you
and
I
Somebody
should
have
explained
to
you
why
For
you
to
go
against
me,
it's
simply
insane,
you
will
die
(Yeah)
That's
why
they
call
me
Kamikaze,
it's
plain
suicide,
yeah
But
I
know
magic
and
here
go
my
last
trick
I'm
'bout
to
say
"Abracadabra"
and
pull
a
B
Rabbit
up
out
of
my
hat
I'm
about
to
relapse
and
I
betcha
that
you
won't
know
how
to
react
But
a
look
of
disgust,
I
don't
doubt
it'd
be
that
As
I
begin
to
fuckin'
devour
the
track
And
you
backpedal,
that
is
a
cowardly
act
Like
a
Saudi
attack
when
the
towers
collapsed
They
call
me
Saddam
Hussein,
Ayatollah
Khomeini
Where's
Osama
been?
I
been
laden
lately
Look
at
how
I'm
behaving,
they
want
me
gone
away
They
wanna
JonBenet
me
(Fuck
you),
I'm
unaccommodating
Pray
you
see
tomorrow
little
boy,
you

All
them

the
urn
You

your
last

But

I'm
a
product
of
properly
hoppin'
up
out
of
that
poverty
Profitin'
all
for
coppin'
and
swappin'
that
property
out
for
a
possible
monopoly
Try
not
to
adopt
my
father's
old
philosophies
Same
time
I'm
prayin'
to
God
that
everything
works
out
at
his
colonoscopy
I'm
walkin'
across
a
suicidal
tightrope
intentionally
While
the
demons
comin'
out
of
me
Wifey's
on
the
side
of
me
talkin'
sense
into
me
Without
she,
I
feel
incomplete
mentally,
she's
been
sent
to
me
Right
there
since
'9-6,
worse
nightmare
to
side
chicks,
some
things
are
just
meant
to
be
This
it
for
me,
give
my
daughters
a
kiss
for
me
Y'all
call
this
fame,
I
call
this
shit
alcoholistic
infamy
Targettin'
my
kids
and
babies
through
population
and
gun
control
Shit
make
me
wanna
make
a
hunnid
more
Make
a
bigot
racist
uncomfortable
If
y'all
against
talk
and
reparation
then
I'm
not
against
the
thought
of
separation
While
the
politicians
that
are
white
and
privileged
ask
how
is
this
different
from
segregation,
that's
funny
bro
Segregation
is
bein'
told
where
I'm
gonna
go
Separation
is
bein'
woke
and
goin'
wherever
I
wanna
go

Never

Wanted
one
though,
they
were
so
dope
(Yeah)
Was
a
have-not
(Yeah)
'cause
my
pockets
(Uh)
Didn't
have
knots,
I
was
so
broke
On
my
last
rock,
for
my
slingshot
Better
haul
ass,
don't
be
no
slow
poke
(Nope)
Through
the
tall
grass,
run
your
ass
off
(Yeah)
Oh
no,
got
your
pants
caught
on
the
fence
post
Getting
chased,
by
them
Jackboys,
think
it's
'bout
to
fuzz
Like
a
lint
roller
they
wait
'til
it's
late,
they
will
tiptoe
Through
your
living
room
window
Take
your
Nintendo
and
then
skate
Making
you
feel
like
you
got
bent
over
and
raped
Little
boy,
you're
never
gonna
get
no
rope
chain
Get
your
shit
stole,
and
your
lip
swole,
I
became
bitter
As
I
got
a
little
bit
older,
my
hate
Was
making
me
get
cold,
and
began
to
get
a
chipped
shoulder
Started
to
spit
vulgar,
my
ZIP
code
had
been
skid
row
But
I
ate
every
single
beat
that
I
spit
over,
the
shithole
I
escaped
Then
I
began
to
explode,
detonate,
now
the
Eastside
went
schizo
Thought
my
name
was
B-side
'cause
they
flipped
over
my
tape
And
I
won't
hesitate
To
get
'em
all
bent
so
outta
shape
Oh
shit,
bro,
hold
up,
wait
I
just
tripped
over
my
cape
(Superman)
And
I'm
not
gonna
let
up,
treat
the
paper
like
I'm
chopping
a
letter
Dre'll
tell
you
how
I
shred
So
when
you
refer
to
the
guy
next
to
the
doc,
you
meant
shredder
Now
the
cops
wanna
set
up
roadblocks
on
my
head,
I
Got
several
bounties
from
feds
in
every
county
I'm
with
a
gal
at
a
Checkers
wiling
Bumping
"Fuck
Da
Police"
while
I
fed
her
Rally's
This
shit
is
like
Romper
Room
Why
do
I
feel
responsible
for
these
kids?
All

whom
I'm
a
father
to
I'm
a
God
to
you,

worship
the
water
I

Or

meet
your
Waterloo
I

to
flippin'
the
mic'
as
a
murder
weapon
I'm
poppin'
an
extra
clip,
then
cock
and

Do

and
I'll
take
a
spot
from

I'll

to
doing
what
a
leaky
faucet

But
I
ain't
talkin'

when
I
say

I'll
get
the
drop
on
you
Singin'

of
you
in
Autotune
I
am
too
volatile
and
too
grizzly
to
bear
Yeah,
shit

gettin'
to
where
I
can
barely
even
sit
in
a
chair
I
bust
my
ass
for
this
shit
and
I
swear
It
ain't
even
worth
dissing
someone
so
offbeat
That
they
can't
even
figure
out
where
their
words
Should
hit
the
kick
and
the
snare
Pray

All

My
name
is
Alfred
Hitchcock
and
this
is
Music
To
Be
Murdered
By
It
is
mood
music
in
a
jugular
vein
So
why
don't
you
relax?
Lean
back
and
enjoy
yourself
Until
the
coroner
comes
Damn,
girl,
with
your
sexy
ass,
haha
Let
me
holla
at
you
D.A.
got
that
dope
It's
one
of
those
kinda
nights
Yes,
this
beat’s
takin'
me
back
to
my
D12
days
When
we
hit
the
club
to
go
and
hell-raise
Probably
end
up
baggin'
the
cocktail
waitress
And
takin’
her
straight
back
to
the
Motel-8
Yeah,
Bizarre's
tryna
get
a
lap
dance
Off

Xanax
and
Jack
Dan'
(Ayo)
Stripper
walk
by,
I'm
like
"Goddamn"
She's
like
"That's
harassment,"
I'm
like
"Yeah,
and?"
(Woo)
Holy
Toledo,
it's
Miss
Ohio
That’s
the
best
ass
I’ve
seen
in
a
while
We
should
be
datin',
she’s
from
Cleveland
But
she's
a
bengal,
this
chick
is
catty
Is
that
a
mini-skirt
if
it's
a
maxi?
That's
the
shortest
thing
for
a
dress
since
an
addy
(Since
an
addy)
She
said
"Fuck
off"
and
threw
her
liquor
at
me
It’s
one
of
those
kinda
nights
Then
I
said,
I
said
If
you
wanna
go
hard
tonight
Well
then,
the
smoke
and
the
bottle
are
on
me,
ah
Slip
into
the
red
dress
you
like
When
we
arrive,
we
probably
won't
leave,
ah
I
love
the
way
you
move
like
that
When
you
push
your
body
on
mine,
oh
my
You
wanna
smoke,
drink,
dance
until
the
sun
rise
It's
one
of
those
kinda
nights
This
beat
keeps
takin'
me
back
like
my
ex
does
Only
'cause
how
good
the
sex
was
Hit
up
the
next
club,
met
Alexa
But
she
was
so
extra,
called
her
etcetera
Had
her
like,
"Oh
my
God
My
whole
iPod's
filled
with
your
songs,
I
mow
my
lawn
to
'em"
I
said,
"Oh
my
God,
you
know
my
songs?
That's
totally
awesome,
I'm
Marshall,
what's
goin'
on?
Ah
(Haha)
Seriously
though,
jokes
aside,
how
you
doin'?
You
straight?"
She
said,
"No,
I'm
bi"
She
said,
"Are
you
drunk?,"
I
said,
"No,
I'm
high
I'm
checkin'
out
the
chick,"
she
said,
"So
am
I"
"What's
in
the
cup,
let
me
see
that
Girl,
where
the
rest
of
that
promethazine
at?"
She
said,
"Cool,
gotta
run
out
to
my
Cadillac
though
And
I'll
be
like
Fat
Joe,
and
bring
the
lean
back"
Then
I
said
If
you
wanna
go
hard
tonight
Well
then,
the
smoke
and
the
bottle
are
on
me,
ah
Slip

the
red
dress

You

the
sun

It's
one
of
those
kinda—
OMG
Like
the
gas
in
the
tank,
she's
gettin'
low
on
me
Said
she
wants
to
go
with
me
I
said,
"Go
with
you
where?"
She
said,
"Out"
I
said,
"I'm
a
candle,
I'll
go
out
if
you
blow
on
me"
Walk
her
out
to
the
parkin'
lot,
here
comes
the
brigade
Turn
like
a
flip
page,
Swifty
look
shitfaced
Say
peace
to
McVay
and
me
and
this
chick
take
off
like
a
sick
day
Drivin'
around,
I
said,
"Let's
pull
over,"
she
said,
"No
problemo
Windows
are
dark
tint,
roll
up
the
car

Monte
Carlo
in
park,
bumpin'
Bizarre's

Gettin'
head
in
the
bucket,
Marshmello
Yeah,
I
never
in
the
club
met
a
woman
worth
knowin'
But
if
you're
ho'in
Opposites

I'm
someone,
you're
a
no

I'm

and
you're

If
you

Well

You

It's
one
of
those
kinda
nights
"This
could
never
work,"
is
what
we
said
at
first
But
whatever
this
is,
it's
working
But
we're
in
two
different
worlds
and
(Yeah)
I'm
not
your
husband
(Nah),
you
ain't
my
girlfriend
All
I
know
is
that
(What?)
When
I'm
with
you,
I'm
a
different
person,
yeah
And
I
ain't
never
met
a
chick
as
perfect
Girl,
you're
a
ten,
so
here
I
am
(Yeah)
Laying
here
with
her
again
Thinking
'bout
you
She's
asleep,
you're
texting
me
around
two
Crying
face
emoji,
you
say,
"This
is
me
without
you"
We're
sneaking
out
to
meet
at
cheap
hotel
rooms
or
Sex
in
the
car,
then
I'll
text
you
tomorrow
Do
I
question
it?
Nah,
no
objection
at
all
'Cause
both
of
us
are
still
involved,
so
As
I'm
peelin'
off,
all
I'm
thinking
'bout
is
I'm
not
happy
here
(Nah),
with
her
Rather
have
you
(Yeah),
rather
have
me
too
'Cause
you're
not
happy
there
(You're
not
happy
there),
with
him
Rather
have
me
(I
know,
but),
we’re
just
in
too
deep
You're
laying
there
with
him,
thinking
'bout
me
He's
asleep,
you
say,
"Let's
meet
around
three"
You
went
to
leave
the
house,
he
caught
you
sneaking
out,
now
he's
freaking
out
You
thought
he
was
sleepin'
soundly,
woah
You
say
you're
going
for
a
drive,
you
don't
question
him
When
he
stumbles
in,
like,
"Where
the
fuck
you've
been?"
Then
you
pump
his
ear
with
what
he
wants
to
hear
Tell
him
you
love
him,
yeah,
wipe
each
other's
tears
But
it's
been
a
couple
years
since
we
been
doin'
dirt
You
or
my
girl,
don't
wanna
see
either
of
you
get
hurt
But
now
the
lines
are
getting
super
blurred
Can't
tell
if
I'm
cheating
on
her
with
you
or
cheating
on
you
with
her
But
really,
nobody's
at
fault,
can't
help
who
you
love
Hope
they
don't
overhear
us
talk
'Cause
we
both
are
getting
sloppy
Probably
subconsciously
part
of
me's
hoping
we
get
caught
'cause
I'm
not
happy
here
(Nah),
with
her
Rather
have
you
(Yeah),
rather
have
me
too
'Cause
you're
not
happy
there
(You're
not
happy
there),
with
him
Rather
have
me
(I
know,
but),
we’re
just
in
too
deep
We're
laying
here
with
them,
thinking
'bout
us
'Cause
now
when
we
get
home,
we
get
jealous
Of
each
other
being
someone
else's
Call
us
Long
John
Silver's
'cause
we
selfish
But
I
just
wanna
see
ya
Don't
care
if
it's
at
the
Ritz
or
Motel
6
If
I'm
there
with
ya,
rich
or
poor
When
I'm
laying
here
with
ya,
it
could
be
the
kitchen
floor
I
could
stay
in
bed
with
ya
starin'
at
ya
'til
the
morn'
I
just
wanna
be
your
secret
lover,
yeah
I'd
rather
share
ya
than
to
not
have
you
at
all
So
once
a
year
or
twice
a
month
I'm
here
if
you
want
it
Yeah,
I'm
open
season
And
I'm
always
game,
so
I
keep
it
a
hundred,
dear,
haha
'Cause
we
could
never
be
each
other's
everythings,
you
got
a
wedding
ring
So
it's
him
instead
of
me,
but
I'll
be
your
second
string,
now
and
forever
because
I'm
not
happy
here
(Nah),
with
her
Rather
have
you
(Yeah),
rather
have
me
too
'Cause
you're
not
happy
there
(You're
not
happy
there),
with
him
Rather
have
me
(I
know,
but),
we’re
just
in
too
deep
(I'm
in
way
too
deep)
Ugh,
you're
a
monster
I
can
swallow
a
bottle
of
alcohol
and
I'll
feel
like
Godzilla
Better
hit
the
deck
like
the
card
dealer
My
whole
squad's
in
here,
walking
around
the
party
A
cross
between
a
zombie
apocalypse
and
B-Bobby
"The
Brain"
Heenan
which
is
probably
the
Same
reason
I
wrestle
with
mania
Shady's
in
this
bitch,
I'm
posse'd
up
Consider
it
to
cross
me
a
costly
mistake
If
they
sleepin'
on
me,
the
hoes
better
get
insomnia

Hydroxycut
Pass

In

Better

H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing
all
the

to
the

I
spray
flames
They
cannot
tame
or
placate
the
Monster
You
get
in
my
way,
I'ma
feed
you
to
the
monster
(Yeah)
I'm
normal
during
the
day,
but
at
night,
turn
to
a
monster
(Yeah)
When
the
moon
shines
like
Ice

I
look

Slick

Onyx,
told
'em
lick
the
balls
Had
'em
just
appalled
at
so
many
things
that
pissed
'em
off
It's
impossible
to
list
'em
all
And
in
the
midst
of
all
this
I'm
in
a
mental
hospital
with
a
crystal
ball
Tryna
see,
will
I
still
be
like
this
tomorrow?
Risperdal,
voices
whisper
My

is
balled
back
up
against
the

This
is
just

on
You
just
pulled
a

I'm

Quick

When

I'm

And
I
got
no
plans
to
retire
and
I'm
still
the
man
you
admire
These
chicks
are
spazzin'
out,
I
only
get
more
handsome
and
flyer
I
got
'em
passin'
out
like
what
you
do
when
you
hand
someone
flyers
And
what
goes
around
comes
around
just
like
the
blades
on
a
chainsaw
'Cause
I
caught
the
flack,
but
my
dollars
stacked
right
off
the
bat
like
a
baseball
Like
Kid
Ink,
bitch,
I
got
them
racks
with
so
much
ease
that
they
call
me
Diddy
'Cause
I
make
bands
and
I
call
getting
cheese
a
cakewalk
(Cheesecake,
yeah)
Bitch,
I'm
a
player,
I'm
too
motherfuckin'
stingy
for
Cher
Won't
even
lend
you
an
ear,
ain't
even
pretending
to
care
But
I
tell
a
bitch
I'll
marry
her
if
she'll
bury
her
Face
on
my
genital
area,
the
original
Richard
Ramirez
Cristhian
Rivera,
'cause
my
lyrics
never
sit
well
So
they
wanna
give
me
the
chair
Like
a
paraplegic,
and
it's
scary,
call
it
Hari
Kari
'Cause
e'ry
Tom
and
Dick
and
Harry
carry
a
Merriam
motherfuckin'
dictionary
on
'em
Swearing
up
and
down
they
can
spit,
this
shit's
hilarious
It's
time
to
put
these
bitches
in
the
obituary
column
We
wouldn't
see
eye
to
eye
with
a
staring
problem
Get
the
shaft
like
a
steering
column
(Monster)
Trigger
happy,
pack
heat,
but
it's
black
ink
Evil
half
of
the
Bad
Meets
Evil,
that
means
take
a
back
seat
Take
it
back
to
Fat
Beats
with
a
maxi
single
Look
at
my
rap
sheet,
what
attracts
these
people
Is
my
'Gangsta
Bitch'
like
Apache
with
a
catchy
jingle
I
stack
chips,
you
barely
got
a
half-eaten
Cheeto
Fill
'em
with
the
venom
and
eliminate
'em
Other
words,
I
Minute
Maid
'em
I
don't
want
to
hurt
'em,
but
I
did
'em
in
a
fit
of
rage
I'm
murderin'
again,
nobody
will
evade
him
Finna
kill
'em
and
dump
all
the
fuckin'
bodies
in
the
lake
Obliterating
everything,
incinerate
a
renegade
I'm
here
to
make
anybody
who
want
it
with
the
pen
afraid
But
don't
nobody
want
it,
but
they're
gonna
get
it
anyway
'Cause
I'm
beginnin'
to
feel
like
I'm
mentally
ill
I'm
Attila,
kill
or
be
killed,
I'm
a
killer
bee,
the
vanilla
gorilla
You're
bringin'
the
killer
within
me
out
of
me
You
don't
want
to
be
the
enemy
of
the
demon
who
went
in
me
And
be
on
the
receiving
end
of
me,
what
stupidity
it'd
be
Every
bit
of
me's
the
epitome
of
a
spitter
When
I'm
in
the
vicinity,
motherfucker,
you
better
duck
Or
you
finna
be
dead
the
minute
you
run
into
me
A
hundred
percent
of
you
is
a
fifth
of
a
percent
of
me
I'm
'bout
to
fuckin'
finish
you,
bitch,
I'm
unfadable
You
wanna
battle,
I'm
available,
I'm
blowin'
up
like
an
inflatable
I'm
undebatable,
I'm
unavoidable,
I'm
unevadable
I'm
on
the
toilet
bowl,
I
got
a
trailer
full
of
money
and
I'm
paid
in
full
I'm
not
afraid
to
pull
a—
Man,
stop
Look
what
I'm
plannin',
haha
I
don't
wanna
be
alone,
I
don't
wanna
be
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
I
don't
wanna
be

in
the
darkness
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
anymore
(Hello,
darkness,
my
old
friend)
Here
I
am,
alone
again
Can't
get
out
of
this
hole
I'm
in
It's
like
the
walls
are
closin'
in
You
can't
help
me,
no
one
can
I
can
feel
these
curtains
closin'
I
go
to
open
'em
But
something
pulls
'em
closed
again
(Hello,
darkness,
my
old
friend)
Feels
like
I'm
loathing
in
Las
Vegas
Haven't
got
the
vaguest
why
I'm
so
lost
But
I'd
make
you
this
small
wager
If
I
bet
you
I'll
be
in
tomorrow's
paper
Who
would
the
odds
favor?
(Hello,
darkness,
my
old
friend)
I'm
so
much
like
my
father,
you
would
think
that
I
knew
him
I
keep
pacin'
this
room,
Valium,
then
chase
it
with
booze
One
little
taste,
it'll
do
Maybe
I'll
take
it
and
snooze,
then
tear
up
the
stage
in
a
few
(Hello,
darkness,
my
old
friend)
Fuck
the
Colt
45,
I'ma
need
somethin'
stronger
If
I
pop
any
caps,
it
better
be
off
of
vodka
Round
after
round
after
round,
I'm
gettin'
loaded
(Haha)
That's
a
lot
of
shots,
huh?
(Double
entendre)
(Hello,
darkness,
my
old
friend)
And
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
(Yeah)
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
anymore
(Hello,
darkness,
my
old
friend)
Now
I'm
starin'
at
the
room
service
menu
off
a
benzo
I
can
hear
the
music
continue
to
crescendo
I
can
see
the
whole
fuckin'
venue
from
my
window
That's
when
you
know
you're
schizo
(Hello,
darkness,
my
old
friend)
'Cause
I
keep
peekin'
out
the
curtain
from
the
hotel
The
music
is
so
loud
But
it's
almost
as
though
I
don't
hear
no
sound
I
should
get
ready
for
the
show
now
Wait,
is
this
the
whole
crowd?
I
thought
this
shit
was
sold
out
(Hello,
darkness,
my
old
friend)
But
it's
only
the
opening
act,
it's
early,
don't
overreact
Then
something
told
me
relax
And
just
hope
for
the
show
to
be
packed
Don't
wanna
hit
the
stage
before
they
fill
each
row
to
the
max
'Cause
that'd
be
totally
wack
You
can't
murder
a
show
nobody's
at
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
But
what
if
nobody
shows?
Panic
mode
'Bout
to
snap
and
go
motherfuckin'
wacko
at
any
second
'Bout
to
cancel
the
show
just
as
fans
below
rush
the
entrance
Plan
is
a
go
to
wreck
shit,
cameras
in
all
directions
(Hello,
darkness,
my
old
friend)
The
press
is
'bout
to
go
ape
shit,
bananas
on
all

Commando

I
got
ammo
for
all
the
hecklers
I'm
armed
to
the
teeth,
another
Valium,
fall
off
the
bed
Hit
the
ground
and
crawl
to
the
dresser
Alcohol
on
my
breath
as
I
reach
for
the
scope
I'm
blackin'
out,
I'm
all
out
of
meds
With
them
benzodiazepines
gone
Now
it's
just
magazines
sprawled
out
on
the
floor
Fuck
the

I'm
goin'
all
out,
this
is

(Hello,

And
I

People
start

to
start
the
show
up
It's
10:05
PM
and
the
curtain
starts
to
go
up
And
I'm
already
sweatin',
but
I'm
locked
and
loaded
For
rapid
fire
spittin'
for
all
the
concert-goers
Scopes
for
sniper
vision,
surprise
from
out
of
nowhere
As
I
slide
the

in
from
inside
the
hotel
Leanin'
out
the
window,
going
Keyser
Söze
Finger
on
the
trigger,
but
I'm
a
licensed
owner
With
no
prior
convictions,
so
law
says
sky's
the
limit
So
my
supply's
infinite,
strapped
like
I'm
a
soldier
Got
'em
hopping
over

climbing

Cops

I
blocked
the
entrance
Guess
show
time
is
over
No
suicide
note,
just
a
note
for
target
distance
But
if
you'd
like
to
know
the
reason
why
I
did
this
You'll
never
find
a
motive,
truth
is
I
have
no
idea
I
am
just
as
stumped,
no
signs
of
mental
illness
Just
tryin'
to
show
ya
the
reason
why
we're
so
fucked
'Cause
by
the
time
it's
over,

so
I
will

up
and
(What?)
Be
triumphant
'cause
when
I'm

at
my
legacy
(Leg,
I

Bunch
of
dogs
tryna
dry
hump
it
Like
Triumph
The
Puppet,
so
I'm
like,
"Fuck

Pile
the
carnage
up
'til
it's
so
high,
it's
touching
the

Let
'em
all
line
up

Now

As
a
child,
picked
on,
clowned,

Countless
times
I've
been
outed
Gotta
remind
myself
of
it
every
now
and
then
(Yeah)
So
the
route
I
went's
self-empowerment
In
a
hole,
taught
myself
how
to
get
out
of
it

it
with

tricycle
And
I
don't
know
if
I
would
call
that
white
privilege,
yeah
But
I
get
it,
how
it
feels
to
be
judged
by
pigment
Besides
getting
it
from
both
sides
of
the
tracks
But
I
swore
I'd
get
them
back
Even
if
it
meant
selling
my
soul
to
get
my
revenge
and
(What?)
Thought
of
a
scheme
and
it
got
me
to
thinking
If
I
can
believe
in
myself,
I
could
prolly
achieve
it
That’s
part
of
the
reason
I
do
all
my
talking
with
ink
And
as
long
as
I'm
breathing,
I
vow
to
smother
and
beat
them
My
god,
what
a
heart
of
a
demon,
go
at
'em
and
I'ma
get
even
Like
I'm
in
the
Garden
of
Eden,
I'm
'bout
to
go
off
of
the
deep
end
This
evil
is
calling,
I'm
already
seething
and
I'm
leaving
Heaven
I'm
leaving
Heaven
Angels
won't
find
me
Where
I
am
going
Okay,
so
while
Macklemore
was
keeping
his
room
nice
and
neat
(Yeah)
I
was
getting
my
ass
beat
twice
a
week
(What?)
Looking
for
a
place
for
the
night
where
I
could
sleep
(Yeah)
Flippin'
sofa
cushions
over
just
tryin'
to
see
If
I
could
find
some
change
and
scrape
up
for
a
bite
to
eat
If
Denaun
and
me
find
a
couple
dimes
a
piece
Twenty
five
cents
each'd
get
us
a
bag
of
chips
We'd
be
glad
to
get
that
even
we
if
we
had
to
split
We'd
do
backward
flips,
looking
back
at
it
I
think
that
would
fit
with
the
definition
of
not
having
shit
Couple
that
with
the
fact
my
mother
was
batshit
Pop
was
a
sack
of
shit,
yeah,
he
died,
but
I
gave
half
a
shit
Yeah,
which
brings
me
back
to
the
dear
'ol
dad
that
I
zero
had
Since
a
year-old,
forty-seven
year-old
scab
Just
to
hear
them
words,
ear
piercing
Like
my
earlobe
stabbed
with
a
needle
for
an
earring
Should
I
feel
upset?
You
were
dead
to
me
'fore
you
died
Me?
Tear
no
shed
Should
I
have
made
a
mural
at
your
funeral?
Had
your
coffin
draped
with
a
hero's
flag?
Where
the
fuck
you
were
at
When
De'Angelo
done
hurt
me
real
bad
at
the
Rio
Grande?
Never
met
your
grandkids,
fucking
coward
Only
guts
you
had
was
from
your
stomach
fat
I
couldn't
see
your
ass
goin'
to
Heaven
So
I'm
asking
for
a
pass
to
go
to
Hell
So
I
can
whip
your
fucking
ass
I
hate
that
I'll
never
get
to
say
"I
hate
you"
to
your
face
No
coming
back
from
where
I'm
going
Sky
is
dark,
my
soul
is
black,
hand
on
the
shovel
Dig
with
the
blade
of
it
then
I
step
on
the
metal
Vendetta
to
settle,
tell
the
Devil
I'm
leaving
Heaven
(Yeah)
I'm
leaving
Heaven
(You
know,
I
should
dig
your
motherfucking
ass
up)
Angels
won't
find
me
(Just
to
spit
in
your
fucking
face)
Where
I
am
going
(Holding
my
baby
pictures
up
like
you're
proud
of
me)
I'm
leaving
heaven
(Fuck
you,
bitch)
I'm
leaving
heaven
(You
know
what?
Maybe
if
I
had
had
you)
Angels
won't
find
me
(I
wouldn't
have
went
through
half
the
shit
I
went
through,
so
I
blame
you)
Where
I
am
going
(Or
maybe
I
should
say,
"Thank
you")
('Cause
I
wouldn't
have
been
me,
haha)
So
you
better,
you
better
run
(Yeah)
You
better,
you
better
run
(So
I'ma
let
it
go
now,
rest
in
peace)
You

better
run
(Cocksucker,

I

Papers

I

Denaun
Here

Leave

Never

I
just

I

When
they
ain't
buttoned
up
right,
I
adjust
on
the
fly
Middle

that's
why
they
call
it
a
bird
'Cause
you
put
it
up
in
the

And
I'm
like
a
spider
crawlin'
up
your
spinal
column
I'm
climbin'
all
up
the

And
dive
in
a

of
Tylenol,
you're

To
a
diabolical
gynecologist

Fuck

me,
double

I

Bill
O'Reilly
I'ma

I

when
they
call
me
the

Weinstein

I'm

I'm

Me

Had

Don't

Don't

Ayo
(This
a

about)
My,
my
stepdad
(Let's
see
if
this
ever
happened
to
you)
I,
I
hate
My,
my
stepdad
One
thing
that
sticks
in
my
craw
When
I
was
six
and
I
saw
my
stepfather
hittin'
my
Ma
Socked
her
right
in
her
eyeball
I'm
startin'
to
think
I'm
psychotic
With
all
the
pictures
I
draw
of
Shit
that
I've
already
witnessed,
it’s
probably
twisted
my
thoughts
All
I
can
hear
is
drama
with
Mom
and
him
I
can
always
hear
'em
arguin'
down
the
hallways
The
walls
are
thin
so
the
noise
is
startin'
to
feel
like
the
norm
Our
dog
pissed
on
the
carpet,
he
stomped
it
so
hard
Doctors
had
to
put
it
down
He
killed
my
chihuahua,
this
motherfucker!
I,
I,
hate
My,
my
stepdad
(Stepdad)
So
tonight
I'm
sayin',
"Bye-bye
stepdad"
(Stepdad)
Outside,
I
look
like
I'm
calm
Inside,
I'm
a
tickin'
time
bomb
'Cause
of
this
motherfucker,
who
sticks
his
dick
in
my
mom
(My
mom)
Last
night,
he
said
I
left
the
kitchen
light
on
But
he
walked
in
there
this
morning
and
purposely
flipped
it,
I
saw
him
Hickory
switch
to
my
bottom,
I
counted
sixty-nine
times
He
swatted
me
with
it,
I'd
cry
He
just
started
hittin'
me
harder
God,
I
wish
I
could
just
jaw
him
If
I
could
get
my
weight
up
But
I'm
just
a
second
grader
This
prick
is
bigger
than
I
am
But
I've
been
readin'
at
school
about
this
shit
called
liquid
cyanide
I'm
fantasizin'
at
night
when
he's
sleepin'
at
just
the
right
time
Sneak
up
with
a
lethal
injection
And
put
him
down
like
they
did
to
my
dog
I'm
talkin'
euthanasia
(Euthanasia),
like
kids
in
Taiwan
This
fuckin'
shit's
like
Saigon
(Saigon)
Neighbors
called
police
on
him
So
many
battery
charges,
this
dude's
like
lithium-ion
Then
Mom
and
him
let
bygones
(Bygones)
Just
be
bygones
So
on
eggshells,
I
walk
and
just
try
not
to
piss
this
guy
off
But
this
is
why
I...
I,
I,
hate
My,
my
stepdad
(Stepdad)
So
tonight
I'm
sayin',
"Bye-bye
stepdad"
(Stepdad)
So
this
year,
I'm
goin'
into
the
fifth
and
I'm
tall
I'm
five
foot
six
on
my
block,
I'm
the
toughest
kid
but
I
got
Way
bigger
fish
to
fry
Which
is
why
I'm
tryin'
to
get
this
bitch
to
fly
off
The
handle
and
wait
for
the
fist
to
fly
to
put
this
guy
in
a
pine
box
He's
always
lookin'
for
chaos
but
tonight
I've
cooked
up
a
plan
So
this
Christmas,
I
got
some
color
books
and
some
crayons
I'm
layin'
on
the
floor,
in
the
living
room
with
some
friends
colorin'
He
walks
by,
kicks
my
arm
and
goes,
"Oops"
and
just
laughs
I
yelled
for
Mom
(Mom)
and
as
she's
rushin'
to
my
defense
I
stood
up
and
said,
"Fuck
you,
punk"
and
I
took
off
and
ran
To
my
bedroom,
as
I
fled
Knowin'
shit
would
hit
the
fan
Slammed
the
door
and
hid
behind
it
with
an
aluminum
bat
He
kicked
it
in
I
swung
it
hard
as
I
could
at
his
head
His
noodle
went
splat,
he
fell
right
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
I'm
a
little
bit
scared
but
my
anger's
overtooken
the
fear
I
threw
down
the
bat
and
just
started
whoopin'
his
ass
Beat
him
with
my
bare
hands,
the
big
bad
wolf
ain't
so
bad
"Ding-dong,"
the
pussy
is
dead,
the
bully
finally
gets
his
Stomped
him
until
he
pissed
enough
to
fill
a
two-liter
with
Then
buried
him
next
to
my
dog
And
if
I
go
to
juvie
for
this,
I'ma
tell
'em
I,
I,
hate
My,
my
stepdad
(Stepdad)
So
tonight
I'm
sayin',
"Bye-bye
stepdad"
(Stepdad)
'Cause
I,
I,
hate
My,
my
stepdad
(Stepdad)
So
tonight
I'm
sayin',
"Bye-bye
stepdad"
(Stepdad)
My
name
is
Marsh
and
this
world,
I'm
out
of
it
(Out
of
it)
'Cause
with
all
this
A-B-C
shit,
I'm
starting
to
sound
like
ALF
a
bit
Ha,
I
kill
me,
this
medicine's
counterfeit
I
was
mislead
by
the
sound
of
it,
how
am
I
gonna
get
turnt
up
on
this
Valium
shit?
(Yeah)
Checked
in
at
the
Royal
Garden
To
chill
and
avoid
my
problems
Until
paranoia
caused
me
To
feel
like
I'm
going
bonkers
For
real,
think
my
toilet's
talkin'
I
spilled
like,
like
forty
bottles
Of
pills,
think
your
boy
is
startin'
To
feel
like
a
spoiled
carton
of
milk
'Cause
it
just
occurred
My
girl's
cheatin',
I'm
kickin'
that
fucking
bitch
to
the
curb
But
the
word
"fucking"
ain't
meant
to
be
a
descriptive
word
The
type
of
bitch
she
is,
ain't
no
adjective,
it's
a
verb
Ho
thinks
her
snatch
is
magical
But
that's
how
she
attracts
men,
though
Traps
'em
and
attack
similar
to
an
actual
arachnid
Or
a
vaginal
tarantula
or
black
widow
In
fact,
it'll
be
nothin'
to
throw
that
lil'
bitch
with
a
capital
B
out
the
back
window
Of
the
black
Cadillac
limo
like
a
whack
demo
When
I'm
strapped,
when
I
spit
rapid,
like
a
ratchet
A
halfwit,
I'll
aim
at,
then
I'll
Been
fire
bitch,
I
can
outrap
Reynolds
A
pad
and
pen'll
be
great,
but
a
napkin'll
do
Return
of
the
whack
sicko
Head
spinnin'
like
Invisibl
Skratch
Piklz
Yeah,
Shady's
back,
see
the
bat
signal
It's
time
to
go
bat
shit,
like
you
accidentally
ate
a
Louisville
slugger
and
crapped
it
I'd
like
to
introduce
myself
Hi
there,
bitch...
My
name
is
Marsh
and,
I'm
out
this
world
(This
world)
S
on
my
chest
(Superman)
like
it's
plural
(It's
lit)
Call
me
extra,
extraterrestrial
Extra,
extra,
extraterrestrial
(Skrrt,
yeah)
I
could
keep
beefin',
fuck
is
the
point?
I
could
make
it
really
difficult
for
motherfuckers
to
come
to
Detroit
If
you're
still
looking
for
smoke,
I
already
gave
you
an
L
I'd
rather
just
see
you
in
Hell,
but
I
should
get
Puff
on
the
joint
(Diddy)
Wait,
run
it
back,
I
said
give
you
an
L,
inhale
Puff
on
the
joint,
I
am
the
blunt
you
avoid
Used
to
get
jumped
for
my
ProWings
When
I
was
growing
up
they
said
a
Slinky's
a
wonderful
toy
My
mother
thought
I
was
such
a
fun
little
boy
"Oh,
what
a
bundle
of
joy"
Until
the
morning
she
suffered
a
punch
in
the
groin
From
a
tantrum
I
was
throwing
Like
a
motherfuckin'
disgruntled
employee
I
don't
cut
the
beat
'til
I
fuckin'
destroy
it
Once
I
get
going,
rain,
thunder,
it's
storming
Puddles
are
forming,
I
hear
somebody's
voice
In
my
head,
say
it's
still
a
dream
Then
he
said
kill
emcees
Trippie
Redd,
with
pills
and
lean
Sipping
meds
in
the
limousine
Getting
head,

My
name’s
Marsh
and,
I'm

(It's
lit)
Call
me
extra,
extraterrestrial
(Yeah)
Extra,
extra,
extraterrestrial
Yeah
So
all
of
y'all
can
just

a
penis
(Suck

penis)
I'll
do
the
opposite
(I'll
do
the
opposite)
Eat
you
pussies
like
cunnilingus
(Like
cunnilingus)
There
ain't
no
stoppin'
it
(There
ain't
no
stoppin'
it)
They
say
I'm
such
a
genius
(They
say
I'm
such
a
genius)
When
that
Kamikaze
hit
(When
that
Kamikaze
hit)
Now
they
call
me
"butterfingers"
(They
call
me
"butterfingers")
'Cause
I
just
keep
droppin'
shit
(I
just
keep
droppin'
shit)
You
wanna
butt
heads?
Shut
up,
Beavis,
haha
I
got
your
bitch
with
her
butt
out
I'm
hittin'
a
lick
'cause
she
stickin'
her
tongue
out
(Bitch)
You
got
no
hitters,
you
might
be
pitchin'
a
shut
out
She
'bout
to
give
up
the
dugout
(Yeah)
I
should
just
live
in
a
nuthouse
Right
now,
I
live
in
an
igloo
(Yeah)
And
I'm
not
chillin'
the
fuck
out
Treat
you
like
a
stepparent,
does
to
a
stepchild
with
red
hair
and
Plus
I
get
dough
like
Ed
Sheeran,
so
call
me
the
ginger
bread
man
I'm
a
stan
of
Redman,
X-Clan
and
I'm
a
Treach
fan
But
I
look
up
to
myself
(Yeah)
Like
a
fucking
headstand
(Yeah)
So
why,
w-w-why
else
would
I
call
myself
an
alien?
How
could
I
hit
a
dry
spell?
(Yeah),
I'm
named
after
the
wetlands
I'm
Marsh
and,
I'm
out
this
world
(This
world)
S
on
my
chest
(Superman)
like
it's
plural
(It's
lit)
Call
me
extra,
extraterrestrial
(Yeah)
My
name
is
Marsh
and,
my
name
is,
my
name
is
My
name
is
Marsh
I
could
be
with
anybody,
I
choose
you
Still,
it's
no
excuse
to
abuse
you
But
no
one
knows
what
I'm
goin'
through,
so
I'd
use
you
To
be
truthful,
I
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
if
I
lose
you
So
I
refuse
to,
might
have
a
screw
loose
and
a
fuse
blew
But
I
think
I
might
be
buildin'
up
a
tolerance
to
you
'Cause
one
minute
I'm
hollerin',
"Screw
you"
Next,
I
take
it
back,
guess
you
can
say
I'm
tryna
unscrew
you
But
the
shit's
about
to
pop
off,
yeah,
I
feel
you
up
Then
I
got
you
totally
open
as
soon
as
I
take
your
top
off
You're
so
hard
to
resist,
you
knock
my
socks
off
My
friends
say
you're
bad
for
me,
hogwash
I'll
never
love
again
The
way
I
loved
you
Did
you
find
someone
new?
Are
you
doin'
this
with
them?
'Cause
I
remember
when
Still
remember
when
you
was
mine,
yeah
We
were
inseparable
at
one
time,
yeah
You
know
my
love
for
you
was
undying,
yeah
Used
to
always
have
my
back
Some
days
it
feels
like
you're
all
that
I
have
That's
why
I'm
tryna
hold
onto
you
for
as
long
as
I
can
And
you
just
want
me
for
my
money
so
I
got
you
wrapped
all
in
saran
Damn,
talk
about
eatin'
out
the
palm
of
my
hand
But
if
not
for
my
financials
I
wouldn't
have
you
anyways,
there
have
been
ample
Plenty
days,
where
I'm
just
in
a
daze
and
I
can't
pull
Myself
up
out
this
rut
and
you're
so
much
of
a
handful
I
can
only
take
so
much
of
you
all
at
one
time
Because
too
much
of
you's
just
too
much
to
swallow
sometimes
Gotta
take
you
in
doses,
but
when
you're
not
at
my
side
I
shake
in
convulsions,
separation
anxiety
'cause
we
may
be
the
closest
Yeah,
baby,
we
hopeless,
don't
we
make
an
atrocious
Combination?
We
know,
it's
like
playin'
with
explosives
Quite
dangerous
though,
but
my
brain's
in
hypnosis
Such
a
wide
range
of
emotions
Migraines,
but
why
the
fuck
am
I
takin'
these
MOTRINs?
Ibuprofens,
like
a
drop
of
rain
in
the
ocean
And
you're
my
fix
on
the
days
when
I'm
broken
But
the
shit's
about
to
go
sideways,
I
just
know
it
I'll
never
love
again
The
way
I
loved
you
Did
you
find
someone
new?
Are
you
doin'
this
with
them?
'Cause
I
remember
when
Still
remember
when
you
was
mine,
yeah
We
were
inseparable
at
one
time,
yeah
You
know
my
love
for
you
was
undying,
yeah
Used
to
always
have
my
back
So
I
spiral
downwardly
'cause
I'm
too
cowardly
to
leave
you
Head
is
clouded
in
a
fallacy,
but
in
reality
Somehow
it
seems
like
when
I
lay
me
down
to
sleep
I'm
counting
sheep
You're
bound
to
creep
'Cause
every
time
I
turn
around,
you
keep
runnin'
out
on
me
You're
my
Xanax
and
my
valium,
I'm
an
addict,
you're
a
downer
You're
my
habit,
it's
like
I
found
you
in
the
cabinet
But
it's
like
I
can't
uncap
it
'cause
it's
childproof
A
scoundrel
and
fiend's
how
I
feel
around
you
Awful,
every
time
I
lost
you,
felt
like
I
had
you
in
my
pocket
Now
I'm
flippin'
over
the
furniture,
punchin'
holes
in
the
walls
through
Everything
that
we've
gone
through
How
many
times
you've
fucked
me
But
the
way
it
felt
for
me
to
be
on
top
when
I
was
on
you
Swore
my
fealty,
but
word
to
G.O.D
I
thought
you
loved
me,
bitch,
you
tried
to
kill
me,
I'm
getting
off
you
Quit
callin'
for
me,
hard
proof's
how
I
respond
to
The
Ambien
and
Tylenols
too
Fuck
all
you
Fuckin'
bitch
We're
done
I
trust
that
everyone
is
enjoying
the
music
As
the
title
of
the
album
suggests
This
was
meant
for
your
listening
pleasure
While
you
are
being
done
in
Call
this
evil
intent,

me
in
a
limo
(Yeah)
Like

these
windows
Smoke

But

Ball

’Cause

No,

Too

Sue
Atkins
The
kinda
crazy
you
can't
fix
I'm
still
the
one
that
your
parents
hate
I’m
in
your
house
eatin'
carrot-cake
While
I
sit
there
and
wait
and
I
marinate
I'm
irritated,
you
'bout
to
meet
a
scary
fate
And
come
home
to
find
yourself
starin'
straight
into
a
fuckin'
barrel
like
Sharon
Tate
Raise
the
concerto
while
I
narrate
Yeah,
you
be
on
the
straight
and
narrow
like
a
fuckin'
arrow
shape
I
be
on
a
higher
plane
in
aerospace
With
so
much
leg-room
and
air
space
on
this
airplane
Unlike
you
'cause
you’re
on
a
flight
too,
but
it’s
a
staircase
Now,
little
engine

I

Stop
dwelling,

stop
yelling
I'm
not
yelling,
you're
yelling
Smart-aleck,
goddammit
Fuck
is
that?
Stop
hammering
(Goddamn)
That's
what
it
sounds
like
in
my
brain
Much
as
I
fight
to
restrain
I
have
the
right
to
remain
violent
Any
rhyme
that
I
say
can
and
will
be
used
against
you
Icicle
veins,
mics
will
get
slain
Life,
it
will
strangle
you
with
bicycle
chain
You’re
gonna
have
to
come
identify
the
remains
Wait,

I
said
my
head
is
twisted
like
a
bread
tie
(Yup)
Can't

I

said,
"No,

a
liar"
She
said,
"No,

Heard

Now,

And

Yayo
(I'm

No,

(Oh),

You

I
was

(Yeah)
But
still
as
explosive
with,
just
load
the
clip
Two
pistols
on
hip,
both
are
gripped
I
hold
them
at
shoulder
width
Took
a
stab
in
the
dark
and
broke
the
tip
Of
my
knife
off,
but
your
throat
is
slit
'Cause
I'm
cutthroat
to
the
utmost
with
it
The
ultimate
I
just
let
the
poker
chips
fall
where
they
were
supposed
to
fit
Now
those
days
are
over,
scrapin'
change
in
sofas
Tryna
save
at
Kroger
(Yeah)
So
why
would
I
give
a
fuck
about
backstabbin'
Trader
Joe
for?
How
'bout
that,
I'm
paid
as
Oprah
Think
I
may
have
broke
the
scale
'Cause
the
wait
is
over
But
wait,
wait,
hold
up,
'cause
they
say
I
almost
I
almost
lost
it
I
had
to
reach
back,
back,
and
lock
it,
yeah
(Lock
it,

it)
You
almost

and
sulk
'Cause
I'm
getting
green,
Incredible
Hulk
'Cause
I
usually
get
it
in
bulk
But
I
still
will
stomp
your
head
to
a
pulp
(Yeah)
You
want
smoke,
I
got
the
tical
like
Method
Man
So
get
ready
to
die
from
second
hand
Get
a
whiff
of
the
doctor's
medicine
Like
sedatives
you'll
get
popped,
Excedrin
'Cause
you
can
get
it
like
over
the
counter
(Yo)
Like
I
just
left
the
damn
concession
stand
(Yeah)
A
mic
in
my
hand's
a
weapon
(What?)
I
put
that
on
everything
like
ranch,
I'll
never
land
I'm
too
fly,
I
don't
plan
to
ever
Cinderella
Man
What
I
am
is
better
than
Every
single
one
of
you
Whether
separate
or
all
of
you
band
together
And
I
put
the
game
on
the
pill
(Yeah)
Now
my
Shady
babies
are
all
stillborns
Meaning
abortions
that
live
'cause
they
were
still
born
I
can
heal
'em
with
Neosporin
You
'bout
to
experience
euphoria
(I'm
a)
true
warrior,
got
the
plug
like
Trugoy
Give
me
the
cue
like
I'm
ScHoolboy
And
I'll
treat
the
beat
like
a
pitbull
would
do
to
a
chew
toy
and
destroy
it,
'cause,
boy,
I
I
almost
lost
it
I
had
to
reach
back,
back,
and
lock
it,
yeah
(Lock
it,
lock
it)
You
almost
got
me
(Stop

I
had

You
almost
(Stop

(I

Ricky
Racks
For
what
it's
worth
You
were
a
slut
at
birth
If
the
world
had
a
dick
You'd
fuck
the
Earth
I
tried
to
get
over
you
It
doesn't
work
You're
still
a
cunt
I'm
still
a
fucking
jerk
Same
as
it
ever
was,
yeah
Say
it'll
change
but
it
never
does
Ain't
gonna
ever
'cause
You're
the
cause
of
my
pain
and
the
medicine
Never
met
someone
who
played
games
with
my
head
as
much
Fate
tethered
us
together
like
two
felons
Must've
fell
in
love
with
skeletons
Everyone's
got
'em,
thought
that
you
were
Cinderella
but
(Yeah)
Feels
like
I
slept
with
the
(Uh)
wicked
stepmother
But
how
the
hell
am
I
Still
in
love
with
the
motherfucking
chick
there's
at
least
a
million
of?
They
say
love
the
one
you
with
But
this
shit
is
killing
us
Our
love's
on
some
other
shit
I'm
a
glutton
for
punishment
You're
the
gloves,
I'm
the
punching
mitts
It's
above
and
beyond
us
Cuffing,
I'm
shoving
the
girl
I
love
inside
of
an
oven
If
I
catch
you
sucking
another
dick
You
better
unsuck
it,
you
snuck
in
the
crib
and
tried
to
jump
under
the
covers
again
Why
am
I
tucking
you
in?
Probably
'cause
I
gotta
tell
myself
another
lie
'Cause
that's
what
helps
to
get
me
by
'Cause
I'm
in
Hell
This
is
my
goodbye,
farewell
Wanna
hold
you,
wanna
choke
you,
wanna
love
you
Wanna
hate
you,
wanna
kill
you,
wanna
hurt
you
Wanna
heal
you,
yeah
Wanna
lose
you,
keep
you,
bruise
you
Beat,
abuse
you,
treat
you
mutual
It's
juvenile,
delusional,
as
usual
You're
beautiful,
I'm
average
(Woo)
I'm
brutal,
you're
a
savage
My
ride
or
die
chick
who's
always
cruising
for
a
bruising
Yeah,
it's
kinda
like
we're
tryna
light
a
dynamite
stick
Though
we
might
get
along
like
shit
Fight,
hit,
bite,
spit,
unite,
split
Yeah,
you're
awful,
but
you're
mine
And
they
say
love
is
blind,
we
see
each
other
fine
But
it's
no
wonder
I'm
(Yeah)
the
only
one
you'll
find
(Uh)
To
put
up
with
your
shit
(What?),
I
need
a
plumber
line
(Yeah)
But
nothing
comes
to
mind
(Nah)
besides
the
number
90
(No)
'Cause
since
'06
you
flipped
my
fucking
life,
upside
down
Now
the
sky's
ground,
look
at
my
frown,
it's
a
smile
now
Look
at
my
mouth,
it's
my
eyebrows,
make
it
rain
upwards
We're
on
that
ninth
cloud,
two
insane
lovebirds
I
should
fly
south,
'cause
man
am
I
great,
ain't
lyin'
to
myself
But
I'm
just
plain
stubborn,
I'm
Audi
five
thou'
But
this
is
my
house,
bitch,
you
get
out
Then
we
duke
it
out,
then
it
dies
down
Then
we
say,
"Fuck
it",
cry
our
eyes
out
Then...
I
gotta
tell
myself
another
lie
'Cause
that's
what
helps
to
get
me
by
'Cause
I'm
in
Hell
This
is
my
goodbye,
farewell
This
relationship
is
all
that
it's
cracked
up
to
be
Never
lack
lust
in
that
'cause
we
act
nuts
'Cause
that's
what
attracts
us
Trick
you
with
a
back
rub
Tell
you
to
relax
then
dump
your
ass
in
the
bathtub
(Haha)
Yeah,
now
that's
love,
may
sound
pathetic
But
fuck
the
world
'cause
they
out
to
get
us
I
love
you
but
I
won't
exchange
vows
Hey
now,
don't
get
carried
away
No
way
I'll
get
married,
it'll
take
a
rain
cloud
to
wed
us
Yeah,
but
we're
so
insane
‘bout
each
other
May
take
the
same
route
and
way
out
as
Junior
Seau
Break
out
Berettas,
lay
down
in
bed
and
blow
our
brains
out
together
Who
knows
how
it's
gonna
play
out?
Or
whether
death's
what
our
ending
will
be
One
of
us
shot
in
the
back
while
attempting
to
flee
But
I‘ll
go
to
bat
for
you,
defending
your
honor
Yeah,
no
contingency
fees,
something
we’re
not,
nah
We're
not
pretending
to
beef,
don't
cost
a
penny
to
be
with
me
Time
we're
spending
is
free,
we
could
be
broke
as
a
joke
Won't
make
a
difference
to
me,
don't
have
to
give
me
a
thing
Could've
been
a
50
cent
ring
from
out
of
a
vending
machine
Love
unconditionally,
there's
no
other
fish
in
the
sea
Guess
I'm
a
prisoner,
see,
addiction
is
a
disease
I
gotta
tell
myself
another
lie
'Cause
that's
what
helps
to
get
me
by
'Cause
I'm
in
Hell
This
is
my
goodbye,
farewell
Love
you
girl,
do
you
feel
the
same?
I
don't
wanna
play
games,
no

ah
You're
the
only
one
that
can
out
my
flame
Baby,

it
straight,
straight,
no
games,
ah
(Oh,
oh,
yeah)
Yeah
You
know,
if
I
had
a
chance
to
do
it
all
over
again
(Oh,

I
wouldn't
change
shit
(Oh,

D.A.

You

I

'Vette

Put

(I
ain't
havin'
regrets)
I've
been
feeling
so
alone,
just
like
I'm
so
lost,
just
like
I'm—
Yeah,
they
miss
the
old
me
I
think
they
want
me
to
OD
on
codeine
They
want
my
life
in
turmoil
like
in
'03
They
want
front
row
seats,
I
give
'em
nosebleeds
They
want
me
imploding,
exploding,
self-loathing,
eroding
I'm
screaming
at
'em
with
no
regrets
and
I'm
hulking
I'm
rippin'
out
of
my
clothing
I
had
to
go
see
the
doc
like
Kool
Moe
Dee
(Yeah)
Never
took
much
to
convince
Dre
Never

Yeah,
I
live
on
the
edge,
I
sit
on
the

To
shit
on
your
heads,
I
been
on
the
bench
Forgive
and
forget
is
the
only
thing
I'd
ever
live
to
regret
Hell-bent
on
revenge,
you
left
me
for
dead
I
crawled
out
my
grave,
you
better
be
ready
and
set
My
enemies
ain't
put
an
end

(I'm

You
been
through
the

I
made
you
a
star
(I'm
screamin'

I
been
movin'
slowly,
tryna
play
it
low,
the
'Vette

like
a

(Screamin'
out
no
regrets,
yeah,
no
apologies,
I
ain't
takin'

Put
you
through
dumb
shit,
got
you
thinkin'
I
run
shit
(I
ain't
havin'
regrets)
I've
been
feeling
so
alone,
just
like
I'm
so
(Yeah)
lost
All
the
hate,
can't
tell
exactly
where
it
stems
from
But
it's
happening
again,
huh?
Y'all
used
to
be
in
my
corner
Now
you
just
backed
me
in
one
Innocent
bystanders,
I'm
bound
to
hit
some
For
some
adversaries,
I
carry
big
guns
So
some
targets'll
get
the
kill
shot
Some,
I
just
barely
nicked
'em
I
can
make
a
mistake
and
erupt
and
end
up
takin'
a
dump
Or
sayin'
some
dumb
shit,
thinkin'
I
run

Misplacin'
my
anger
enough
to
give
Earl
and
Tyler,
The
Creator
the
brunt
(Yeah)
Shoulda
never
made
a
response,
shoulda
just
aimed
for
the
fake
ones
Them
traitorous
punks,
'cause
snakes
are
just
cunts
They
can
get
fucked
with
eight
hundred
motherfuckin'
vibrators
at

(Yeah)
And
for
any
of
those
who
may
have
come
close
to
about
dyin'
And
can't
listen
to
"Arose"
without
cryin'
For
those
who
feel
low
like
you're
'bout

But
this
is
only
for
those
that
I'm

Weapon

They

about
my
daughters
hopin'
I
fly
off
of
the
handle
(Handle)
'Cause
my
first
thought
is
to
trample
and
write
a
thousand
bars
But
sometimes
it's
like
dropping'
an
anvil
on
a
house
of
cards
Or
Godzilla
squashin'
a
crouton
with
combat

Or

Can't

You

I

(I

I've
been

I'm
so

I'm—
And
I
don't

that
I
can
stop
it
(Here
it
comes)
I
do
my
best
to
try
to
block
it
(Redrum)
I've
been

(Head's
numb)
I'm
blacking
out,
you
better

it
(It's

I

I
heard
a

And

Why

with

(Pew)
I
thought
I
heard
a
voice
in
my

that
said
"Kill"
I
had
no
other
choice
that
was
left
except
fill
My

He

He

I
said,
"Chill
If
you
want
me
to

then
I
will"
Now
this
will
probably
be
the
most
illest
shit
that
I've
ever
said
God
bless
the
dead
and
let
Biggie
possess
the
pencil
lead
They
called
me
a
sped
and
said
that
I
had
a
messed
up
head
'Cause
I
said,
"Motherfuck
school,"
and
instead
went
to
special
ed
Sippin'
Bacardi
and
lime
I
start
to
recollect
on
the
time
That
I
startled
my
mom
and
had
her
scared
to
death
Word
to
Method
Man
She
heard
some
Wu-Tang
coming
from
towards
the
patio
She
was
like,
"What
the
heck
was
that?"
She
went
to
check
on
the
noise
and
go
inspect
the
deck
Then
I
jumped
out
with
a
sword
and
yelled,
"Protect
your
neck"
Now
bow
to
the
Lord,
hold
up,
no,
better
yet,
kneel
Better
yet,
get
down
on
all
fours
and
take
a
vow
to
always
Rejoice
in
the
sound
of
my
voice,
but
you
don't
have
a
choice
Just
a
third
of
my
will
will
overpower
yours
Using
about
a
fourth
to
create
the
amount
of
force
It'll
take
to
knock
out
a
horse
like
a
tranq
full
of
Tylenol
Enter
my
house
of
horrors
with
a
thousand
floors
Got
a
crown
of
thorns,
but
it
won't
fit
around
the
horns
But
I'ma
keep
it
a
buck
like
a
dollar
store
I'm
more
than
you
bargained
for
and
I
am
far
more
worse
Than
a
forty-some
bar
Lord
Jamar
verse
Nothing
means
more
than
respect,
so
when
I
curse
You
could
say
I
swore
to
protect
My
image,
I
have
zero
time
or
regard
for
A
never-was,
been
claiming
rap
when
it's
not
yours
If
it
was
anyone's
house,
G
Rap
and
Rakim
would
be
havin'
you
mop
floors
Run-DMC
would
be
havin'
you
cleanin'
sinks
Yeah,
your
group
was
off
the
chain,
but
you
were
the
weakest
link
Rest
of
these
youngins
of
mine
Time
to
start
throwing
some
shade,
this
time
I'm
shutting
the
blinds
'Cause
when
I'm
looking
at
y'all,
shit,
it's
no
wonder
it's
why
I
need
a
visor,
'cause
y'all
are
just
sons
in
my
eyes
Born
a
cynic
and
more
demented
than
an
orphanage
with
a
morgue
up
in
it
Next
door
to
an
abortion
clinic
Newborn
infants
tortured
and
tormented
With
their
foreheads
dented
when
they
drop
'cause
the
floor's
cemented
Their
corpses
get
ornamented
The
coroner
with
a
storage
bin
rented
To
store
them
in
and
the
torsos
of
forty
women
reported
missin'
Distorted,
twisted,
this
isn't
no
storybook
ending
This
is
only
the
beginning
So,
Lord,
forgive
me,
I'm
hearing
voices
I
can't
ignore
them
anymore,
they're
winning
I
thought
I
heard
a
voice
in
my
head
that
said
"Kill"
I
had
no
other
choice
that
was
left
except
fill
My
pencil
full
of
poisonous
lead,
the
devil
He
wants
me
to
murder
this
beat,
so
I
will
He
told
me
there
are
doubters
who
question
my
skill
They
wanna
put
my
style
to
the
test,
am
I
still
The
best?
They
want
the
crown
on
my
head,
I
said,
"Chill
If
you
want
me
to
murder
this
beat,
then
I
will"
And
I
don't
think
that
I
can
stop
it
(Here
it
comes)
I
do
my
best
to
try
to
block
it
(Redrum)
I've
been
sipping
on
like,
vodka
(Head's
numb)
I'm
blacking
out,
you
better
watch
it
(It's
bedlam)
This
concludes
our
danse
macabre
Portions
of
the
proceeding
were
recorded
As
for
the
rest
of
it,
I'm
very
much
afraid
it
was
all
in
your
mind
I
don't
intend
to
indulge
in
any
post-mortem
If
you
haven't
been
murdered,
I
can
only
say
Better
luck
next
time
If
you
have
been,
goodnight
wherever
you
are
*Plane
crash*
Yeah
(Illa,
Illa,
Illa)
Yo,
I'm
just
gonna
write
down
my
first
thoughts,
and
see
where
this
takes
me,
’cause
I
feel
like
I
wanna
punch
the
world
in
the
fuckin'
face
right
now
Yeah
Let
me
explain
just
how
to
make
greatness
Straight
out
the
gate,
I'm
’bout
to
break
it
down
Ain't
no
mistakes
allowed,
but
make
no
mistake,
I'm
'bout
To
rape
the
alphabet,
I
may
raise
some
brows
If
I
press
the
issue
just
to
get
the
anger
out
(Brrr!)
Full
magazine
could
take
Staples
out
Savage
but
ain't
thinkin'
'bout
no
bank
account
But
bitch,
I'm
off
the
chain
like
Kala
Brown
Motherfucker,
shut
the
fuck
up
when
I’m
talkin’,
lil'
bitch
I’m
sorry,
wait,
what's
your
talent?
Oh,
critiquin'
My
talent?
Oh,
bitch,
I
don't
know
who
the
fuck
y’all
are
To
give
a
sub-par
bar
or
even
have
an
opinion
or
view
You
mention
me,
millions
of
views,
attention
in
news
I
mention
you,
lose-lose
for
me,
win-win
for
you
Billions
of
views,
your
ten
cents
are
two
Skim
through
the
music
to
give
shit
reviews
To
get
clicks,
but
bitch,
you
just
lit
the
fuse
Don't
get
misconstrued,
business
as
us'
Shit-list
renewed,
so
get
shit
to
do
Or
get
dissed
'cause
I
just
don't
get
What
the
fuck
half
the
shit
is
that
you're
listenin'
to
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
I
hate
this
choppy
flow
Everyone
copies
though?
Prob'ly
no
Get
this
fuckin'
audio
out
my
Audi,
yo,
adiós
I
can
see
why
people
like
Lil
Yachty,
but
not
me
though
Not
even
dissin',
it
just
ain't
for
me
All
I
am
simply
is
just
an
emcee
Maybe
"Stan"
just
isn't
your
cup
of
tea
(Get
it?)
Maybe
your
cup's
full
of
syrup
and
lean
Maybe
I
need
to
stir
up
shit,
preferably
Shake
the
world
up
if
it
were
up
to
me
Paul
wants
me
to
chill,
y'all
want
me
to
ill
I
should
eat
a
pill,
probably
I
will
Old
me
killed
the
new
me,
watch
him
bleed
to
death
I
breathe
on
the
mirror,
I
don't
see
my
breath
Possibly
I'm
dead,
I
must
be
possessed
Like
an
evil
spell,
I'm
E-V-I-L
("Evil"
spelled)
Jam
a
Crest
Whitestrip
in
the
tip
of
my
dick
With
an
ice
pick,
stick
it
in
a
vise
grip
Hang
it
on
a
spike
fence,
bang
it
with
a
pipe
wrench
While
I
take
my
ball
sack
and
flick
it
like
a
light
switch
Like
Vice
President
Mike
Pence
Back
up
on
my
shit
in
a
sidekick
as
I
lay
it
on
a
spike
strip
These
are
things
that
I'd
rather
do
than
hear
you
on
a
mic
Since
nine
tenths
of
your
rhyme
is
about
ice
and
Jesus
Christ,
man,
how
many
times
is
Someone
gonna
fuck
on
my
bitch?
(Fuck
my
side
chick!)
You
won't
ever
see
Em
icy
But
as
cold
as
I
get
on
the
M-I-C
I
polarize
shit,
so
the
Thames
might
freeze
And
your
skull
might
split
like
I
bashed
you
upside
it
Bitch,
I
got
the
club
on
smash
like
a
nightstick
(Yeah)
Turn
down
for
what?
I
ain't
loud
enough,
nah,
turn
the
Valium
up
(Illa,
Illa,
Illa)
'Cause
I
don't
know
how
I'm
gonna
get
your
mouths
to
shut
Now
when
it
doesn't
matter
what
caliber
I
spit
at,
I'll
bet
a
hundred
thousand
bucks
You'll
turn
around
and
just
be
like,
"Man,
how
the
fuck
Sourpuss
gonna
get
mad
just
'cause
his
album
sucks?
And
now
he
wants
to
take
it
out
on
us"
(Ooouuu)
But
last
week,
an
ex-fan
mailed
me
a
copy
Of
The
Mathers
LP
to
tell
me
to
study
It'll
help
me
get
back
to
myself
and
she'll
love
me
(Ooouuu)
I
mailed
the
bitch
back
and
said
if
I
did
that
I'd
just
be
like
everyone
else
in
the
fucking
industry
Especially
an
effing
Recovery
clone
of
me
(NFing)
So
finger-bang,
chicken
wang,
MGK,
Igg'
Azae'
Lil
Pump,
Lil
Xan
imitate
Lil
Wayne
I
should
aim
at
everybody
in
the
game,
pick
a
name
I'm
fed
up
with
bein'
humble
And
rumor
is
I'm
hungry,
I'm
sure
you
heard
rumblings
I
heard
you
wanna
rumble
like
an
empty
stomach
I
heard
your
mumblin'
but
it's
jumbled
in
mumbo-jumbo
The
era
that
I'm
from
will
pummel
you,
that's
what
it's
comin'
to
What
the
fuck
you're
gonna
do
when
you
run
into
it?
I'm
gonna
crumble
you
and
I'll
take
a
number
two
And
dump
on
you,
if
you
ain't
Joyner
If
you
ain't
Kendrick
or
Cole
or
Sean,
then
you're
a
goner
I'm
'bout
to
bring
it
to
anyone
in
this
bitch
who
want
it
I
guess
when
you
walk
into
BK
you
expect
a
Whopper
You
can
order
a
Quarter
Pounder
when
you
go
to
McDonald's
But
if
you're
lookin'
to
get
a
porterhouse
you
better
go
get
Revival
But
y'all
are
actin'
like
I
tried
to
serve
you
up
a
slider
Maybe
the
vocals
shoulda
been
auto-tuned
And
you
woulda
bought
it
But
sayin'
I
no
longer
got
it
'Cause
you
missed
a
line
and
never
caught
it
'Cause
it
went
over
your
head,
because
you're
too
stupid
to
get
it
'Cause
you're
mentally
retarded,
but
pretend
to
be
the
smartest
With
your
expertise
and
knowledge,
but
you'll
never
be
an
artist
And
I'm
harder
on
myself
than
you
could
ever
be
regardless
What
I'll
never
be
is
flawless,
all
I'll
ever
be
is
honest
(Illa,
Illa,
Illa)
Even
when
I'm
gone
they're
gonna
say
I
brought
it
Even
when
I
hit
my
forties
like
a
fuckin'
alcoholic
With
a
bottle
full
of
malt
liquor
But
I
couldn't
bottle
this
shit
any
longer
The
fact
that
I
know
that
I'ma
hit
my
bottom
If
I
don't
pull
myself
from
the
jaws
of
defeat
and
rise
to
my
feet
I
don't
see
why
y'all
even
started
with
me
I
get
in
beefs,
my
enemies
die
I
don't
cease
fire
'til
at
least
all
are
deceased
I'm
east
side,
never
be
caught
slippin'
Now
you
see
why
I
don't
sleep,
not
even
a
wink,
I
don't
blink
I
don't
doze
off,
I
don't
even
nod
to
the
beats
I
don't
even
close
my
fuckin'
eyes
when
I
sneeze
"Aw,
man!
That
BET
cypher
was
weak,
it
was
garbage
The
Thing
ain't
even
orange—oh
my
God,
that's
a
reach!"
Shout
to
all
my
colorblind
people
Each
and
everyone
of
y'all,
if
you
call
a
fire
engine
green
Aquamarine,
or
you
think
water
is
pink
"Dawg,
that's
a
date."
—
"Looks
like
an
olive
to
me."
"Look,
there's
an
apple!"
—
"No,
it's
not,
it's
a
peach!"
So
finger-bang,
Pootie
Tang
Burger
King,
Gucci
Gang,
dookie,
dang
Charlamagne
gonna
hate
anyway,
doesn't
matter
what
I
say
Give
me
Donkey
of
the
Day
What
a
way
for
2018
to
get
underway
But
I'm
gonna
say
everything
that
I
wanna
say
Welcome
to
the
slaughterhouse,
bitch!
(Yeah)
Invite
'em
in
like
a
One
A
Day
I'm
not
done
(Preach!)
'Cause
I
feel
like
the
beast
of
burden
That
line
in
the
sand,
was
it
even
worth
it?
'Cause
the
way
I
see
people
turning's
Makin'
it
seem
worthless,
it's
startin'
to
defeat
the
purpose
I'm
watchin'
my
fan
base
shrink
to
thirds
And
I
was
just
tryin'
to
do
the
right
thing,
but
word
Has
the
court
of
public
opinion
reached
a
verdict
Or
still
yet
to
be
determined?
'Cause
I'm
determined
to
be
me,
critiqued
or
worshipped
But
if
I
could
go
back,
I'd
at
least
reword
it
And
say
I
empathize
with
the
people
this
evil
serpent
Sold
the
dream
to
that
he's
deserted
But
I
think
it's
workin'
These
verses
are
makin'
him
a
wee
bit
nervous
And
he's
too
scurred
to
answer
me
with
words
'Cause
he
knows
that
he
will
lyrically
get
murdered
But
I
know
at
least
he's
heard
it
'Cause
Agent
Orange
just
sent
the
Secret
Service
To
meet
in
person
to
see
if
I
really
think
of
hurtin'
him
Or
ask
if
I'm
linked
to
terrorists
I
said,
"Only
when
it
comes
to
ink
and
lyricists."
But
my
beef
is
more
media
journalists
(Hold
up,
hold
up,
hold
up)
I
said,
my
beef
is
more
meaty,
a
journalist
Can
get
a
mouthful
of
flesh
And
yes,
I
mean
eating
a
penis
'Cause
they've
been
pannin'
my
album
to
death
So
I've
been
givin'
the
media
fingers
Don't
wanna
turn
this
to
a
counseling
sesh
But
they've
been
puttin'
me
through
the
ringer
So
I
ain't
ironin'
shit
out
with
the
press
But
I
just
took
this
beat
to
the
cleaners
Motherfuckers
talkin'
crazy
(Yeah)
Sayin’
I
should
quit
(Ah)
I
fuckin'
tell
'em
make
me
(Bitch)
Eat
a
fuckin’
dick
(Yeah)
I'm
feelin'
like
the
greatest
(Woo!)
On
the
beat
who
ever
did
it
Mike
WiLL
the
one
who
made
it
It's
Shady
on
the
lyrics
I'm
somewhat
outlandish
they
say
You
say
we're
cut
from
the
same
cloth
But
I
guess
you
fabricate,
eh?
You
better
bring
more
men
than
the
Latter
Day
Saints
Manic
states,
Stephen
Paddock
with
automatic
stay
sprayin'
At
anything
that
may
stand
in
they
way
As
I
stand
at
the
bay
window
with
a
hand
grenade
And
a
trey
eight,
at
the
Mandalay
Bay
Common
sense,
I'm
a
dollar
short
and
a
day
late
James
Holmes
at
the
Saturday
Batman
matinee
Must
have
missed
my
CAT
scan
that
day
(Yeah!)
I
just
threw
a
Tampax
at
Dre
Trashcan,
Tascam
and
ashtray
I’m
turnin’
back
to
a
madman,
can't
take
Anymore
but
I
try
to
get
away
from
the
anger
and
rage
My
basal
ganglia’s
an
A
to
the
K
Get
your
ass
sprayed
like
bidets
Breakin'
your
legs
eight
different
ways,
ankle
to
waist
You
chumps
don't
even
know
how
to
do
somethin'
To
give
goosebumps
a
day
when
you
say
That
somethin’
you
wrote
gave
someone
a
lump
in
their
throat
Or
you
had
them
choked
up,
you'd
be
yankin'
my
chain
(Ayy)
Feelin'
like
I'm
headed
for
the
padded
cell,
the
Bar
for
me
when
I
rap
isn't
fair
but
Guess
that's
the
standard
I'm
held
to
But
if
somethin'
like
that
doesn't
tell
ya
You
set
a
mark
too
high
when
platinum
sales
are
Looked
at
as
a
failure
(Yeah)
Then
you
better
take
it
back
to
The
Shelter
and
Hamburger
Helper
'Cause
damn
it
I'm
still
the
Greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world
No
lie,
I
might
be
The
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever
do
it
I
feel
like
the
greatest
Woke
up
to
honkies
sounding
like
me
Never
be
as
good,
never
be
as
good
Packing
up
wife-beaters,
white
t-shirts,
white
But
I'm
the
greatest
So
you
sold
10
million
albums,
eh?
(What?)
Only
problem
is,
you
put
out
10
million
albums,
eh?
(Haha)
Wait,
what
was
I
just
about
to
say?
Oh
yeah,
let
me
get
this
out
the
way
I
know
there's
people
that
are
pissed
about
the
way
I
mispronounced
a
name,
"DIE
ANTWOORD!"
Fuck,
I
still
can't
say
this
shit,
but
how
quickly
they
forget
Who
the
fuck
I
was;
now
Ninja
try
to
duck
my
slugs
You
let
ya
girl
get
fucked
by
Muggs
I'd
like
to
give
a
shout
to
Cypress
(Woo!)
This
can't
be
real,
you
dissed
me
and
I
was
just
tryin'
to
Give
you
a
shout—now
get
the
fuck
out
my
rhyme
book!
No
more
shiners,
already
too
much
time
tokin'
rappers
I
hear
you
talkin'
shit,
I'm
just
too
big
to
respond
to
it
God
forbid
I
forget,
go
and
jump
out
the
window
Somebody
better
child-proof
it
'Cause
if
I
lose
it
we
can
rewind
to
some
old
Ja
Rule
shit
And
I
can
remind
motherfuckers
how
I
do
shit
You
don't
got
the
tools
I
got
in
my
toolkit
(Bitch!)
I
bullshit
you
not,
y'all
fools
just
forgot
That
I'm
so
fuckin'
awful
with
the
thoughts
And
when
I'm
hostile
and
impossible
to
stop
So
you
can
call
it
a
nostril
'cause
it's-snot
gonna
ever
I'll
never
let
up
on
the
pedal,
might
as
well
get
the
mop
'Cause
I'm
wipin'
up
everyone
in
this
genre
'Cause
on
the
mic
I
feel
like
I'm
the
Greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world
No
lie,
I
might
be
The
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever
do
it
I
feel
like
the
greatest
Woke
up
to
honkies
sounding
like
me
Never
be
as
good,
never
be
as
good
Packing
up
wife-beaters,
white
t-shirts,
white
But
I'm
the
greatest
Oh
yeah,
and
one
more
thing
I
want
to
mention
(What?)
Is
you're
one
dimension
I'm
a
monkey
wrench
and
I
can
flunk
detention
I
love
contentions,
so
welcome
to
the
gun
convention
Muscles
flexin',
gotta
strut
like
a
front
suspension
And
you
just
stuck
the
key
up
in
the
ignition
And
gave
me
enough
gas
to
flood
my
engine
(Yeah)
Psychopath,
Michael's
Jack's
blowin'
up
like
a
raft
I
should
slap
Vlad
with
a
ISIS
flag
Bet
you
I
come
back
twice
as
bad
(Uh)
Revival
didn't
go
viral!
Denaun
and
Royce
tell
me
that
I
should
take
the
high
road
Fuck
that,
I'm
finna
hit
back
'Til
I
run
out
of
gunpowder
and
split
the
scene
Hold
the
mic
similar
to
pistol,
squeeze
And
I
shoot
from
the
hip
when
I
grip
them
things
And
my
lips
are
the
clips
got
the
sig
lit
like
it's
nicotine
Trigger
me
and
Slim
gets
mean
(Prr!)
Bars
are
like
bullets
when
I
spit
them
schemes
That's
why
I
call
the
motherfuckers
M16s
(woo!)
Float
like
a
butterfly,
I'm
gonna
sting
like
a
bee
You
ain't
harmin'
a
thing
I
hit
a
ding
hard
as
I'm
gonna
swing
I'm
gonna
need
to
put
my
arm
in
a
sling
But
like
a
wedding
band
You
gotta
be
diamond
to
even
climb
in
the
ring
And
nominally
I'm
Muhammad
Ali
'Cause
I
knew
one
day
I'm
gonna
be
the
Greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world
No
lie,
I
might
be
The
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever
do
it
I
feel
like
the
greatest
Woke
up
to
honkies
sounding
like
me
Never
be
as
good,
never
be
as
good
Packing
up
wife-beaters,
white
t-shirts,
white
But
I'm
the
greatest
Woah,
Joyner,
Joyner,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
Yeah,
I
done
did
a
lot
of
things
in
my
day,
I
admit
it
I
don't
take
back
what
I
say,
if
I
said
it
then
I
meant
it
All
my
life
I
want
a
Grammy,
but
I'll
prolly
never
get
it
I
ain't
never
had
no
trophy
or
no
motherfuckin'
ribbon
(Yah
I
said
it)
Fuck
the
system,
I'm
that
nigga,
bend
the
law,
cut
the
rules
I'm
about
to
risk
it
all,
I
ain't
got
too
much
to
lose
Y'all
been
eatin'
long
enough,
it's
my
turn
to
cut
the
food
Pass
the
plate!
Where
my
drink?
This
my
day,
lucky
you
Fuck
you
too,
woo!
Y'all
gotta
move,
y'all
gotta
move,
y'all
gotta
move
Give
me
some
room,
give
me
some
room,
give
me
the
juice
Hop
out
the
coupe,
hop
out
the
coupe,
hop
out
and
shoot
Y'all
gotta
move,
y'all
gotta
move,
give
me
the
juice
Back
on
my
bullshit,
my
back
to
the
wall
Turn
my
back
on
you,
all
of
you
finished
Back
to
these
bullets,
it's
back
to
the
job
Pull
my
MAC
out
and
all
of
you
runnin'
Back
on
my
hood
shit,
it's
back
to
the
pushin'
These
packs
and
I'm
actually
pumpin'
Can't
fuck
with
you
rappers,
you
practically
suckin'
You
mighta
went
platinum
but
that
don't
mean
nothin'
I'm
actually
buzzin'
this
time
Straight
out
the
kitchen,
I
told
'em
the
oven
is
mine
I
do
not
fuck
with
you
guys
If
I
don't
kill
you,
just
know
you
gon'
suffer
this
time
I
ain't
no
gangster
but
I
got
some
bangers
Some
chains
and
some
blades
and
a
couple
of
nines
Choppers
and
jammies,
a
partridge,
a
pear
tree
My
12
days
of
Christmas
was
nothin'
but
lies
(I)
Run
at
you
hard
like
a
sumo
(Sumo)
They
say
I
talk
like
a
chulo
(Chulo)
I
live
in
Mars,
I'm
not
Bruno
(Woo)
Bitch
I'm
a
dog,
call
me
Cujo
(Rah)
You
play
your
cards,
I
reverse
on
you
all
And
I
might
just
draw
4
like
a
Uno
(Bup)
Cállate
boca
mejor,
maricón,
little
puto,
and
all
of
you
culo
(Joyner)
They've
invented
a
level
up
in
the
ghetto
to
get
old
Lookin'
for
somethin'
I
prolly
can
never
find
now
Shit
get
relevant
'til
'nother
beef
die
down
In
truth,
a
nigga
just
really
want
me
tied
down
I've
been
alone
and
I
never
needed
nobody
Just
only
me
and
my
shotty,
I'll
tell
these
niggas
to
lie
down
Keep
all
the
money,
I
never
wanted
the
lifestyle
I
just
pray
to
God
that
my
son'll
be
alright
now
I
said
ain't
no
love
for
the
other
side
Or
anyone
who
ever
want
smoke
(Joyner)
When
I
die
I'm
goin'
out
as
the
underdog
who
never
lost
hope
(Yeah)
You
in
the
wrong
cab
down
the
wrong
path
Nigga,
wrong
way,
wrong
road
(Woo,
woo)
Snakes
in
the
grass
tryna
slither
fast
I
just
bought
a
fuckin'
lawn
mower
(Vroom!)
I
done
said
a
lotta
things
in
my
day,
I
admit
it
This
is
payback
in
a
way,
I
regret
it
that
I
did
it
I
done
won
a
couple
Grammys,
but
I
sold
my
soul
to
get
'em
Wasn't
in
it
for
the
trophies,
just
the
fuckin'
recognition
Fuck's
the
difference?
I'm
that
cracker,
bend
the
law,
fuck
the
rules
Man,
I
used
to
risk
it
all,
now
I
got
too
much
to
lose
I've
been
eatin'
long
enough,
man,
my
stomach
should
be
full
I
just
ate,
licked
the
plate,
my
buffet,
lucky
me
Fuck
you
think?
(Woo!)
I
got
a
couple
of
mansions
Still
I
don't
have
any
manners
You
got
a
couple
of
ghost
writers
But
to
these
kids
it
don't
actually
matter
They're
askin'
me,
"What
the
fuck
happened
to
hip-hop?"
I
said,
"I
don't
have
any
answers."
'Cause
I
took
an
L
when
I
dropped
my
last
album
It
hurt
me
like
hell
but
I'm
back
on
these
rappers
And
actually
comin'
from
humble
beginnings
I'm
somewhat
uncomfortable
winning
I
wish
I
could
say,
"What
a
wonderful
feeling!"
"We're
on
the
upswing
like
we're
punchin'
the
ceiling!"
But
nothin'
is
feeling
like
anyone
has
any
fuckin'
ability
To
even
stick
to
a
subject,
it's
killin'
me
The
inability
to
pen
humility
Ha-ta-ta
ba-ta-ta,
why
don't
we
make
a
bunch
of
Fuckin'
songs
about
nothin'
and
mumble
'em?
Fuck
it,
I'm
goin'
for
the
jugular
Shit
is
a
circus,
you
clowns
that
are
comin'
up
Don't
give
an
ounce
of
a
motherfuck
About
the
ones
that
were
here
before
you
that
made
rap
Let's
recap,
way
back,
MC's
that
wreak
havoc
on
tape
decks
ADAT's,
where
the
G
Raps
and
Kanes
at?
We
need
3
Stacks
ASAP
and
bring
Masta
Ace
back
'Cause
half
of
these
rappers
have
brain
damage
All
the
lean
rappin',
face
tats,
syruped
out
like
tree
sap
I
don't
hate
trap,
and
I
don't
wanna
seem
mad
But
in
fact,
where
the
old
me
at?
The
same
cat
That
would
take
that
feedback
and
aim
back,
I
need
that
But
I
think
it's
inevitable
They
know
what
button
to
press
or
what
lever
to
pull
To
get
me
to
snap
though
(Lil'
bitch)
And
if
I
pay
it
attention
I'm
prob'ly
makin'
it
bigger
But
you've
been
takin'
ya
digs
in
the
fuckin'
back,
ho
(Get
it?)
On
the
brink,
any
minute
got
me
thinkin'
of
finishin'
Everything
with
acetaminophen
and
reapin'
the
benefits
I'm
asleep
at
the
wheel
again
As
I
peak
into
thinkin'
about
an
evil
intent
Of
another
beat
I'ma
kill
again
'Cause
even
if
I
gotta
end
up
eatin'
a
pill
again
Even
ketamine
or
methamphetamine
with
the
minithin
It
better
be
at
least
70
or
300
milligram
And
I
might
as
well
'cause
I'ma
end
up
bein'
a
villain
again
Levels
to
this
shit,
I
got
an
elevator
You
could
never
say
to
me
I'm
not
a
fuckin'
record
breaker
I
sound
like
a
broken
record
every
time
I
break
a
record
Nobody
could
ever
take
away
the
legacy
I
made,
I
never
cater
Motherfucker,
now
I
got
a
right
to
be
this
way
I
got
spite
inside
my
DNA
But
I
wrote
'til
the
wheels
fall
off,
I'm
workin'
tirelessly,
ayy
It's
the
moment
y'all
been
waitin'
for
Like
California
wishin'
rain
to
pour
In
that
drought,
y'all
been
prayin'
for
My
downfall
from
the
8
Mile
to
the
Southpaw
Still
the
same
Marshall,
that
outlaw
That
they
say
as
a
writer
might've
fell
off
I'm
back
on
that
bull
like
the
cowboy
So
y'all
gotta
move
(Yeah),
y'all
gotta
move
(Yeah),
y'all
gotta
move
Give
me
some
room,
give
me
some
room,
give
me
the
juice
Hop
out
the
coupe,
hop
out
the
coupe,
hop
out
and
shoot
Y'all
gotta
move,
y'all
gotta
move,
give
me
the
juice
Hey
Em,
It's
Paul.
Umm,
I
listened
to
the
new
album.
Umm,
are
you
really
gonna
just
reply
to
everybody
who
you
don't
like
what
they
have
to
say,
uh,
about
you
or
the
stuff
you're
working
on?
I
mean,
I
don't
know
if
that's
really
a
great
idea,
it's-it's
like,
what's
next?
Kamikaze
2,
the
album
where
you
reply
to
everybody
who
didn't
like
the
album
that
you
made
replying
to
everybody
that
didn't
like
the
previous
album?
It's
a
slippery
slope.
I-I
don't
know
if
it's
a
really
good
idea.
Umm,
anyway,
hit
me
back.
(Illa,
Illa,
Illa)
Yo,
how
do
I
keep
(Man,
I
don't
know
what’s
up
with
these
hoes,
man)
Gettin'
in
relationships
like
this?
(I'm
just
sayin’)
Maybe
it
says
somethin'
about
me
(Yeah,
yup)
Should
I
look
in
the
mirror?
I
just
want
you
to
be
normal
Why
can't
you
bitches
be
normal?
Always
gotta
be
so
extra
Why
you
always
need
a
lecture?
My
ex
hates
to
talk,
she's
a
texter
Even
when
I'm
in
bed
layin'
right
next
to
her
Wants
to
get
back
together
Said
not
'til
she
gets
her
act
together
She
thinks
I'm
bein’
mean
and
now
She
starts
to
scream
and
shout
She’s
about
to
let
the
demons
out
She
don't
wanna
see
me
with
other
females
out
I
tell
the
bitch
to
beat
it,
take
the
scenic
route
She
retaliates
by
tryin’
to
leave
the
house
In
an
evening
gown
with
her
cleavage
out
We've
been
down
this
road
too
many
times
for
me
to
count
And
all
I
can
think
is
how—
I
just
want
you
to
be
normal
Why
can't
you
bitches
be
normal?
Always
gotta
be
so
extra
Like
a
fuckin'
terrestrial
I
guess
it
comes
with
the
territory
My
ex
girl,
she
just
declared
war
Therefore,
I
better
prepare
for
it
I
guess
bein’
weird's
normal
And
I
don't
know
what's
got
a
hold
of
me
Most
notably
I've
been
zonin'
to
Jodeci
I'm
totally
open,
hopelessly
devoted
So
much
so
that
I
bet
you
she
don't
even
know
that
she's
The
first
thing
I
think
of
when
I
wake
up
And
the
last
thing
I
think
of
'fore
I
go
to
sleep
Sike,
hope
she
don't
notice
me
goin'
through
her
purse
I
know
she
cheats,
so
do
I,
I'm
soulless,
she's
heartless
No
wonder
we're
partners
Both
got
hundreds
of
charges
Domestic
disputes
but
we've
always
Swept
it
under
the
carpet
Even
when
911
gets
the
call
that
I
slipped
up
and
busted
her
jaw
with
A
Louisville
Slugger
'cause
alls
it
Really
does
is
make
our
love
For
each
other
grow
stronger
She
won
me
over
the
second
she
tried
to
run
me
over
Told
her
I'd
keep
it
a
hun',
we
over
Kicked
her
out,
called
her
back,
now
she's
coming
over
But
why
is
she
so
wicked?
And
how
the
fuck
did
I
get
so
twisted
Up
with
someone
so
unlikable
and
shifty
We're
like
nitrogen
and
hydrogen
mixed
with
Ignitable
liquids,
but
I'm
finally
seeing
She's
only
mine
for
the
time
being
That's
why
I
keep
bringin'
up
that
one
time
she
Tried
to
two-time
me
And
throw
it
up
in
her
face
'til
I
dry
heave
How
could
I
be
so
naive?
Should
I
leave
or
turn
this
entire
evening
Into
a
motherfucking
crime
scene?
Maybe
I'm
just
too
ugly
to
compete
with
him
You
weren't
s'posed
to
agree,
you
fucking
bitch!
'Specially
when
you're
the
one
cheated
first
Now
the
argument
immediately
becomes
heated
You
don't
want
me
to
flip,
little
conceited
cunt
Eat
a
monkey
dick
wrapped
in
a
stuffed
pita
fajita
Slut,
treat
it
just
like
a
drum,
beat
it
Complete
it,
and
once
you've
succeeded,
repeat
it!
I
love
you
but
I
hope
you
fuckin'
die
though
In
our
business
your
friends
like
to
pry
so
You've
got
'em
all
under
cover
just
like
moles
Hopin'
they'll
come
back
with
intel
But
I'm
the
one
who's
thrown
into
the
spiral
'Cause
now
the
roles
are
reversed
so
here
I
go
Thinkin'
I'm
sly
as
I
scroll
through
your
iPhone
Who
the
fuck's
Milo?
The
guy
at
work
who
drives
a
hi-lo
I
put
a
tracking
device
on
your
Chrysler
And
follow
you
while
you
drive
home
But
like
a
cyclone,
I
just
got
my
disguise
blown
You
recognize
me
and
had
Milo
flip
me
off
Right
out
the
passenger
side
window
(*Beep-beep*)
I
hit
a
light
pole,
you
skirt
off
And
then
pull
up
at
5
a.m.
in
the
drive
in
a
stretched
white
limo
Stumble
in
the
side
door
and
hit
me
in
the
head
with
Milo's
demo
But
like
a
drunk
bum,
what
do
I
know?
Let's
sleep
on
it
like
they
did
Revival
I
told
you
you're
the
apple
of
my
eye,
so
shut
your
pie
hole
Just
wanna
be
normal
Why
can't
you
be
normal?
(Yeah)
I
just
wanna
be
normal
Why
can't
you
be
normal?
Paul,
yo,
um
So
I
got
your
message,
I
wish
you
would
answer
the
fuckin'
phone
Um...
(Turn
right)
No,
I
don't
plan
to
reply
to
everybody
who
fuckin'
says
something
fucked
up
about
me
But
I
will
say
this,
I
was
reading
some
comments
last
night
about,
like
(Turn
right),
what
people
are
fuckin'
saying
about
Revival
And
uhh
Yo,
this
Yahoo
motherfucker,
whatever
the
fuck
his
name
is,
said
I
rhy—literally
said
I
rhymed
"rhymes"
with
"chimes"
"Sucker
free,
confidence
high
Such
a
breeze
when
I
pen
rhymes"
(Turn
right)
Like,
you
don't
understand
I'm
rhyming
the
entire
fuckin'
sentence
you
fuckin'
moron
(In
100
feet,
turn
left)
It's
my
fault
'cause
you're
fuckin'
stupid
But
I
swear
to
God
this
motherfucker
lives
in
Michigan
and
I
think
I
figured
out
his
address
And
I'm
on
my
way
to
his
fuckin'
house
right
now
(Turn
left)
I'll
hit
you
back
later
Take
me
to
the
river
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
It's
2002,
everything
was
totally
new
We
were
globally
huge,
watchin'
sales
go
through
the
roof
We
wrote
and
we
feuded,
Runyon
Avenue
soldiers
included
A
multitude
of
homies
who
would
bounce
for
no
good
excuse
We
were
so
bulletproof—wrote,
souped
and
soaked
in
our
youth
Thought
we
was
runnin'
shit
'til
we
lost
the
sole
of
our
shoe
The
death
of
Doody
broke
us
in
two
We
were
thrown
for
a
loop,
ain't
none
of
us
know
what
to
do
And
at
the
time
I
was
goin'
through
my
own
struggles
too
So
I
wasn't
in
no
condition
to
be
coachin'
us
through
Everyone
tried
to
go
solo,
really
nobody
blew
I
was
hopin'
they
do,
so
I
ain't
have
to
shoulder
the
crew
The
plan
was
put
everyone
in
position
so
that
they
knew
How
to
stand
on
their
own,
and
I
don't
wanna
open
up
wounds
I
just
noticed
that
oomph
was
gone
when
we
go
in
the
booth
'Cause
the
truth
is,
the
moment
that
Proof
died,
so
did
the
group
Shoot!
If
I
could
leave
this
all
behind
I
could
open
up
my
eyes
and
walk
in
a
straight
line
Down
to
the
river
with
you
Help
me
leave
this
all
behind
I'ma
wash
away
my
sins
I'ma
rinse
away
this
dirt
I
forgot
to
make
amends
To
all
the
friends
I
may
have
hurt
I
better
stop
and
say
my
grace
From
it
I
pray
that
I
don't
fall
'Cause
on
the
way
back
down
I
may
End
up
runnin'
back
into
them
all
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
as
my
stepping
stones
It
was
never
the
same,
and
it's
bothered
me
since
And
the
farther
we
drift
apart,
the
more
awkward
it
gets
The
more
time
goes
by,
the
more
life
happens
And
we
gotta
be
men,
we
got
responsibilities
Plus
we
don't
say
how
we
feel
And
I
feel
like
this
is
what
got
us
in
the
debacle
we're
in
Been
with
you
guys
thick
and
thin
But
it's
almost
as
if
sometimes
we're
not
even
friends
Which
reminded
me,
Biz,
"Rockstar"
was
the
shit
Y'all
coulda
got
you
a
hit
without
me
on
the
shit
If
you
woulda
put
D12
on
it,
wish
I
coulda
did
More
than
try
talkin'
you
into
comin'
up
off
of
it
I
know
it
wasn't
my
fault,
but
part
of
it
probably
is
I
think
of
all
of
the
trips
to
BET
And
the
rappers
I
wish
that
we
woulda
politicked
with
Maybe
y'all
coulda
clicked
and
got
you
some
features
But
that's
water
under
the
bridge
But
I'm
washin'
my
sins
in
it
'til
my
conscience
is
cleansed
If
I
could
leave
this
all
behind
I
could
open
up
my
eyes
and
walk
in
a
straight
line
Down
to
the
river
with
you
Help
me
leave
this
all
behind
I'ma
wash
away
my
sins
I'ma
rinse
away
this
dirt
I
forgot
to
make
amends
To
all
the
friends
I
may
have
hurt
I
better
stop
and
say
my
grace
From
it
I
pray
that
I
don't
fall
'Cause
on
the
way
back
down
I
may
End
up
runnin'
back
into
them
all
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
as
my
stepping
stones
Bacardi
and
Hen',
never
thought
the
party
would
end
One
minute
you're
bodyin'
shit,
but
then
your
audience
splits
You
can
already
sense
the
climate
is
startin'
to
shift
To
these
kids
you
no
longer
exist
Went
from
rainin'
cats
and
dogs
in
this
bitch
To
tiny
drops,
little
drips
And
by
the
time
your
reign
is
over,
you'll
hardly
be
missed
You
start
thinkin'
of
all
the
artists
you
dissed
All
the
carnage
you
left,
is
this
the
kind
of
karma
you
get
For
turnin'
your
fuckin'
back
on
Bizzy,
Kuniva
and
Swift?
A
Freudian
slip,
subconsciously,
I
honestly
wished
I
ain't
feel
so
much
guilt
and
y'all
didn't
harbor
resentment
But
it's
hard
to
pretend
that
y'all
ain't
got
none
I
just
wish
I
had
words,
but
I
guess
there
just
are
none
for
this
To
my
partners,
I
can't
say
how
sorry
I
am
This
is
not
how
I
planned
for
our
story
to
end
I
love
all
of
you
men
But
I
just
can't
be
the
guy
everybody
depends
On
for
entire
careers
'cause
that's
not
even
fair
I
will
always
be
here,
but
that
spark
isn't
there
And
I
don't
know
how
to
recapture
that
time
and
that
era
I've
tried
hearkening
back
to,
but
I'm
fightin'
for
air
I'm
barely
chartin'
myself
Feels
like
I'm
on
the
descent,
but
it
was
not
my
intent
To
treat
y'all
like
a
stepping
stone
Though
I
ain't
left
no
one
behind,
but
we
been
down
every
road
Done
all
we
possibly
can,
I
know
we
kept
our
hopes
up
But
the
longer
we
spend
livin'
this
lie
that
we
live
The
less
is
left
for
closure,
so
let's
let
this
go
It's
not
goodbye
to
our
friendship,
but
D12
is
over
I'ma
wash
away
my
sins
I'ma
rinse
away
this
dirt
I
forgot
to
make
amends
To
all
the
friends
I
may
have
hurt
I
better
stop
and
say
my
grace
From
it
I
pray
that
I
don't
fall
'Cause
on
the
way
back
down
I
may
End
up
runnin'
back
into
them
all
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
as
my
stepping
stones
I
never
meant
to
make
you
feel
like
my
stepping
stones
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
for
my
stepping
stones
Tay
Keith,
fuck
these
niggas

Yeah
Brain
dead,

Pain
meds,
cyclops
Daybed,
iPod
"May-back,"
Maybach
Trainwrecks,

Payless,

K-Fed,
iHop
Playtex,

That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
(Yah!)
That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
(Whoa!)
Up
on
this
mic
when
we're
on
it
(Yah)
That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
(Yuh!)
That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
(Woo!)
That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
We
are
not
alike,
there's
nada
like
us
on
the
mic
(Yah!)
I
don't
do
Jordans
and
Audemars
I
do
explosions
and
Molotovs
Y'all
blowin'
smoke
as
if
y'all
ain't
washed
I
blow
the
smoke
from
the
car
exhaust
Flyin'
to
a
party
I
am
not
invited
to,
feelin'
like
the
streets
need
me
I
ain't
gotta
dance
long
as
my
Ferrari
Spider
move
like
C
Breezy
I
don't
gotta
hire
goons
I'd
rather
try
to
buy
the
moon
and
breathe
freely
The
sky
is
blue,
the
tires
new
The
Maserati
white
and
cool
like
G-Eazy
Why
these
dudes
tryna
figure
out
How
to
do
a
freestyle
as
fly
as
me?
(Why?)
I'm
confused
tryna
figure
out
how
to
do
Kapri
Styles
and
Mya
G
Everybody
doin'
chick
joints
Probably
rob
these
little
dudes
at
fist
point
'Member
everybody
used
to
bite
Nickel
Now
everybody
doin'
Bitcoin
We
don't
got
nothin'
in
common
(No!)
We
don't
got
nothin'
in
common
(No!)
Y'all
into
stuff
like
doubled-up
Styrofoam
cups
On
them
uppers-and-downers
(Woo!)
I'm
into
stuff
like
doublin'
commas
Find
me
a
brother
who's
solid
To
count
the
shit
up
and
then
bust
the
shit
down
When
the
cops
hit
us
up,
we
can
flush
the
shit
down
We
cannot
give
a
fuck,
shit,
a
fuckin'
colonic
Sellin'
your
cock
and
your
butt
for
a
follower
Possible
couple
of
dollars,
you
powder
sniff
Now
you
slippin',
call
it
a
power
trip,
a
product
of
politics
Y'all
went
from
profit
and
toppin'
the
charts
To
dropped
in
the
park
in
a
pile
of
shit
Knowledge
is
power,
but
powerless
If
you've
got
it
and
you
do
not
acknowledge
it
Y'all
music
sound
like
Dr.
Seuss
inspired
it
Hirin'
strippers,
prostitutes
retirin'
We
can
spit
it
for
your
advance

That's

(Yah!)
That's
how

(Whoa!)
Up
on
this

when
we're

(Yah)
That's
how
much
we
have
in

(Yuh!)
That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
(Woo!)
That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
We
are
not
alike,
there's
nada
like
us—
You
say
you're
affiliated
with
murderers,
killers
(Ayy!)
The
people

run
with
are
thuggin'
(Gang!)
But

wannabe
gunner
(Gang!)
Like

somethin'
Actin'
like

(Ayy!)
And

You

Bitch,

Rap
God

(Pew!)
And
gats

This

not

with

But

for
sure,
you
better
put
a
Strap

other
words
if
you're
gonna
Roll

with
your

'Cause
this

So

arms
if
you're
gonna

(Skrrt!)
Oh,
you
run
the
streets,
huh?
Now
you
wanna
come
and
fuck
with
me,
huh?
This
little
cock-sucker,
he
must
be
feelin'
himself
He
wants
to
keep
up
his
tough
demeanour
So
he
does
a
feature,
decides
to
team
up
with
N9na
But
next
time
you
don't
gotta
use
Tech
N9ne
If
you
wanna
come
at
me
with
a
sub,
Machine
Gun
And
I'm
talkin'
to
you
But
you
already
know
who
the
fuck
you
are,
Kelly
I
don't
use
sublims
and
sure
as

don't
sneak-diss
But
keep
commenting
on
my
daughter
Hailie
I
keep
on
telling
motherfuckers
But
just
in
case
you
forgot
really
and
need
Ja
memories
jarred
like
strawberry
or
pineapple
apricot
jelly
I
respond
rarely,

Shady
'bout

Like

Let

Non-threatening

cornball
takin'

at
me
You're
not
ready,
fool,
break
yourself
like
Rock
Steady
Crew
Obviously,
I'm
not
getting
through
We
can
get
it
poppin'
like
Redenbach,
letting

like
Remy
Ma
Heavy

Godzilla
harsh
with
a
hard

With
a

bigger

Only

You'll
be

'bout
Fetty
Wap,
better
call

Just

OGs,
R.I.P.
Prodigy
Sold
Dre
my
soul
and
then
told
him
the
moment
he
signed
me
That
I'll
be
the
most
hated,
though
made
it
So
that
there's
no
shame,
it's
okay
to
own
it
'Cause
life
is
a
bitch,
she's
a
bow-legged

But
now
those

Invisible

Stick

I'm

I
let
'em
lick

my

I'm
a

A

I
spit
the

That

the

The

I'm

Otherwise

(Yah!)
That's

Up

That's

We

(Fack)
Okay,

I
say
this?
(Fack)
Last

Hah,

You

I've

Craig
G
"Duck

Wedgie
in
my
underwear,
the
whole
bed
sheet
and
the
comforter
Stuck

my
rectal
crack,
kiss
my
disrespectful
ass
I'll
ride
through
your
cul-de-sac
Window

bumpin'
your

Y-You
collaborative
effort
rap,
I-I
have
never
said
his
raps
O-Overstayed
my
welcome,
stepped
in
crap
And
ruined
your
welcome
mat
So
spit
that
shit
from
the
heart,
you
didn't
write
like
you
wrote
it
(Wrote
it)
(Yeah)
While
I
teabag
the
microphone
'cause
I
go
nuts
on
it
(On
it)
(Yeah)
Like
a
fighter
jet
lined
with
explosives
that'll
strike
any
moment
Headed
right
at
opponents
and
I'm
the
fuckin'
pilot
that
flown

I'm
'bout

Smash

I
turned
to
rap
'cause
it
made
me
feel
tough
when
I
wasn't
(Wasn't)
From
the
moment
I
heard
rappers
cussin',
I
was
in
(Was
in)
Which
is
why
I
identify
with
the
guy
Who
I
was
invented
by,
Dre's
Frankenstein
Energized
like
a
nine
volt
Ice
cold
like
Snake
Eyes,
twice
in
a
row
on
a
dice
roll
But
if
the
only
reason
I
blowed
is
'cause
I'm
white
though
Why
don't
every
other
white
rapper
sell
what
I
sold?
(Ooh)
Kamikaze
pilot,
I
wrote
my
suicide
note
Here

the
guys
in
white
coats
tryin'
to
stop
me
'Fore
I

foes
'Cause
I'm

me
when
I
go

I
don't

this
typhoon's
letting

here
I

Eyes

blindfolded,
I'm
'bout

Smash

Back

Take
a
look
at
what
I've
done
I
heard
your
freestyle
on
Shade
45,
that
shit
was
embarrassing
There
is
no
way
we
ever
air
that
shit
again,
I
guarantee
that
Wait,
that
shit
was
so
ass
it's
somethin'
we
wouldn't
dare
re-air
it
The
shit's
embarrassing
as
me
rear-ending
Tara
Reid
bare
In
my
therapy
chair,
my
dick
is
the
hair
length
of
Cher
Each
nut
is
the
chair
width
of
an
Acorn
stairlift,
beware
of
me
Lyrically
I'm
terrible,
better
get
your
lyrics
prepared
Richard

Wait,

Somethin'
evil

I'm
no

But
somethin'
here
is
a
foot—oh
yeah,
it's
my
dick
Get
the
measurin'
stick
(What?),
12
inches
of
wood
(Haha)
Wait,
but
I've
been
goin'
for
your
jugular
since
Craig
G
"Duck
Alert"
And
I've
come
to
pay
respects
'Cause
if
you
sleep
you're
fucked—other
words
You
get
laid
to
rest
and
I
hope
your
butt
is
hurt
Put
me
on
a
track,
I
go
cray-on
it
like
a
color
book
You
got
some
views,
but
you're
still
below
me
Mine
are
higher,
so
when
you
compare
our
views,
you
get
overlooked
And
I
don't
say
the
hook
unless
I
wrote
the
hook
And
now
I'm
just
freestylin'
in
the
vocal
booth
And
you
know
I've
always
spoke
the
truth
You're
lyin'
through
your
teeth
so
much
you
broke
a
tooth
And
it
ain't
somethin'
I
need
a
phone
to
do
When
I
say
I
can't
wait
'til
I
get
ahold
of
you
And
I
don't
know
what
I'm
s'posed
to
do
Line
up
the
rappers,
take
my
pic
like
a
photo

You
know,
everybody's
been
tellin'
me
What
they
think
about
me
for
the
last
few
months
It's
too
loud
Maybe
it's
time
I
tell
'em
what
I
think
about
them
Can't
hear
it
coming
down
the
hallway
stairs
from
the
parking
lot
It's
too
loud
Three’s
not
a
crowd
all
up
in

Slow

Don't

Don't

Gotta
concentrate,
against
the
clock
I
race
Got
no
time
to
waste,
I'm
already
late,
I
got
a
marathoner's
pace
Went
from
addict
to
a
workaholic,
word
to
Dr.
Dre
In
that
first
marijuana
tape—guess
I
got
a
chronic
case
(Yeah)
And
I
ain't
just
blowin'
smoke,
'less
it's
in
your
momma's
face
I
know
this
time
Paul
and
Dre
They
won't
tell
me
what
not
to
say
(Nope!)
And
though
me
and
my
party
days
Have
all
pretty
much
parted
ways
You'd
swear
to
God
I
forgot
I'm
the
guy
that
made
"Not
Afraid"
One
last
time
for
Charlamagne
If
my
response
is
late,
it's
just
how
long
it
takes
To
hit
my
fuckin'
radar,
I'm
so
far
away
These
rappers
are
like
Hunger
Games
One
minute,
they're
mockin'
JAY
Next
minute,
they
get
their
style
from
Migos
or
they
copy
Drake
Maybe
I
just
don't
know
when
to
turn
around
and
walk
away
But
all
the
hate,
I
call
it
Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've
had
as
much
as
I
can
tolerate
I'm
sick
and
tired
of
waitin',
I
done
lost
my
patience
I
can
take
all
of
you
motherfuckers
on
at
once
You
wanted
Shady?
You
got
him!
Don't
fall
on
my
face
(Yeah)
Don't
fall
on
my
faith,
oh
Don't
fall
on
my
fate
(Line
'em
up!)
Don't
fall
on
my
faith,
oh
(Rrr!)
Don't
fall
on
my
fate
(Look)
Somebody
tell
Budden
before
I
snap,
he
better
fasten
it
Or
have
his
body
bag
get
zipped
The
closest
thing
he's
had
to
hits
is
smackin'
bitches
(Pump
it
up!)
And
don't
make
me
have
to
give
it
back
to
Akademiks
Say
this
shit
is
trash
again,
I'll
have
you
twisted
Like
you
had
it
when
you
thought
you
had
me
slippin'
at
the
telly
Even
when
I'm
gettin'
brain,
you'll
never
catch
me
with

It's
not
just
'cause
you
lack

It's
because
you
worship

you're

The
fans
waited
for
this
moment
like
that
feature
When
I
stole
the
show
(Ha),
sorry
if
I
took
forever
(Ha-ha)
Don't
fall
on
my
face
(Yeah)
Don't
fall
on
my
faith,
oh
(I
won't)
Don't
fall
on

Don't
fall
on
my
faith,
oh
(Ha)
Don't
fall
on
my
fate
(It's
too
easy)
Just
remember,
I
was
here
before
you
And
I'll
be
here
after
you
make
your
run-in
for
you
Detractors,
I
might

Just

ordered
Revenge
is
the

(Yeah)
Increase
the
dose,
from
least
to
most
And
then
tell
the
Grammys
to
go
and
fuck
themselves
They
suck
the
blood
from
all
the
biggest
artists
like
some
leeches
So
they
nominate
'em,
get
'em
there,
get
a
name
to

Every
parasite

Then
give
Album

that
no
one's
ever

All
I
know
is
I

word
to
everything
I
ever
murdered
Time

(Yeah)
And
I
got
no

I
don't

When
rap
needed
it
most,
I
was
that
wing
and
a
prayer
(Huh)
A
beacon
of
hope,
put
a
B-I-R-D

Somewhere
some
kid
is
bumpin'
this
while
he
lip-syncs
in
the
mirror
That's
who
I'm
doin'
it
for,
the
rest
I
don't
really
even
care
But
you
would
think
I'm
carryin'
an
Oxford
dictionary
in
my
pocket
How
I'm
buryin'
these
artists
On
a
scale
of
'turnt'
you're
'minus'
Mine
says
'very',
yours
says
'hardly'
And
what's
scary
is
you
prob'ly
can
compare
me
to
your
car
'cause
I'm
just
barely
gettin'
started
(Woo)
And
far
as
Lord
Jamar,
you
better
leave
me
the
hell
alone
Or
I'll
show
you
an

Walk
up
in
this
house
you

thrust
my
pelvic
bone
Use
your
telephone
and
go
fetch
me
the
remote
Put
my
feet
up
and
just
make
myself
at
home
(Yeah)
I
belong
here,
clown!
Don't
tell
me
'bout
the
culture!
I
inspired
the
Hopsins,
the
Logics,
the
Coles,
the
Seans,
the
K-Dots,
the
5'9"s,
and
oh
Brought

50
Cent,
you
did
squat,
piss
and
moan
But
I'm
not
gonna
fall…
bitch
(Yeah)
It's
too
loud
Can't
hear
it
coming
down
the
hallway
stairs
from
the
parking
lot
It's
too
loud
Three’s
not

Slow

You're

I
play
your
music
while
you
suffer
like
I'm
Carmine
Coppola
You're
tied
up
in
the
basement
while
I
chill
on
your
sofa
La

yo
sé
que
mejor
me

sola
Estás

que

I'm
an
emotional
wreck,
weak
(Uh-huh)
Everything
over-affects
me
(Yeah)
When
you
joke,
it
upsets
me
(Yeah)
You
say
I'm
no
good
at
sex
And
you
think
I'm
gross
and
unsexy
(Uh-huh)
I
need
Scope
'cause
my
breath
stinks
(Yep)
You
hope
I
choke
on
a
Pepsi
(Yep)
Bitch,
you
was
supposed
to
correct
me!
(Oh)
Been
textin'
you
since
three,
I
still
get
no
fucking
reply
You
say
you
sleep
alone,
but
yet
your
mattress
is
king
size
Fuck
you
goin'
in
those
knee-high
boots?
Cut
it
out,
bitch
I
doubt
that
you're
goin'
to
house
sit
In
that
outfit,
and
those
skin-tight
Levi's
Every
word
that
comes
out
your
mouth's
a
fucking
lie
Oh,
it's
spring
time,
time
for
you
to
have
a
fling
like
a
slingshot
You
say
don't
come
over
'cause
you
got
pink
eye
But
I
think
I
got
just
the
thing,
why
Don't
I
bring
my
fuckin'
bat
and
just
swing
by?
Here
we
go
aga-ain,
from
heroes
to
villains
Used
to
be
your
Romeo
but
we
both
were
jilted
A
couple
of
times,
so
we
had
a
slippery
slope
to
deal
with
But
still,
it
gave
me
hope
that
we'll
get
Through
it
together,
a
severed
earlobe
Mailed
to
you
in
a
E-N-V-elope
Would
be
dope,
but
what
kind
of
lengths
can
you
go?
Pull
a
Vincent
van
Gogh,
just
to
convince
a
damn
ho
To
be
a
housewife
who
outright
lies
She's
blackout
drunk,
now
she's
backin'
out
my
drive
I
ran
outside,
why
is
she
tryna
act
out?
She's
just
about
my
size,
hit
me
in
the
mouth
twice
Guys,
when
someone
you'd
die
for
Sticks
a
steak
knife
in
your
heart,
do
you
try
more?
Another
late
night
in,
she
stumbles
through
my
door
Lets
the
daylight
in
and
all
we
do's
fight
more
And
I
ain't
violent,
but
she's
goin'
through
my
drawers
To
plant
the
K-Y
in,
I'm
gettin'
accused
by
a
whore
Who
smells
like
St.
Ides
and
who's
prob'ly
screwed
five
more
Guys,
sucked
eight/nine
men
I'm
takin'
two-by-fours
to
our
eight-by-tens
Bitch,
it's
you
I
tore
out
the
frame,
I
win
Put
up
a
new
high
score,
beat
this
game
I'm
in
And
here's
some
two-ply
for
when
you
date
my
friends
In
order
to
wipe
your
ass
when
you
moved
your
bowels
When
we
renewed
our
vows,
this
the
thanks
I
get?
I'm
waitin'
for
the
day
I
can
Hear
you
say,
"Marshall,
what
a
skank
I've
been."
"And
there's
a
new
guy,
you're
being
replaced
by
him."
Got
your
tubes
tied
for
him,
got
that
boob
job
for
him
Hurts
me
to
my
core,
but
the
pain
I'm
in
After
you,
I
swore
to
make
the
gray
skies
end
Here
come
the
rays
like
when
You
get
a
pay
hike
and
Am
I
the
good
guy
or
do
I
just
play
like
him
And
hope
that
he
dumps
you?
It's
like
a
dream
come
true,
just
to
scream,
"Fuck
you!"
Guess
you
take
life
in
the
same
way
you
play
dice
then
'Cause
you
just
look
at
me
and
roll
them
little
snake
eyes
in
Since—
Since
you
bought
the
jury,
they'll
call
me
guilty
They'll
call
me
guilty
You
bought
the
jury,
they'll
call
me
guilty
Even
though
you
know
the
real
me
You
can't
beat
a
cheater,
convince
a
nonbeliever
And
I
ain't
in
my
feelings,
I'm
out
But
I'll
let
you
say
that
you're
the
good
guy
'Cause
this
ain't
what
love
looks
like
You
can't
beat
a
cheater,
convince
a
nonbeliever
I
ain't
in
my
feelings,
I'm
out
But
I'll
let
you
say
that
you're
the
good
guy
Play
like
you're
the
good
guy
Play
like,
play
like,
play
like
you're
the
good
guy
I
got
a
song
filled
with
shit
for
the
strong-willed
When
the
world
gives
you
a
raw
deal
Sets
you
off
'til
you
scream,
"Piss
off!
Screw
you!"
When
it
talks
to
you
like
you
don't
belong
Or
tells
you
you're
in
the
wrong
field
When
something's
in
your
mitochondrial
'Cause
it
latched
on
to
you,
like—
Knock
knock,
let

Wicked,
I

when
I

I've
smelled
the
scent
Of
elephant
manure—hell,
I
meant
Kahlúa
Screw
it,
to
hell
with
it,
I
went
through
hell
with
accelerants
And
blew
up
my-my-myself
again
Volkswagen,
tailspin,
bucket
matches
my

Me

Proof's

slept
on
the
floor
of

then
Dr.
Dre
said,
"Hell

And
I
got
his
stamp
like
a
postcard,
word
to
Mel-Man
And
I
know
they're
gonna
hate
But
I
don't
care,
I
barely
can
wait
To
hit
'em
with
the
snare
and
the
bass
Square
in
the
face,
this
fuckin'
world
better
prepare
to
get
laced
Because
they're
gonna
taste
my—
Venom,
(I
got
that)
adrenaline
momentum
And
I'm
not
knowin'

I'm
Ever

I'm
Ready

I'm
Thinkin'
it's

They

(W-W-When

Shotgun
p-p-pellets
in

Cocked,

and
catch
a
hot

It-it's
evident
I'm
not

V-Venomous,
the
thoughts
spun
Like
a

and
you

Held

able
to

what
the
fuck's
happenin'
to
ya
When
you're
bit
with
the—
Venom,
adrenaline
momentum
And
I'm
not
knowin'
when
I'm
Ever
gonna
slow
up
and
I'm
Ready
to
snap
any
moment
I'm
Thinkin'
it's
time
to
go
get
'em
They
ain't
gonna
know
what
hit
'em
(W-W-When
they
get
bit
with
the—)
Venom,
(I
got
that)
adrenaline
momentum
And
I'm
not
knowin'
when
I'm
Ever
gonna
slow
up
and
I'm
Ready
to

I'm
Thinkin'
it's

They
ain't
gonna

'em
(W-W-When
they

I
said
knock
knock,
let
the
devil
in
Alien,
E-E-Elliott
phone
home
Ain't
no
telling
when
this
chokehold
On
this
game
will
end,
I'm
loco
Became
a
Symbiote,
so
My
fangs
are
in
your
throat,
ho
You're
snake-bitten
with
my—venom
With
the
ballpoint
pen
I'm
Gun
cocked,
bump
stock,
double-aught,
buckshot
Tire
thumper,
a
garrote,
tie
a
couple
knots
Fired
up
and
caught
fire,
juggernaut
Punk
rock,
bitch,
it's
goin'
down
like
Yung
Joc
'Cause
the
Doc
put
me
on
like
sunblock
Why
the
fuck
not,
you
only
get
one
shot
Ate
shit
'til
I
can't
taste
it
Chased
it
with
straight
liquor
Then
paint
thinner,
then
drank
'til
I
faint
And
awake
with
a
headache
And
I
take
anything
in
rectangular
shape
Then
I
wait
to
face
the
demons
I'm
bonded
to
'Cause
they're
chasin'
me
but
I'm
part
of
you
So
escapin'
me
is
impossible
I
latch
onto
you
like
a—parasite
And
I
probably
ruined
your
parents'
life
And
your
childhood
too
'Cause
if
I'm
the
music
that
y'all
grew
up
on
I'm
responsible
for
you
retarded
fools
I'm
the
super
villain
Dad
and
Mom
was
losin'
their
marbles
to
You
marvel
that?
Eddie
Brock
is
you
And
I'm
the
suit,
so
call
me—
Venom,
(I
got
that)
adrenaline
momentum
And
I'm
not
knowin'
when
I'm
Ever
gonna
slow
up
and
I'm
Ready
to
snap
any
moment
I'm
Thinkin'
it's
time
to
go
get
'em
They
ain't
gonna
know
what
hit
'em
(W-W-When
they
get

with
the—)
Venom,
(I

And
I'm

I
walk
on
water
But
I
ain't
no
Jesus
I
walk
on
water
But
only
when
it
freezes
(Fuck)
Why
are
expectations
so
high?
Is
it
the
bar
I
set?
My
arms,
I
stretch,
but
I
can’t
reach
A
far
cry
from
it,
or
it's
in
my
grasp,
but
as
Soon
as
I
grab,
squeeze
I
lose
my
grip
like
the
flying
trapeze
Into
the
dark
I
plummet,
now
the
sky's
blackening
I
know
the
mark’s
high,
butter–
flies
rip
apart
my
stomach
Knowin'
that
no
matter
what
bars
I
come
with
You're
gonna
harp,
gripe,
and
That's
a
hard
Vicodin
to
swallow,
so
I
scrap
these
As
pressure
increases
like
khakis
I
feel
the
ice
cracking,
because—
I
walk
on
water
But
I
ain't
no
Jesus
(It's
the
curse
of
the—,
it's
the
curse
of
the—)
I
walk
on
water
(Shit)
But
only
when
it
freezes
It's
the
curse
of
the
standard,
that
the
first
of
the
Mathers
disc
set
Always
in
search
of
the
verse
that
I
haven’t
spit
yet
Will
this
step
just
be
another
misstep
To
tarnish
whatever
the
legacy,
love
or
respect
I’ve
garnered?
The
rhyme
has
to
be
perfect,
the
delivery
flawless
And
it
always
feels
like
I'm
hittin’
the
mark
'Til
I
go
sit
in
the
car,
listen
and
pick
it
apart
Like,
"This
shit
is
garbage!"
God's
given
me
all
this,
still
I
feel
no
different
regardless
Kids
look
to
me
as
a
god,
this
is
retarded
If
only
they
knew,
it's
a
facade
and
it’s
exhaustive
And
I
try
not
to
listen
to
nonsense
But
if
you
bitches
are
tryin'
to
strip
me
of
my
confidence
Mission
accomplished
I'm
not
God-sent,
Nas,
Rakim,
'Pac,
B.I.G.,
James
Todd
Smith
And
I'm
not
Prince,
so…
I
walk
on
water
But
I
ain't
no
Jesus
I
walk
on
water
(It's
true,
I'm
a
Rubik's—,
it's
true—)
But
only
when
it
freezes
(It's
true—)
'Cause
I'm
only
human,
just
like
you
Making
my
mistakes,
oh
if
you
only
knew
I
don't
think
you
should
believe
in
me
the
way
that
you
do
'Cause
I'm
terrified
to
let
you
down,
oh
It's
true,
I'm
a
Rubik's—a
beautiful
mess
At
times
juvenile,
yes,
I
goof
and
I
jest
A
flawed
human,
I
guess
But
I'm
doin'
my
best
to
not
ruin
your
ex–
pectations
and
meet
'em,
but
first
The
"Speedom"
verse,
now
Big
Sean
He's
goin'
too
fast,
is
he
gonna
shout
or
curse
out
his
mom?
There
was
a
time
I
had
the
world
by
the
balls,
eatin'
out
my
palm
Every
album
song
I
was
spazzin'
the
fuck
out
on
And
now
I'm
gettin'
clowned
and
frowned
on
But
the
only
one
who's
looking
down
on
Me
that
matters
now's
DeShaun
Am
I
lucky
to
be
around
this
long?
Begs
the
question
though
Especially
after
the
methadone
As
yesterday
fades
and
the
Dresden
home
Is
burnt
to
the
ground
and
all
that's
left
of
my
house
is
lawn
The
crowds
are
gone
And
it's
time
to
wash
out
the
blonde
Sales
decline,
the
curtain's
drawn
They're
closin'
the
set,
I'm
still
pokin'
my
head
from
out
behind
And
everyone
who
has
doubt,
remind
Now
take
your
best
rhyme,
outdo
it,
now
do
it
a
thousand
times
Now
let
'em
tell
ya
the
world
no
longer
cares
Or
gives
a
fuck
about
your
rhymes
And
as
I
grow
outta
site,
outta
mind,
I
might
go
outta
mine
'Cause
how
do
I
ever
let
this
mic
go
without
a
fight
When
I
made
a
fuckin'
tightrope
outta
twine?
But
when
I
do
fall
from
these
heights
though,
I'll
be
fine
I
won't
pout
or
cry
or
spiral
down
or
whine
But
I'll
decide
if
it's
my
final
bow
this
time
around,
'cause—
I
walk
on
water
But
I
ain't
no
Jesus
I
walk
on
water
But
only
when
it
freezes
'Cause
I'm
only
human,
just
like
you
I've
been
making
my
mistakes,
oh
if
you
only
knew
I
don't
think
you
should
believe
in
me
the
way
that
you
do
'Cause
I'm
terrified
to
let
you
down,
oh
If
I
walked
on
water,
I
would
drown
'Cause
I'm
just
a
man
But
as
long
as
I
got
a
mic,
I'm
godlike
So
me
and
you
are
not
alike
Bitch,
I
wrote
"Stan"
And
I
started
from
the
bottom
Like
a
snowman—ground-up
Like
round
chuck,
and
still
put
hands
on
you
Stayin'
wound
up
is
how
I
spend
time
(Get
it?)
Sucker
free,
confidence
high
Such
a
breeze
when
I
pen
rhymes
I
just
got
that
air
about
me
like
wind
chimes
(Yeah)
'Nother
day
in
the
life
(Uh)
Used
to
have
to
scrape
to
get
by
(Yeah)
Now
my
community's
gated
and
I
Made
it
and
my
neighbors
say
hi
(Say
hi)
I'm
givin'
'em
pounds,
I'm
upscale
now
Guess
it
means
I'm
way
in
the
sky
(Way
in
the
sky)
But
I
still
remember
the
days
of
Minimum
wage
for
general
labor
Welfare
recipient
since
a
minor
Look
how
government
assistance
has
made
ya!
Adversity,
if
at
first
you
don't
succeed
Put
your
temper
to
more
use
'Cause
bein'
broke's
a
poor
excuse
That
should
only
give
you
more
fuel
Show
'em
why
you're
you
So
close,
God,
it's
like
I
almost
got
it
But
close
only
counts
in
time
bombs
and
horseshoes
So
I
Unabomb
shit—tick,
tick,
tick—no
remorse,
pew!
Screw
it,
I'm
lit,
and
that
attitude
I
blew
up
on
quick
That's
why
they
call
me
firecracker
I
grew
up
on
WIC—wick,
wick,
wick—with
a
short
fuse
I
got
some
important
news
to
report
to
Anyone
who
thought
I
was
done:
nah
bitch,
not
quite
Spotlight's
back
on,
got
my
faith,
where's
yours?
Do
you
still
believe
in
me?
Didn't
I
give
everything
I
had
to
give
you
to
make
you
see?
I'll
never
forget
if
you
turn
your
back
on
me
now
And
walk
out,
I
will
never
let
you
live
it
down
I'll
never
quit,
do
you
still
believe
in
me?
Man,
I
know
sometimes
These
thoughts
can
be
harsh
and
cold
as
ice
To
me
they're
just
ink
blots
I
just
fling
'em
like
slingshots
and
so
precise
So
you
might
wanna
think
it
over
twice
(Yeah)
Or
you
retards
can
roll
the
dice
But
beef
will
at
least
cost
you
your
career
'Cause
even
my
cheap
shots
are
overpriced
But
this
middle
finger's
free
as
a
bird
Nuke
warhead
at
birth,
hugest
forehead
on
Earth
Too
short
for
the
verse,
studied
his
formula,
learned
How
to
incorporate
a
curse
Point
it
towards
corporate
America
Stick
a
fork
in
and
turn
'Cause
four-letter
words
are
more
better
heard
The
world
force-fed
a
turd
to
me,
you're
getting
yours
But
sometimes
I
overdo
it,
but
I
just
get
so
into
it
I
was
there
consolin'
you
when
no
one
knew
it
When
your
situation
showed
no
improvement
I
was
that
door,
you
walked
over
to
it
I'm
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
So
people
are
always
lookin'
to
me
as
they're
goin'
through
it
When
that
tunnel
vision
is
unclear
Shit
becomes
too
much
to
bear
Since
"Cleanin'
Out
My
Closet"
When
I
was
havin'
trouble
with
the
snare
I'm
that
unrealistic
prayer
answered
And
I'ma
get
you
jacked
up
like
you're
tryna
fix
a
flat,
uh
When
you
struggle
with
despair
That
double-fisted,
bare-knuckles
coupled
with
this
pair
Of
nuts
I'm
cuppin',
I
am
your
'fuck
it'
switch,
nothin'
can
compare
Do
you
still
believe
in
me?
Didn't
I
give
everything
I
had
to
give
you
to
make
you
see?
I'll
never
forget
if
you
turn
your
back
on
me
now
And
walk
out,
I
will
never
let
you
live
it
down
I'll
never
quit,
do
you
still
believe
in
me?
Started
from
the
bottom
like
a
snowman
Oh
man,
put
that
in
your
corncob
pipe
and
smoke
that
But
my
battery's
low,
I'ma
need
a
boost
to
my
pack
And
I
know
that
I
always
got
Proof
at
my
back
I
called
you
"Proof"
because
I
knew
for
a
fact
My
ace
in
the
hole,
homie,
I'm
callin'
on
you
'Cause
I
think
I'm
slowly
startin'
to
lose
faith
in
it,
so
Give
me
that
inkling
and
mo–
–tivation
to
go,
Hussein
with
the
flow
Fake
fans
that
are
two-faced
didn't
show
Let
heartbeats
loop,
produce
hate
in
my
soul
Layin'
vocals
two
days
in
a
row
True
statement,
hate
to
go
down
this
road
But
there's
only
one
route
to
cross
this
bridge
So
I
walk
in
this
bitch
with
loose
change
'Cause
all
my
dues
paid,
but
this
booth's
takin'
its
toll
But
it's
never
too
late
to
start
a
new
beginnin'
That
goes
for
you
too,
so
what
the
fuck
you
gon'
do?
Use
the
tools
you're
given!
Or
you're
gon'
use
the
cards
you're
dealt
As
an
excuse
for
you
to
not
do
shit
with
'em?
I
used
to
play
the
loser/victim
'Til
I
saw
the
way
Proof
was
driven
I
found
my
vehicle
and
I
haven't
ran
out
of
gas
yet
And
when
they
stacked
decks,
turn
handicaps
into
assets
Fanny
packs,
hourglasses
If
time
was
on
my
side,
I'd
still
have
none
to
waste
Man,
in
my
younger
days
That
dream
was
so
much
fun
to
chase
It's
like
I'd
run
in
place
While
this
shit
dangled
in
front
of
my
face
But
how
do
you
keep
up
the
pace
And
the
hunger
pangs
once
you've
won
the
race?
When
that
dual
exhaust
is
coolin'
off
'Cause
you
don't
got
nothin'
left
to
prove
at
all
'Cause
you
done
already
hit
'em
with
the
coup
de
grâce
Still
you
feel
the
need
to
go
full
tilt
That
Bruce
Willis,
that
Blue
Steel,
that
true
skill
When
that
wheel's
loose,
I
won't
lose
will
Do
you
still
believe?
Instinctive
nature
to
bring
the
anguish
(Yeah)
To
the
English
language
With
this
ink,
you
haters
get
rode
on
like
a
piece
of
paper
This
rap
shit
got
me
travelin'
place
to
place
You
barely
leave
your
house
'Cause
you're
always
stuck
at
your
pad,
it's
stationary
Yeah,
that's
why
when
I
brainstorm,
gotta
write
it
out
Simon
Cowell
of
rhymin'
foul,
that's
why
you
sound
so
shook
Wire
bound
notebook
got
tied
around
your
throat
Hook
it
inside
your
mouth,
go—hruh
That's
what
it's
like
when
the
mic
is
out
'Cause
I'm
tearin'
at
your
flesh
with
it
'Til
your
larynx
and
neck
are
split
With
these
lyrics,
weapons,
expert
with
Like
hair
extensions,
extra
clips
And
you're
scared
to
effin'
death
of
it
Bitch,
you're
starin'
at
a
legend
that
In
a
pair
of
Skechers,
sweatshirt
ripped
And
hoodie
black,
should
be
strapped
To
a
chair
or
stretcher,
electric,
swear
on
every
record,
bitch
Finger
so
high
in
the
air,
I'll
bet
your
senses
flip
Like
a
barometric
pressure
switch
Carin'
less
who
I
offend
with
this
I'm
at
your
neck
like
Pez
dispense
Go
'head,
spit
your
flow,
bitch!
I'm
at
your
throat
like
Chloraseptic,
'septic
And
you
got
strep,
I'm
too
complex
with
it,
'plex
with
it
This
shit
I
wrote
is
on
some
next
shit,
next
shit
I'm
at
your
throat,
I'm
feelin'
reckless,
reckless,
yeah
And
I'll
take
a
hundred
of
you,
hundred
of
you
All
at
once
like
I
had
nothin'
to
lose,
what
can
I
do?
My
appetite
for
destruction
is
loose,
destruction
is
loose
And
all
it
wants
is
to
have
somethin'
to
chew
Somethin'
to
chew,
somethin'
to
chew
Yeah,
uh
(Haha),
and
still
conjoined
at
The
hip
with
hop,
still
on
point
and
poignant
Skilled
as
Floyd
is
In
this
field,
and
still
no
filter,
boy
I'll
put
you
in
your
place
(Yeah)
like
a
realtor,
boy
You
still
ain't
in
the
buildin',
boy
I
will
destroy
shit,
even
as
I
build
it
Get
the
drill
bit,
pen
is
filled
with
poison
Which
is
the
source,
easy
to
still
pinpoint
it
(Like
what?)
Like
a
real
thin
joint
it
(What?)
Comes
on
Quilted
Northern
(And
what?)
In
a
built-in
toilet
(Yeah)
Bitch,
I
told
you
I'm
a
dog
(Woof)
I
wouldn't
heal
with
ointment
Way
I'm
kickin'
these
fairies'
tails
Should
write
a
children's
storybook
(Yeah,
yeah,
yeah)
Million
voices
in
my
head
But
still
get
a
little
bit
of
thrill
and
some
real
enjoyment
(Off
what?)
Off
the
feel
of
going
in
(Like?)
Like
your
bitch
when
she
gives
me
brain
Like
she
thinks
I'm
dumb
Grabs
the
crown
of
my
dick
and
blows
me
to
kingdom
come
'Til
I
feel
anointed
She
makes
iller
noises
When
she's
with
me,
must
be
from
the
Windy
City,
uh
Pretty
apparent,
she's
a
MILF
when
blowin'
me
'Cause
I
conned
her
into
Rippin'
the
condom
in
two
(Woo!)
Dick
is
a
bargainin'
tool
Now
I'm
gettin'
blew
like
Klonopins,
Rude
Jude
I
go
there,
you
wouldn't
Well,
I
still
have
a
few
views
in
common
with
you
Just
not
YouTube,
'cause…
I'm
at
your
throat
like
Chloraseptic,
'septic
And
you
got
strep,
I'm
too
complex
with

'plex
with
it
This
shit
I
wrote
is
on
some
next
shit,
next
shit
I'm
at
your
throat,
I'm
feelin'
reckless,
reckless,
yeah
You're
a
has-been
That
has
been
the
case
since
back
when
You
last
went
and
threw
your
hat
in
the
race
You've
been
trash
(Bitch!)
Stick
your
raps
in
the
trash
bin
Or
end
up
in
my
next
rhyme
You're
a
fuckboy,
so
next
time
It's
gonna
be
heads
flyin'
like
Dez
Bryant
With
a
TEC-9
against
Rex
Ryan
(Yeah!)
Now
watch
me
set
it
like
correct
time
All
you
get
is
sloppy
seconds
like
a
Timex,
I
Clock
rejects
into
the
next
life
Talking
reckless,
but
it's
just
my
Strongest
suit,
but
you
can
get
my
Colombian
necktie
Prostitute,
just
climb
in
the
Humvee
and
let's
ride
Why
you
hitching
at
night?
I
put
an
end
to
your
life,
sex
crime
Kidding
aside,
insidious
vibe
Girl,
you
know
you
got
the
prettiest
eyes
But
all
you're
getting
is
bribed
Any
old
lie
to
try
to
get
you
inside
Then
we
gon'
end
up
spending
the
night
And
I'm
skinning
your
hide
like
an
Indian
tribe
What
kind
of
nut
drives
a
Budweiser
truck
Finds
a
slut,
tries
to
surprise
her,
cuffs,
ties
her
up
Binds
up,
cuts,
slices
her
twice?
But
the
muff
diver
must
just
like
it
rough
Fuck
right
in
her
vagina,
blood
Flies
up
on
the
visor,
like
a
geyser,
uh
(Music,
please!)
Enthusiast
of
the
roofie
Goal
is
to
get
a
floozy
inside
the
Jacuzzi
And
have
a
loosey-goosey
as
Cool
C
is
with
an
Uzi
But
I
am
to
rap
what
blue
jeans
mean
to
Bruce
Springsteen
Glued
we
be,
I'm
truTV,
you're

PG
I'm
Schoolly
D,
you're
Spoonie
Gee!
No
diss
there,
just
notice
there
Are
no
similarities
that
we
share
Besides
the
fact
we
breathe
air
Happily
married
to
rap
and
I'm
glad
that
we
buried
The
hatchet
and
patched
it
up
Now
I'm
back
to
ratchet
up
my
attack
And
I'm
at
your
mothafuckin'
throat
like—
—throat
like
Chloraseptic,
'septic
And
you
got
strep,
I'm
too
complex
with
it,
'plex
with
it
This
shit
I
wrote
is
on
some
next
shit,
next
shit
I'm
at
your
throat,
I'm
feelin'
reckless,
reckless,
yeah
And
I'll
take
a
hundred
of
you,
hundred
of
you
All
at
once
like
I
had
nothin'
to
lose,
what
can
I
do?
My
appetite
for
destruction
is
loose,
destruction
is
loose
And
all
it
wants
is
to
have
somethin'
to

Somethin'

somethin'

Pt.
I
Hands
up,
officer
don’t
shoot
Then
pull
your
pants
up,
promise
you
won't
loot
We
may
never
understand
each
other,
it’s
no
use
We
ain’t
ever
gonna
grasp
what
each
other
goes
through
Black
boy,
black
boy,
we
ain't
gonna
lie
to
you
Black
boy,
black
boy,
we
don't
like
the
sight
of
you
Pull
up
on
the
side
of
you
Window
rolled
down,
'profile'
Then
we
wonder
why
we
see
this
side
of
you
Probably
comin'
from
the
dope
house
We
could
let
you
slide
but
your
tail
light
is
blew,
out
We
know
you're
hidin'
that
Heidi
Klum
On
you
another
drug
charge,
homie,
it's
back
inside
for
you
And
just
in
case
a
chase
might
ensue,
we
got
that
tried
and
true
Pistol
drew
right
at
you,
we'd
be
delighted
to
unload
it
In
your
back,
then
walk
up
and
lay
that
taser
on
the
side
of
you
Fucked
up,
but
what
the
fuck
am
I
to
do?
I
keep
tellin'
myself,
keep
doin'
like
you're
doin'
No
matter
how
many
lives
you
ruin
It's
for
the
red,
white
and
blue
Time
to
go
find
a
new
one
and
split
his
head
right
in
two
No
one's
ever
indicted
you
Why?
'Cause
you're
a...
White
boy,
white
boy,
you're
a
rockstar
My
momma
talkin'
to
me,
tryna
tell
me
how
to
live
White
boy,
white
boy,
in
your
cop
car
But
I
don't
listen
to
her,
'cause
my
head
is
like
a
sieve
White
boy,
white
boy,
you're
untouchable
The
world's
coming
to
an
end,
I
don't
even
care
Nobody
can
tell
me
shit
'cause
I'm
a
big
rockstar
Black
boy,
black
boy,
we
don't
get
your
culture
and
We
don't
care
what
our
government's
done
to
fuck
you
over,
man
Don't
tell
us
your
attitude's
a
result
of
that
Balderdash,
where’d
you
get
the
chip
on
your
shoulder
at?
Why
you
kicking
that
soda
can?
Pull
your
pants
up,
we
'bout
to
roll
up
and
Throw
your
ass
in
the
van
cuffed
You
don't
have
to
know
our
plans
or
what
our
intentions
are
Our
cards
are
close
to
our
chest,
you
better
show
your
hands
And
put
our
minds
more
at
ease
Or
get
shot
in
the
thyroid,
comply
or
die,
boy
We're
fightin'
a
crime
war,
here
come
the
swine
Tryna
clean
up
the
streets
from
all
these
minorities
That's
what
we
call
'em
pigsties
for
They're
like
eyesores
to
police
Talk
to
you
like
just
a
piece
of
trash
Feels
like
we're
stuck
in
a
time
warp
to
me
As
I
kick
these
facts
and
get
these
mixed
reactions
As
this
beat
backspins,
it's
like
we're
drifting
back
in
To
the
sixties,
having
black
skin
is
risky
'Cause
this
keeps
happening
Throughout
history,
African-Americans
have
been
treated
like
shit
And
I
admit,
there
have
been
times
where
it's
been
embarrassin'
to
be
a...
White
boy,
white
boy,
you're
a
rockstar
My
momma
talkin'
to
me,
tryna
tell
me
how
to
live
White

white

in
your

But
I
don't
listen
to

'cause
my

is
like

White

white

you're
untouchable
The
world's
coming
to
an

Nobody

Pt.
II
Seems
like
the
average
lifespan
of
a
white
man
Is
more
than
twice
than
a
black
life
span
I
wonder
sometimes
if
it
has
a
price
scanner
I
feel
like
checking
out
on
life,
can't
escape
this
circumstance
I'd
rather
hear
'em
say
"Die
N-word"
than
Die
Antwoord
Ninja,
now
it's
better
disguised
banter
But
that's
life,
strapped
'cause
we're
strapped
financially
And
can't
find
answers
We're
applying,
but
McDonald's
Seems
to
be
the
only
franchise
that'll
hire
So
how
can
we
have
higher
standards?
As
Dallas
overshadows
the
battle
for
Black
Lives
Matter
We
fight
back
with
violence
but
acts
like
that
are
Black
eyes
on
the
movement
Which
makes
black
lives
madder
At
cops
and
cops
madder
That's
why
it's
at
a
stalemate
And
can't
arrive
at
a
compromise
so
it's
Black
Ops
I
wonder
if
we
hire
more
black
cops,
the
crap
stops
The
block
is
our
backyards,
officers,
not
the
crack
spot
Call
the
attack
dogs
off
of
us,
man
You
always
act
all
pissed
off
at
us
at
a
traffic
stop
And
bad
cops
fuck
it
up
for
the
good
cops,
and
man,
stop
Sendin'
white
cops
in
the
black
neighborhoods
Who
ain't
acclimated
to
'em,
like
that's
the
way
to
do
it
Who
seen
some
fuckin'
videos
of
rappers
waving
guns
And
know
nobody
black
so
they
act
afraid
of
us
And
that's
racism,
the
fear
that
a
black
face
gives
'em
A
subconscious
racist
Wait,
why
are
there
black
neighborhoods?
'Cause
America
segregated
us,
designated
us
to
an
area
Separated
us,
Section-Eight'd
us
When
we
tear
it
up’s
the
only
time
attention’s
paid
to
us
And
education
sucks,
and
every
day's
another
Freddie
Gray
for
us,
a
levy
breaks
or
fuzz
Why
is
it
they
treat
us
like
dryer
lint?
We
just
want
a
safe
environment
for
our
kids
But
can’t
escape
the
sirens
Don’t
take
a
scientist
to
see
our
violent
nature
lies
in
The
poverty
that
we
face
so
the
crime
rate’s
the
highest
in
The
lowest
classes,
it's
like
a
razor
wire
fence
And
we’re
trapped
in
these
racial
biases
That
plague
our
society
which
makes
our
anxiety
levels
raise
Every
time
we
see
a
devil’s
face
Lions,
tigers,
and
bears,
oh
my
It's
more
like
billy
clubs
and
gats
And
we
really
love
it
when
you
think
we’re
guilty
‘cause
we’re
black
"But
you
kill
each
other,
facts
You
peel
each
other's
caps,
for
silly
stuff
like
hats”
Single
mother
strugglin’
through
substance
abuse
While
people
with
nothin'
to
lose
shoot
each
other
for
shoes
Fuck
your
Republican
views
Pull
ourselves
up
by
our
bootstraps,
where
the
fuck
are
the
boots?
And
streets
act
as
a
narrator,
don't
gotta
read
comics
Or
be
that
into
characters,
just
to
see
that,
just
to
be
black
You
better
be
strapped
with
a
derringer
Or
be
“capped
in
America”
like
Steve
Rogers
'Cause
no
one
oversees
these
cops
and
All
we
see
is
'em
beat
charges
We
done
seen
'em
beat
Rodney
King
unconscious,
and
got
off
So
we
don't
need
all
you
crooked
police
officers'
peace
offerings
Just
keep
marchin',
'til
we
reach
congress
But
they're
gonna
say
you're
tryin'
to
take
an
irrational
stance
If
you
try
to
slander
the
flag
but
Somebody
has
to
be
the
sacrificial
lamb
So
they
call
it
a
Kaepernick
tantrum
If
you
don't
stand
for
the
national
anthem
We
raise
it,
you
better
praise
it
Or
you'll
be
made
to
feel
like
a
traitor,
we'll
Treat
you
like
Rodney
Dangerfield
Home
of
the
brave
is
still
racist
'ville
So
this
whole
nation
feels
like
a
plantation
field
In
a
country
that
claims
that
its
foundation
was
based
on
United
States
ideals
That
had
its
Natives
killed
Got
you
singin'
this
star-spangled
spiel
To
a
piece
of
cloth
that
represents
the
"Land
of
the
Free"
that
made
people
slaves
to
build
I've
been
a
liar,
been
a
thief
Been
a
lover,
been
a
cheat
All
my
sins
need
holy
water,
feel
it
washing
over
me
Well,
little
one,
I
don't
want
to
admit
to
something
If
all
it's
gonna
cause
is
pain
Truth
and
my
lies
right
now
are
falling
like
the
rain
So
let
the
river
run
He's
comin'
home
with
his
neck
scratched,
to
catch
flack
Sweat
jackets
and
dress
slacks,
mismatched
On
his
breath's
Jack,
he's
a
sex
addict
And
she
just
wants
to
exact
revenge
and
get
back
It's
a
chess
match,
she's
on
his
back
like
a
jet-pack
She's
kept
track
of
all
his
Internet
chats
And
guess
who
just
happens
to
be
movin'
on
to
the
next
Actually,
just
shit
on
my
last
chick
and
she
has
what
my
ex
lacks
'Cause
she
loves
danger,
psychopath
And
you
don't
fuck
with
no
man's
girl,
even
I
know
that
But
she's
devised
some
plan
to
stab
him
in
the
back
Knife
in
hand,
says
their
relationship's
hangin'
by
a
strand
So
she's
been
on
the
web
lately
Says
maybe
she'll
be
my
Gwen
Stacy,
to
spite
her
man
And
I
know
she's
using
me
to
try
to
play
him,
I
don't
care
Hi
Suzanne,
but
I
shoulda
said
"Bye
Suzanne"
After
the
first
night,
but
tonight
I
am
I've
been
a
liar,
been
a
thief
Been
a
lover,
been
a
cheat
All
my
sins
need
holy
water,
feel
it
washing
over
me
Well,
little
one,
I
don't
want
to
admit
to
something
If
all
it's
gonna
cause
is
pain
The
truth
and
my
lies
now
are
falling
like
the
rain
So
let
the
river
run
A
one-night
stand
turned
a
two-night
stand
It
was
"come
sunlight,
scram,"
now
we
hug
tight,
and...
He
found
out,
now
she
feels
deserted
and
used
'Cause
he
left,
so
what?
He
did
it
first
to
her
too
Now
how
am
I
supposed
to
tell
this
girl
that
we're
through?
It's
hard
to
find
the
words,
I'm
aloof,
nervous,
and
Sue
Don't
want
this
to
hurt,
but
what
you
deserve
is
the
truth
Don't
take
it
personal,
I
just
can't
say
this
in
person
to
you
So
I
revert
to
the
studio,
like
hole-in-the-wall
diners
Don't
have
to
be
reserved
in
a
booth
I
just
feel
like
the
person
who
I'm
turning
into's
Irreversible,
I
preyed
on
you
like
it's
church
at
the
pew
And
now
that
I
got
you
I
don't
want
you
Took
advantage
in
my
thirst
to
pursue
Why
do
I
do
this
dirt
that
I
do?
Get
on
my
soapbox
and
preach,
my
sermon
and
speech
Detergent
and
bleach
is
burnin'
the
wound
'Cause
now
with
her
in
the
womb
We
can't
bring
her
in
this
world,
shoulda
knew
To
use
protection
'fore
I
bit
into
your
forbidden
fruit
Fuck!
I've
been
a
liar,
been
a
thief
Been
a
lover,
been
a
cheat
All
my
sins
need
holy
water,
feel
it
washing
over
me
Well,
little
one,
I
don't
want
to
admit
to
something
If
all
it's
gonna
cause
is
pain
The
truth
and
my
lies
now
are
falling
like
the
rain
So
let
the
river
run
My
name's
(ooh),
my
name's
(ooh)
River
(ooh),
river
run
Call
me
(ooh),
call
me
(ooh)
River
(ooh),
we'll
let
the
river
run
Always
the
bridesmaid,
never
"The
bride,
hey!"
Fuck
can
I
say?
If
life
was
a
highway
And
deceit
was
an
enclave,
I'd
be
swerving
in
five
lanes
Speeds
at
a
high
rate,
like
I'm
slidin'
on
ice,
maybe
That's
why
I
may
have
came
at
you
sideways
I
can't
keep
my
lies
straight
But
I
made
you
terminate
my
baby
This
love
triangle
left
us
in
a
wreck,
tangled
What
else
can
I
say?
It
was
fun
for
a
while
Bet
I
really
woulda
loved
your
smile
Didn't
really
wanna
abort,
but
fuck
it
What's
one
more
lie,
to
tell
our
unborn
child?
I've
been
a
liar,
been
a
thief
Been
a
lover,
been
a
cheat
All
my
sins
need
holy
water,
feel
it
washing
over
me
Well,
little
one
(I'm
sorry)
I
don't
want
to
admit
to
something
(I
fucked
up)
If
all
it's
gonna
cause
is
pain
The
truth
and
my
lies
now
are
falling
like
the
rain
So
let
the
river
run
Yeah
Damn
girl
Do
I
drive
you
crazy?
You
make
me
crazy,
too
You
make
me
do
things
I
normally
wouldn't
do
You
make
me
feel
things
That
I
never
felt
You
gotta
be
the
real
thing
’Cause
you
remind
me
of
myself
Yo!
I
bust
in,
devilish
grin,
disgustin'
Asshole,
freckled
cheeks
and
a
butt-chin
Callin'
all
party
animals,
get
On
the
floor
when
I
pop
up
on
some
Whac-A-Mole
shit
In
search
of
a
chick
who's
stacked
and
so
thick
And
implants
are
so
big
She
can
hang
me
up
on
that
rack,
big
ol'
tits
Like
Anna
Nicole
Smith
Body's
bananas
and
sass
to
go
with
I
spot
you
at
first
glance
and
go
"shit!"
You
wearin'
those
pants
that
don't
fit
That
butt
won't
ever
give
up
That's
why
you
stick
it
out
no
matter
what,
huh?
'Cause
you
got
an
ass
that
won't
quit
So,
get
on
the
horn,
my
saxophone
Grab
hold
of
my
instrument,
get
a
grasp,
and
blow
"whee"
You
just
laugh
and
go
heehee
'Cause
you're
just
as
nasty
so
that's
appropriate
That's
why—
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me
(Yeah,
me)
I
said
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me,
nasty
(Yeah,
me)
You
know,
I'm
wearin'
a
new
shirt
tonight
too
With
me
on
it
I'm
lookin'
at
your
tight
rear
like
a
sightseer
Your
booty
is
heavy
duty
like
diarrhea
The
plan's
to
bring
you
to
my
house
You're
drinkin'
Jack
and
Beam
I'm
thinkin'
soon
this
tramp'll
lean
so
we
should
bounce
But
you're
outta
your
tube-top
If
you're
thinkin'
that
mi
casa
es
su
casa
Yeah,
you're
a
cute
fox
Perfect
ten
so
back
that
up
like
a
moonwalk
Girl,
you're
smokin'
like
Snoop
Dogg
But
you
must
be
tokin'
if
you
think
you're
takin'
over
my
quarters
There
goes
the
dime
into
the
jukebox
Two
shots
of
blue
Hpnotiq
and
soon
I'll
Turn
this
pool
hall
to
a
barroom
brawl
So,
Rick,
scratch
on
the
break
like
the
cue
ball
Turn
the
volume
all
the
way
up
on
your
boombox
And
excuse
the
locker
room
talk,
I'm
just
too
raw
But
apparently,
so
are
you,
ma
'Cause
you
just
kicked
me
in
the
balls
and
told
me
to
screw
off
And
that's
why—
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me
(Yeah,
me)
I
said
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me,
nasty
(Yeah,
me)
Said
"Can
I
take
you
home,
where
we
can
be
alone?"
Shorty,
you
the
shit,
girl,
I
ordered
you
to
sit
I
know
you're
probably
feelin'
me
more
than
you
admit
Pull
up
a
chair,
sweetie,
let
me
order
you
a
drink
I
only
go
to
meetings
court-ordered
from
a
shrink
So
from
the
bottom
to
the
top,
floor
to
ceilin'
You
ain't
run
of
the
mill,
you're
one
in
a
million
'Cause
real
tits
are
still
fun
But
everybody
knows
fake
tits
are
still
better
than
real
ones
So
come
and
spend
the
night
with
the
guy
most
are
terrified
of
But
tonight,
curiosity
overrides
ya
Beside
ya
fired
up
like
a
starter
pistol
Crystal,
let's
slide
hon,
tonight
I'm
your
pilot
'Cause
you
should
be
up
in
the
sky,
girl
You're
so
fucking
fly,
you
belong
in
the
mile
high
club
So
come
on,
baby,
the
night's
young
Don't
string
me
along,
I'm
high-strung
We
might
wind
up
on
mound
like
we're
tryin'
for
the
Cy
Young
Fuckin'
'fore
we
get
to
the
house
Screwin'
our
brains
out
like
changing
a
lightbulb
That's
why
I
like
ya,
'cause
I'm
crazy
just
like
ya
Now
every
time
I
get
brain,
you
screw
mine
up
I
barely
can
think
straight,
your
head
game
is
a
mindfuck
So
ready,
set,
aim
and
fire
Yes,
babe,
I’m
fallin'
in
like,
that's
kinda,
why
I
love
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me
(Yeah
me)
I
said
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me,
nasty
(Yeah,
me)
I've
drowned
in
high
from
the
ashes
Now
I
can't
recall
your
laughter
The
smoke
of
everything
go
grasp
At
ends
of
what's
left
over
And
the
lights
in
every
broken
Blown-out
window
screaming,
laughing
I
hope
to
feel
it
coursing
out
This
is
our
revival
Yeah,
shout
to
everybody
Who's
been
on
this
trip
with
me
You
don't
have
to,
agree
But
if
you
feel
like
me
Someone
get
this
Aryan
a
sheet
Time
to
bury
him,
so
tell
him
to
prepare
to
get
impeached
Everybody
on
your
feet
This
is
where
terrorism
and
heroism
meet,
square
off
in
the
street
This
chump
barely
even
sleeps
All
he
does
is
watch
Fox
News
like
a
parrot
and
repeats
While
he
looks
like
a
canary
with
a
beak
Why
you
think
he
banned
transgenders
from
the
military
with
a
tweet?
He's
tryin'
to
divide
us
This
shit's
like
a
cult,
but
like
Johnny
he'll
only
unite
us
'Cause
nothin'
inside
us
drives
us
like
this
fight
does
Similar
to
when
two
cars
collide
'cause
Our
spirit's
crushed,
and
this
spot's
a
tight
one
But
here
the
jaws
of
life
come
To
pull
us
from
the
wreckage,
that's
what
we
get
pride
from
When
we
can’t
from
our
stars
and
stripes
cause
This
type
of
pickle
that
we're
in
is
hard
to
deal
But
there's
always
tomorrow
still
If
we
start
from
scratch
like
a
scab,
get
the
scars
to
heal
And
band
together
for
Charlottesville
And
for
Heather,
fallen
heroes,
fill
this
wall
with
murals
Nevada
get
up,
hit
the
damn
resetter
Let's
start
from
zero,
this
is
our
renewal
Spray
tan,
get
rid
of,
get
a
brand
new,
better
America,
and
here's
to
where
it
all
And
here's
to
where
we
all
began,
all
began
(Stand
up!)
Here's
to
the
land
that
made
me
And
made
me
who
I
am,
who
I
am
(Hands
up!)
Here's
to
the
land
that
raised
me
This
one
for
the
only
place
that
really
knows
me
For
the
cracks
in
the
road
that
drove
me
There's
no
place
like
home
Didn't
wanna
piss
your
base
off,
did
ya?
Can't
denounce
the
Klan,
'cause
they
play
golf
with
ya
You
stay
on
Twitter,
way
to
get
your
hate
off
Nazi,
I
do
not
see
a
way
y'all
differ
And
all
you
got
are
race
cards,
bigot
The
swastika
with
your
name
carved
in
it
Should
be
your
trademark,
'cause
hate's
all
you
played
off
And
you
just
lick
the
plate
off
So
I
guess
it
pays
to
feed
off
of
chaos
So
basically,
you
ate
off
Hitler!
But
you
ain't
ruinin'
our
country,
punk
Or
takin'
our
pride
from
us,
you
won't
define
us
'Cause
like
a
dictionary,
things
are
lookin'
up
So
much,
got
a
sprained
neck,
know
we
would
rise
up
Against
this
train
wreck
and
take
a
stand
Even
if
it
means
sittin'
when
they
raise
the
flag
To
sing
"The
Star-Spangled
Banner"
This
man
just
praised
a
statue
of
General
Lee
'Cause
he
generally
hates
the
black
people,
degrades
hispanics
Take
it
back
to
the
Shady
national
convention
Wish
I
woulda
spit
on
it
before
I
went
to
shake
his
hand
At
the
event
or
maybe
had
the
wherewithal
To
know
that
he
was
gonna
try
to
tear
apart
Our
sacred
land
we
cherish
and
stand
for
So,
hands
in
the
air,
let's
hear
it
for
The
start
of
a
brand
new
America
Without
him
and
be
proud
of
where
we're
from
And
here's
to
where
we
all
And
here's
to
where
we
all
began,
all
began
(Stand
up!)
Here's
to
the
land
that
made
me
And
made
me
who
I
am,
who
I
am
(Hands
up!)
Here's
to
the
land
that
raised
me
This
one
for
the
only
place
that
really
knows
me
For
the
cracks
in
the
road
that
drove
me
There's
no
place
like
home
I
won't
give
up
I
won't
give
up
on
my
home,
that
so
many
died
for
You
already
know
that
I
won't
give
up
I
won't
give
up
on
my
home,
that
so
many
died
for
You
already
know
There's
no
place
like
home,
no
place
like
home
Wherever
I
go,
no
place
like
home
No
place
like
home,
no
place
like
home
Wherever
I
go
(Yeah)
And
here's
to
where
we
all
began,
all
began
(Stand
up!)
Here's
to
the
land
that
made
me
And
made
me
who
I
am,
who
I
am
(Hands
up!)
Here's
to
the
land
that
raised
me
This
one
for
the
only
place
that
really
knows
me
For
the
cracks
in
the
road
that
drove
me
There's
no
place
like
home
We
never
saw
from
each
other's
sides,
or
eye
to
eye
Just
eye
for
eye,
lie
for
lie,
fight
or
flight
So
much
baggage,
need
a
luggage
rack
But
we
carry
on
with
our
public
spats
and
our
feuds
Up
back
in
the
news,
love
taps
when
I
dissed
you
Like
it
was
fun,
actually
used
to
run
back
to
the
booth
Jump
back
in
the
studio,
give
you
a
tongue-lashing,
then
you
Laughed
at
the
stomach
tat
with
the
tombstone
It
was
funny
back
in
our
youth
But
then
it
wasn’t
after
we
knew
That
we
were
done
and
actually
through
(And
actually
through)
But
if
there's
one
fraction
of
truth
If
it
could
be
spun
back
I
would
do
So
many
things
different
(Things
different)
'Cause
it
was
such
a
dumbass
excuse
You
hit
me
once
and
that
I
would
use
To
continue
the
pattern
of
abuse
Why
did
I
punch
back?
Girls,
your
dad
is
a
scumbag,
I’m
confused
Because—
How
come
you
can
be
a
lord
and
a
loser?
How
come,
how
come,
you
can
be
a
liar
and
a
good
father?
A
good
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
Why
are
you
a
good
father?
A
great
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
You
were
the
beat
I
loved
with
a
writer's
block
The
line
that's
hot,
that
I
forgot
We
laughed
a
little,
cried
a
lot
I'll
never
forget
when
you
came
home
and
you
held
Hailie
Day
before
you
went
to
jail
and
daily
How
we'd
wait
for
that
mail
lady
Or
by
the
phone
for
Mom
to
call
And
I
watched
you
pull
yourself
up
and
we
decided
on
Givin'
it
one
more
try
despite
it
all
You're
my
lightning
rod
when
my
sky
gets
dark
I'm
your
shiny
rocks
in
that
tiny
box
When
we
tied
the
knot,
when
we
broke
the
knot
Every
line
we
crossed
we
were
supposed
to
not
Every
time
we
fought,
the
insults
they
got…
thrown
too
far
Words
that
we
said
that
we
didn’t
mean
The
words
that
we
meant
that
we
didn’t
say
The
ones
that
we
thought
that
we
shoulda
said
Letters
written
that
we
coulda
read
Which
maybe
woulda
led
to
some
good
instead
And
had
this
put
to
bed
But
I'd
be
lyin’
still
if
I
said
I
wasn't
sittin'
here
askin'
myself—
How
come
you
can
be
a
lord
and
a
loser?
How
come,
how
come,
you
can
be
a
liar
and
a
good
father?
A
good
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
Why
are
you
a
good
father?
A
great
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
(Dad)
(You
said)
Forever
be
a
hero
in
my
eyes
(I
reply)
But
there’s
always
another
side
to
a
good
father
A
great
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
We
brought
out
the
worst
in
each
other
Someone
had
to
make
the
sparring
end
'Cause
I
loved
you,
but
I
hated
that
me
And
I
don't
wanna
see
that
side
again
But
I'm
sorry,
Kim
More
than
you
could
ever
comprehend
Leavin'
you
was
fuckin'
harder
than
Sawing
off
a
fuckin'
body
limb
Once
upon
a
time
we're
all
we
had
Maybe
that's
what
drew
us
To
each
other,
it
was
true
love
Shit,
we
never
knew
was
possible
We
might
have
loved
each
other
too
much
And
maybe
that's
what
made
us
do
what
We
did
to
each
other,
all
the
screw-ups
'Cause
you
always
thought
that
you
was
More
in
love
with
me
And
I
was
thinkin'
I
was
more
in
love
than
you
was
For
all
the
times
that
we
thought
it
worked
'Til
we
saw
how
wrong
we
were
When
the
dust
settles
now
and
all
the
dirt
If
I
touch
the
rawest
nerve
All
I
want
is
for
us
not
to
hurt
And
it's
been
an
exhaustive
search
to
find
the
words
But
I
just
heard
"Mockingbird"
And
got
the
urge
to
jot
some
verses
and
thoughts
The
purpose
was
not
to
stir
up
or
open
wounds
I've
caused
a
few
and
so
have
you
Or
argue
whose
fault
it
was
Partly
yours,
partly
mine,
but
really
no
one's
This
is
so
tough,
I'm
gettin'
choked
up
Oh
fuck
it,
we
both
suck
We
broke
up,
got
back
together
We
both
thought
we
had
forever
Not
bad
people,
just
bad
together
We
were
so
nuts,
backstabbed
each
other
Another
blow
struck,
but
there's
no
duckin'
this
blow
'Cause
it's
over
and
it's
closure
But
I'm
not
so
sure
how
to
close
this
I
just
don't
know
how
some
people
can
be
so
good
At
one
thing
and
so
fucked
at
a
whole
'nother
Shit,
it's
no
wonder!
How
come,
how
come,
you
can
be
a
lord
and
a
loser?
How
come,
how
come,
you
can
be
a
liar
and
a
good
father?
A
good
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
Why
are
you
a
good
father?
A
great
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
(Dad)
(You
said)
Forever
be
a
hero
in
my
eyes
(I
reply)
But
there's
always
another
side
to
a
good
father
A
great
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
I'm
stumbling,
I
can’t
see
straight
And
it's
my
fault
I
got
this
way
I
got
my
hands
on
something
great
And
found
a
way
to
mess
it
up
I
did
my
best,
I
tried
to
change
But
it's
just
in
my
DNA
I
got
my
hands
on
something
great
And
found
a
way
to
fuck
it
up
again
Now
I’m
the
one
thing
you
couldn't
hate
more
But
you're
the
one
thing
that
I
would
die
for
All
my
life,
I
was
told,
I
was
never
nothing
special
I
don't
need
to
be
reminded
of
it
every
other
second
'Specially
when
all
my
self-esteem's
Already
shot
to
hell,
I'm
falling
helplessly
I'm
embarrassed,
I
don’t
want
no
one
else
to
see
’Cause
I
feel
like
I'm
a
piece
of
shit
every
time
she
yells
at
me
Selfishly
addicted,
definitely
doesn’t
help
that
she
Makes
me
feel
like
I've
died
and
gone
to
heaven
But
makes
life
a
living
hell
for
me
She
does
that
thing
with
her
lip,
now
she's
melting
me
I'm
putty
in
her
palms,
I’m
wrapped
around
her
finger
A
yo-yo
on
a
string,
she
lets
me
sit
there
and
just
dangle
Until
something
better
comes
along
And
she'll
just
drop
me
like
a
hot
potato
I
look
like
I'm
in
pain,
but
I'm
okay
though
'Cause
I
know
she
loves
me—my
friends,
what
do
they
know?
It's
like
I'm
drowning
at
sea
Hoping
that
you
reach
for
me
I
know
you're
there,
but
I
can't
see
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
I'm
dying
to
breathe
And
all
you
do
is
strangle
me
Such
a
beautiful
relief
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
(Drunk
off
tragic
endings)
In
my
moments
of
weakness
I
openly
admit
the
shit
I
wouldn't
normally
I'm
extremely
self-conscious
and
enormously
Insecure
and
she
uses
it
to
torture
when
she
torments
me
It
only
turns
to
ammunition
for
her
in
this
war,
when
she
Gets
goin'
she
don't
stop,
when
I'm
up
she's
like
a
downer
When
I
found
her
it
was
love
at
first
encounter
But,
somehow
she
musta
took
the
carton
of
eggs
off
the
counter
Cracked
them
and
placed
all
the
shells
on
the
ground
for
Me
to
walk
on
when
I'm
around
her
But
there's
just
something
about
her
That
makes
me
not
able
to
function
without
her
How
can
I
get
out
of
it
when
I
don't
know
how
to?
I'm
a
doubter,
I'm
a
pessimist,
make
a
believer
out
of
me
And
show
me
the
way
now
or
stay
the
fuck
out
of
my
cloud
of
rain
'Cause
I'm
going
straight
down
the
drain,
I'm
drowning
It's
like
I'm
drowning
at
sea
Hoping
that
you
reach
for
me
I
know
you're
there,
but
I
can't
see
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
I'm
dying
to
breathe
And
all
you
do
is
strangle
me
Such
a
beautiful
relief
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
(Drunk
off
tragic
endings)
Now
I'm
the
one
thing
you
couldn't
hate
more
But
you're
the
one
thing
that
I
would
die
for
It
took
a
while
for
me
to
get
it,
but
I
think
I've
figured
it
out
She
don't
want
me,
she
just
don't
wanna
see
me
with
someone
else
The
idea
of
seeing
me
happy
destroys
her
in
itself
To
see
me
falling
to
pieces
brings
her
joy
and
brings
her
health
But
it
annoys
her
to
see
me
get
the
strength
to
say,
"Screw
her!"
I
threw
up
on
myself,
I'm
dumb
sick,
I'm
addicted
to
her
She's
tryna
block
the
door,
so
here's
how
I
do
her
Since
I'm
manure,
she's
a
sewer
And
this
time
this
piece
of
shit's
running
through
her
I
can
see
the
light,
now
I'm
running
to
it
What
the
fuck?
Shoulda
knew
it!
Who
would
think
she'd
actually
have
the
balls
to
do
it?
As
soon
as
I
hopped
in
it,
she
doused
the
car
with
lighter
fluid
She's
standing
there
with
a
rag,
'bout
to
put
the
lighter
to
it
Lit
the
fucking
thing
on
fire,
then
she
threw
it
It's
like
I'm
drowning
at
sea
Hoping
that
you
reach
for
me
I
know
you're
there,
but
I
can't
see
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
I'm
dying
to
breathe
And
all
you
do
is
strangle
me
Such
a
beautiful
relief
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
(Drunk
off
tragic
endings)
Feeling
kinky,
lip
syncing
to
Too
$hort's
"Freaky
Tales"
(Biatch!)
Having
creepy
visions
of
whiskey
drinking
And
envisioning
sneaking
into
where
Christie
Brinkley
dwells
I
know
this
is
risky
thinking
but
I
wanna
stick
her
like
she's
decals
But
when
murdering
females
Better
pay
attention
to
these
details
or
you
could
be
derailed
Better
wear
at
least
three
layers
of
clothing
or
be
in
jail
If
you
get
scratched
because
your
DNA'll
Be
all
up
under
her
fingernails
Man,
he
hears
you,
I
don't
think
he
cares
He
gives
a
fuck,
even
his
pinky
swears
Three
personalities
burstin'
out
of
me,
please
beware
Her
TV
blares,
can't
hear
the
creaking
stairs
She's
unaware
in
no
underwear,
she's
completely
bare
Turns
around
and
screams,
I
remember
distinctly
I
said
"I'm
here
to
do
sink
repairs."
Chop
her
up,
put
her
body
parts
In
front
of
Steven
Avery's
trailer
and
leave
'em
there
But
hey
man,
I
was
framed
I
know
what
this
looks
like,
officers
Please
just
give
me
one
minute
I
think
I
can
explain
I
ain't
murdered
nobody
I
know
these
words
are
so
nutty
But
I'm
just
here
to
entertain
How
come
your
shirt
is
so
bloody?
There's
a
missing
person,
so
what?
He's
Got
nothin'
to
do
with
me
I'm
almost
certain
I
was
framed
Woke
up,
it
was
dawn,
musta
knew
somethin'
was
wrong
Think
I'm
becomin'
a
monster
'cause
of
the
drugs
that
I'm
on
Donald
Duck's
on,
there's
a
Tonka
Truck
in
the
yard
But
dog,
how
the
fuck
is
Ivanka
Trump
in
the
trunk
of
my
car?
Gotta
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
to
try
to
solve
it
Must
go
above
and
beyond,
'cause
it's
incumbent
upon
me
Plus
I
feel
somewhat
responsible
for
the
dumb
little
blonde
Girl,
that
motherfuckin'
baton
twirler
that
got
dumped
in
the
pond
Second
murder
with
no
recollection
of
it
Collectin'
newspaper
articles,
cuttin'
out
sections
from
it
Memory's
too
fucked
to
remember,

Cut
my

then
stuck

up
in

Another
dismembered
toddler
discovered
this
winter
probably
'Cause
the
disassembled
body
Was
covered
up
in
the
snow
since
the
month
of
November
oddly
I'm
wanted
for
questioning
Them
son
of
a
bitches
probably
just
wanna
pin
this
on
me
But
hey

I
was

I

Still
on
the
loose,
they
Spotted
me
inside
McDonald's
Tuesday
In
a
Toronto
Blue
Jays
cap,
lookin'
like
your
college
roommate
With
Rihanna,

Saddam

Or
was
it
Cool

The

Just
escaped
from
the
state
pen
Don't
make
it
no
weirder,
I'm
naked
When
I
break
in
your
basement
Under
your
baby's
play
pen,
I
lay
in,
wait
adjacent
Facin'
the
door,
remainin'
patient
while
stayin'
complacent
Blatant
sexual
implications
are
continuin'
to
get
thrown
Insinuations
are
placed
in
little
riddles
and
poems
Left
on
your
pillow
in
hopes,
that
when
you
get
home
You'll
get
the
hint,
ho:
I'm
in
your
window
But
it
never
occurred
to
me
I
could
describe
a
murder
scene
In
a
verse
and
be
charged
with
first
degree
'Cause
it
just
happened
to
match
up
perfectly
With
the
massacre
or
the
Burger
King
burglary
No,
officer,
you
see
...
I
was
framed
I
know
what
this
looks

Please
just

Ashes
blowin'
in
the
air
Our
world’s
on
fire,
but
we
don't
care,
yeah
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
lookin'
back
and
we’re
never
gettin'
old
'Cause
the
skies
are
black
But
our
heart's
made
of
gold
Fuck
doin'
what
you're
told
We're
goin'
nowhere
fast
I
feel
sorry
for
this
beat,
sympathy
pains
for
this
track
This
road
is
takin’
me
back
Down
memory
lane
with
this
rap
I
can
still
look
out
in
this
crowd,
be
wowed
and
be
taken
aback
I’m
simply
stating
a
fact
I
had
Wembley
Stadium
packed
But
now
we're
on
a
path
headed
to
nowhere
and
fast
Another
terrorist
attacks
Like
a
tariff,
blows
half
of
Madison
Square
up,
alas
We
perish
in
the
blast
But
that
isn’t
scaring
us,
we
pass
Nowhere
we're
fearless,
'cause
we're
just—
Ashes
blowin’
in
the
air
Our
world's
on
fire,
but
we
don't
care,
yeah
(We
don't
give
a…
no,
no)
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
lookin'
back
and
we're
never
gettin'
old
'Cause
the
skies
are
black
But
our
heart's
made
of
gold
(golden)
Fuck
doin'
what
you're
told
(what
we're
told)
We're
goin'
nowhere
fast
'Cause
we're
goin'
no,
goin'
no
Goin'
no,
goin'
no
Goin
no,
goin'
nowhere
We're
on
the
run
of
our
lives
Goin'
nowhere
fast
Fuck
doin'
what
you're
told,
act
like
a
two-year
old
Shit
is
soon
to
go
kaboom
and
blow
Anyways;
for
MC's
it's
a
funeral
When
I'm
devisin'
this
rhyme
'Cause
I'm
awake
and
you're
mourning
That's
why
I
rise
and
I
shine
Like
a
new
day
has
dawned
on
me
Gusto,
guts,
bravado
Nuts
and
plus
I
kick
up
dust
and
cuss
a
lot
I
musta
got
you
in
somewhat
of
a
debacle
'Cause
some
stuff
that's
awful
Really
don't
mean
nothin'
although
There's
a
lot
of
shit
I
said
in
jest
that's
tough
to
swallow
But
if
at
times
my
heart
it
seems
Like
it's
in
the
wrong
place,
it's
probably
'cause
it's
on
my
sleeve
Keanu
Reeves
speed
of
life,
avoid
or
veer
Or
just
steer
toward
it,
we're
only
lookin'
forward
But
where
we're
goin',
we
have
no
idea
Nowhere
to
go,
but
hysterical,
it's
gettin'
warm
in
here
I
set
the
world
on
fire,
was
born
to
be
an
arsonist
Just
one
spark
and
it's
lit
But
I'ma
still
get
dark
on
this
shit
Told
you
I'd
leave
my
mark
on
this
bitch—war
machine
But
you
forced
me
in
a
corner
I'm
sure
to
have
somethin'
for
your
rear
And
in
the
course
of
the
assault
as
torture
gets
more
severe
Go
to
war
with
me,
you'll
end
up
blew
to
Timbuktu
I
send
at
you
a
ten-ton
nuke
like
Kim
Jong-Un
And
end
up
ruinin'
your
career
But
when
all
is
said
and
done
And
at
the
end
of
my
run
I'll
just
rewind
clocks,
forever
young
Make
time
stop,
will
I
ever
fall
off?
That
day
will
never
come
'Til
the
pine
box,
bitch,
fuck
you!
I'm
better
than
I
ever
was
'Til
the
bomb
drops,
hope
it
never
does
But
I'm
not
gonna
sweat
it
'cause
This
world's
screwed,
it's
already
fucked
And
I'm
on
top,
so
everyone's
just—
Ashes
blowin'
in
the
air
(so
we're…)
Our
world's
on
fire,
but
we
don't
care,
yeah
(We
don't
give
a…
no,
no)
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
lookin'
back
and
we're
never
gettin'
old
'Cause
the
skies
are
black
But
our
heart's
made
of
gold
(golden)
Fuck
doin'
what
you're
told
(what
we're
told)
We're
goin'
nowhere
fast
'Cause
we're
goin'
no,
goin'
no
Goin'
no,
goin'
no
Goin'
no,
goin'
nowhere
We're
on
the
run
of
our
lives
Goin'
nowhere
fast
You
can't
tell
us
nothin'
Hard-headed
and
we're
stubborn
So,
one
ear
and
out
the
other
when
we're
young,
we're
young
(We're
on
the
run
of
our
lives)
Who
knows
what
the
future
for
us
could
hold
Another
shooter?
Uh
oh
(We're
on
the
run
of
our
lives)
No
more
tomorrows,
we're
done
And
all
we
are
is—
Ashes
blowin'
in
the
air
(so
we're…)
Our
world's
on
fire,
but
we
don't
care
(don't
care,
yeah)
(We
don't
give
a…
no,
no)
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
lookin'
back
and
we're
never
gettin'
old
'Cause
the

But
our

(golden)
Fuck
doin'
what
you're
told
(what
we're

We're
goin'
nowhere
fast
'Cause
we're
goin'
no,
goin'
no
Goin'
no,
goin'
no
Goin'
no,
goin'
nowhere
We're
on
the
run
of
our

Goin'
nowhere
fast
Wanna
take
it
from
the
top?
Lady,
you
remind
me
of
my
raps
on
that
Relapse
shit
'Cause
you
got
an
ass
thick
as
them
accents
Two
ass-cheek
implants,
call
that
an
asset
'Cause
you
could
set
a
glass
on
it,
it's
massive
From
the
first
time
I
saw
you,
I
actually
Said
to
myself:
"I
gotta
meet
her"
like
a
taxi
Exactly,
love
affair
in
the
backseat
Sorry
if
I'm
being
graphic
But
I'm
stiff
as
a
statue
you
sat
on
a
shelf
I
feel
like
I'ma
bust,
maybe
I'm
just
ahead
of
myself
Let
me
slow
down,
slow
your
Camaro
I'm
tryna
catch
up,
I'm
tryna
jump
your
bones
to
the
marrow
Got
me
under
your
control
and
your
spell
Wanna
wrap
you
up,
put
you
in
a
bow
like
an
arrow
Grab
you
by
the
(Meow!),
hope
it's
not
a
problem,
in
fact
About
the
only
thing
I
agree
on
with
Donald
is
that
So
when
I
put
this
palm
on
your
cat
Don't
snap,
it's
supposed
to
get
grabbed
Why
you
think
they
call
it
a
snatch?
I
just
wanna
climb
in
the
sack
I'ma
keep
it
a
hundred
like
my
speedometer's
at
I'm
watchin'
you
rap,
I'm
the
dude
followin'
back
About
six
cars,
I'm
in
the
'lac,
and
I
wanna
fack
All
day,
all
day,
all
night
You
ask,
I'll
stay
the
night
With
you,
you
say
you're
fire
Me
too,
you're
burning
up
I
want
it—
All
day,
all
night
You
feel,
my
heat
(fire)
Feel,
feel,
feel,
feel,
feel
My
heat
Hate
to
inconvenience
you
at
the
convenience
store
But
them
jeans
you
wore
are
like
I've
never
seen
before
I
pretend
I
work
there
while
I
clean
the
floor
Checkin'
you
out
like
the
clerk
while
he
rings
you
up
Pull
out
behind
you
when
you're
leavin'
And
you
don't
even
know
it
(word,
yo
Rick,
man!)
She's
brushin'
her
hair,
adjustin'
her
mirror
She's
rappin'
my
shit,
but
she
wasn't
aware
I
was
there,
or
maybe
she
was
and
just
didn't
care
Who
knows?
At
least
that
ain't
up
in
the
air
for
some
to
see
So
like
a
chick
who
thinks
her
coochie
don't
stink
If
she
ain't
plannin'
to
do
shit
this
summer's
eve
Maybe
she
wants
to
keep
me
company
But
fuck
the
Pepé
Le
Pew
shit!
"Ain't
steppin'
to
you,
bitch,"
I
say
to
myself
Plus
she's
bumpin'
my
music,
ain't
chasin'
no
tail
like
a
skunk
in
heat
I
could
sweat
her
to
some
degree
But
fuck
it,
I'm
the
male,
let
her
come
to
me
(Could
you
repeat
that
again?)
Fuck
it,
pull
up
beside
her
Sideswipe
her
Dodge
Viper,
wood
is
so
bright
I
ask
does
she
want
a
computer
lodged
in
her
vagina
Said
my
dick
is
an
apple,
she
said
put
it
inside
her
I
said—
All
day,
all
day,
all
night
You
ask,
I'll
stay
the
night
With
you,
you
say
you're
fire
Me
too,
you're
burning
up
I
want
it—
All
day,
all
night
You
feel,
my
heat
(fire)
Feel,
feel,
feel,
feel,
feel
My
heat
Black
out,
come
to,
hands
covered
in
blood
Motherfuckin'
gloves
and
a
shovel
stuck
in
the
mud
I
just
bodied
the
beat,
so
that
hole
musta
been
dug
'Cause
it
just
died
like
food
coloring
(duh!)
So
let's
get
turnt
like
a
shish
kabab
Twist
it,
ma,
like
an
air-conditioning
knob
We'd
be
great
together
Don't
care
if
it
takes
forever
If
I
gotta
wait,
I
guess
it's
better
late
than
never
You
felt
my
heat
rubbin'
off
on
ya
I
love
your
personality,
come
on,
little
mama
You're
hot
enough
to
melt
Rick's
beat,
come
jump
in
the
water
I
bet
you
get
your
self-esteem
from
your
persona
With
an
ass
to
match,
girl,
your
Body
is
lit,
you're
striking,
I'm
a
gas,
girl,
you're
Just
gonna
have
to
put
them
other
chumps
on
the
back
burner
You
got
buns,
I
got
Asperger's
Just
let
me
rest
my
head
between
that
set
of
D's
While
I
shred
MC's
like
cheddar
cheese
That's
just
the
thoroughbred
in
me,
ain't
a
better
breed
My
dog
thinks
so
too—look
at
my
pedigree!
(Roof!)
Ma,
the
world
is
what
I
think
of
you
I
think
you're
divine,
so
I
might
swing
on
you
I'm
just
kiddin',
girl,
I
wouldn't
lift
a
finger,
too
Unless
it's
the
middle
one
to
finger
you
All
day,
all
day,
all
night
You
ask,
I'll
stay
the
night
With
you,
you
say
you're
fire
Me
too,
you're
burning
up
I
want
it—
Feel,
feel,
feel,
feel,
feel
My
heat
On
the
ones
and
twos,
to
three
or
four
in
the
mornin'
Rick's
on
the
cut
like
Neosporin
(Girls!)
He's
mixin'
it
up
for
me,
and
you're
in
A
teddy
like
short
for
Theodore
We're
outtie,
five
thousand
I
wanna
fuck,
it's
my
big
dick
So
everybody
get
ready
fucking
now!
You
claim
if
you
get
knocked
by
the
cops
You'll
give
'em
not
even
a
statement
Walk
in
the
arraignment
Shoot
the
bailiff,
karate
kick
the
plaintiff
Gotti
with
the
stainless
I'll
just
call
it
shoddy
entertainment
If
y'all
was
in
the
party
gettin'
faded
On
molly,
had
the
audience
sedated
You
wouldn't
catch
a
body
if
it
fainted
Probably
let
it
fall
and
hit
the
pavement
But
you'd
be
the
first
lobbyin'
to
claim
it
Bitch,
stop
bein'
a
lame
Your
hobby
isn’t
robbery
and
dismemberin'
body
limbs
Like
you
was
Tommy
Lynn
Sells
And
chainsawin'
them
in
the
basement
Hardly
fits
your
job
description
Ain't
nobody
dippin'
Out
the
back
of
the
club
like,
"Oh
my
God,
he's
trippin'!"
Only
time
you
get
the
blade
is
probably
with
the
dang
lawn
equipment,
ain't
it?
Wouldn't
take
a
bobby
pin
and
wave
it
I
need
to
stop
bein'
debated
You're
still
copyin',
Xeroxing,
I'm
still
coppin'
a
feel
Like
Bill
Cosby
at
will,
poppin'
a
pill
Then
spill
Oxys
in
Jill's
coffee
Then
send
her
out
to
the
hotel
lobby
a
lil'
wobbly
and
still
groggy
This
blonde
fuck's
reprehensible
Misconducts,
never
sensible
Kiss
my
butt,
my
set
of
principles
Is
gone,
but
'til
I
get
the
President
to
respond
My
pen
and
pencil
is
a
missile
launcher
And
send
it
to
Mitch
McConnell
Just
as
big
of
a
bitch
as
Donald—shit's
on,
bruh!
(Ha-ha)
Let
me
sing
this
shit
soprano
While
I
do
it
pizzicato
Ivanka,
stiff-arm
her
while
I'm
hittin'
on
Melania
And
this
song's
for
all
ya
'Cause
nobody
likes
me,
everybody
hates
me
They
want
me
to
go
eat
some
worms
(I
hope
you
offended)
And
drag
my
name
through
the
mud,
through
the
dirt
But
I'ma
make
you
eat
your
words
(I
hope
you
offended)
You
can
try
to
hold
me
down,
but
you
better
let
me
up
'Cause
you're
only
gonna
make
things
worse
(I
hope
you
offended)
'Cause
I
swear
when
I
get
up,
I'm
never
gonna
let
up
'Til
everybody
eats
my
turds
These
drums
and
hard
snares
bring
out
the
worst
in
me
Like
Justin
Ross
Harris
at
a
nursery
Goin'
ham
at
candy
yam
on
nanny
cam
I'm
gettin'
handies
with
the
zanny
Xannys
in
the
Caddy
armrest
I'm
imaginin'
objects
So
I'm
battin'
cobwebs
from
a
daddy
longleg
In
Hamtramck,
got
the
panoramic
camera
Xanax,
a
banana
hammock
and
a
Santa
hat
I'm
smellin'
like
a
damn
mechanic
With
a
chick
that
looks
like
Janet
Jackson
with
a
Spanish
accent
Twice
her
age
and
I'm
actin'
half
it
(Ha-ha)
Grow
up?
Nah,
not
that
I
know
of,
y'all
Basement
just
got
a
frickin'
overhaul
Got
a
stripper
pole
installed
Started
rollin'
all
through
those
Klonopins
like
a
bowlin'
ball
Like
an
overdose
on
twice
the
ratio
of
Propofol
And
go
through
no
withdrawal
While
I
get
fellatio
and
give
a
facial
to
An
interracial
blow-up
doll
of
Rachel
Dolezal
You're
so
appalled
(Em…),
so's
my
manager
Bitch,
I
am
mature,
fuck
a
pro
career
Coast
is
clear,
but
nowhere
to
go
from
here
And
nobody's
close
so
don't
compare
They
ain't
nowhere
near,
I'm
way
over
here
My
competition
can't
see
me—'cause
I
don't
own
a
mirror!
But,
Marshall,
you
are
terrific,
so
smart
and
gifted
I'm
so
narcissistic,
when
I
fart
I
sniff
it
Do
a
fake
dab
to
smell
my
armpits,
whiff
it
Your
anxiety's
throwin'
gang
signs
But
I
made
strides
with
these
rape
lines
I'm
cuttin'
back
on
women
hate
crimes
Like
Ray
Rice
when

FaceTimes
Bang,
bang,
bang,

Dang

You're

sutures
the
same
size
As
the

I
push
into
caput'cha
When
I
pull
'em
like

sleigh
rides
Gotta
stab
a
bitch
at
least
eight
times
to
make
it
on
Dateline
I
came
to
stake
my
claim
like
a
canine
waitin'
in
a
buffet
line
So,
Kellyanne
Conway,
I'm
a
really
bad
hombre
Come
play,
belly
dance
on
me
I've
been
makin'
wedding
plans
all
day
'Cause
nobody
likes
me,
everybody
hates
me
They
want
me
to
go
eat
some
worms
(I
hope
you
offended)
And
drag
my
name
through
the
mud,
through
the

But
I'ma
make
you
eat
your

You
can
try
to
hold

but
you
better
let
me
up
'Cause
you're
only
gonna
make
things

(I
hope
you

'Cause
I
swear
when
I
get
up,
I'm
never
gonna

'Til
everybody

Eight-year-old

Girl,
take
this
pole
like
a
survey
Today
wasn't
my
birthday
But
I'm
caked
up
like
a
dessert
tray
So
we're
in
shape,
'cause
you're
in
a
slurrin'
state
I’m
a
ten,
you’re
an
eight
(Urinate)
Like
what
I
do
before,
after,
and
durin'
rape!
You
wanna
get
into
a
pissin'
contest
and
find
out
who's
better?
And
be
made
a
fool
out
of
when
I
pull
on
'em?

Non-high
school
grad,
I'm
not
a
scholar
But
I'm
so
cold
when
I'm
droppin'
knowledge
My
degrees
is
the
same
as
I
got
in
college
(Zero)
But
nobody's
hotter,
you
owe
me
my
respect
I
owe
you
nada
like
Haloti,
partner
Blow
me,
told
you
I'm
so
dirty,
homie
You
can
throw
me
in
some
holy
water
With
some
floaties
on
and
get
the
soap
and
try
to
Get
the
Pope
to
hold
me
while
you
hose
me
off
And
nope,
I
won't
be
washed
Hope
to
God
I
don't
explode
I
gotta
blow
this
spot
up
though,
I
got
a
lotta
mo'
I
won't
put
the
sugar
coating
on
it
though
'Cause
sometimes
you
can
feel
like
your
energy's
expired
Rap's
got
you
drained,
dead
tired,
zapped
You
feel
like
a
wet
pile
of
crap
But
look,
man,
like
the
feds
buggin'
my
phone
(Uh-huh)
I
get
why
you're
tapped
"But
you
gotta
get
your
fire
back
Catch
fire,
get
upset
and
fire
back!"
Is
what
I
tell
myself
when
times
get
bad
'Cause
sometimes
I
might
get
sad
But
I
take
the
same
advice
I
had
And
tell
myself
like
I
used
to
tell
Hailie
when
life's
a
drag
Told
her
to
do
like
her
dad:
don't
cry,
get
mad!
'Cause
little
baby
powders
belong
in
diaper
bags
I'm
hyper,
by
the
time
you
see
this
side
of
me
I'm
right
in
your
ass
(Sodomy!)
Foot
up
it,
I
stood
up
for
the
kid
Who
had
to
put
up
with
the
bullies
at
his
school
(At
his
school)
You
ain't
had
to
have
no
money
Or
go
shoppin'
just
to
cop
a
fuckin'
attitude
(Attitude)
Now
my
dough's
amountin'
to
a
mountain
That's
rised
too
high
to
count
it
Never
asked
to
be
rich,
all
I
did
was
wish
I
had
a
dime
for
every
time
that
I
was
doubted
But
then
I
think
about
it,
then
I'm
enraged
'Cause
I
just
figured
out
that
if
I
was
paid
For
the
time
I
spent
to
put
the
pen
to
the
page
It'd
be
minimum
wage
(Minimum
wage)
But
it's
embedded
in
my
head
I
never
Hunted
for
the
bread
and
butter
What
I
wanted
was
to
be
the
one
that
they
was
scared
of
but
I'm
never
gonna
get
the
credit
for
the
sweat
and
blood
I
put
up
in
the
pen,
and
when
I'm
dead
I
wonder
Will
they
put
me
on
a
pedestal
Or
forget
I
was
ever
this
incredible?
I
guess
I
better
go
harder
than
ever
'cause
I'll
never
get
another
motherfuckin'
opportunity
again
To
offend
as
many
people
with
this,
I
can
simply
because
I
can
'Cause
nobody
likes
me,
everybody
hates
me
They
want
me
to
go
eat
some
worms
(I
hope
you
offended)
And
drag
my
name
through
the
mud,
through
the
dirt
But
I'ma
make
you
eat
your
words
(I
hope
you
offended)
You
can
try
to
hold
me
down,
but
you
better
let
me
up
'Cause
you're
only
gonna
make
things
worse
(I
hope
you
offended)
'Cause
I
swear
when
I
get
up,
I'm
never
gonna
let
up
'Til
everybody
eats
my
turds
You're
drunk,
the
carpet
is
burned
I
hate
to
find
you
like
this
I
always
find
you
like
this
I
come
home
and
clean
up
your
mess
What
would
you
do
without
that?
Why
do
I
always
come
back?
Oh,
what
I
wouldn't
do
for
you!
And
I'm
startin'
to
think
that
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
And
I'm
startin'
to
think
that
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Some
nights
I
want
to
run
for
the
hills
It's
never
easy
with
you
I
cannot
reason
with
you
But
your
smile
is
as
rare
as
it
comes
What
would
I
do
without
that?
Maybe
that's
why
I
come
back
Oh,
what
I
wouldn't
do
for
you!
And
I'm
startin'
to
think
that
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
And
I'm
startin'
to
think
that
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Startin'
to
think
we
were
made
for
each
other
But
one
of
us
in
this
relationship
is
raisin'
the
other
You
remind
me
of
my
mother
We
drive
one
another
crazy
as
each
other
And
we're
both
adults,
so
there's
no
excuse
For
the
games
that
we
play
with
each
other
Where
you
at?
At
a
friend's?
No,
you
ain't,
mothafucker!
But
I
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
Whenever
the
doubt
kicks
in,
shiver
when
I
touch
her
'Cause
I
love
her
so
much,
I'm
a
sucker
How
her
bottom
lip
can
quiver
when
she's
in
trouble
She's
in
hot
water,
think
I
caught
her
cheatin'
again
Give
her
another
chance?
Another
one
after
that?
I'm
swimmin'
in
that
Egyptian
river,
'cause
I'm
in
denial
Say
I
don't
eat
shit,
but
I
got
a
shit-eatin'
grin
when
I
smile
Makin'
an
excuse
for
us
to
act
it
out
She's
just
actin'
out
with
her
inner
child
Then
I
set
the
truth
on
fire
'Cause
I'd
rather
believe
a
lie
Then
I
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief,
I
don't
believe
in
Goin'
to
bed
mad,
I
keep
on
tryin'
To
make
a
bad
girl
good
But
haven't
I
stood
by
you
in
good
times?
And
bad?
I'm
startin'
to
feel
like
your
goddamn
dad
'Cause
I
literally
feel
like
you
could
die
if
ever
should
I
Leave
you
for
good
and
never
would
I
It'd
be
all
bad,
never
understood
why
they
call
it
goodbye
But
I
think
I'm
a
pretty
damn
good
guy
And
you're
a
good
person
too
I
can
save
you,
I
can
make
you
change
But
I
keep
puttin'
my
fuckin'
foot
in
my
mouth
Every
time
I
gotta
come
and
bail
you
out
When
you
get
in
trouble
that
you
get
yourself
in
And
I'm
in
trouble,
but
I
can't
leave,
I'll
sell
you
out
I
could
never
turn
my
fuckin'
back
on
you—what
is
that?
I'm
co-dependent,
I'm
just
now
noticin'
it
But
somehow
it's
like
every
time
I'm
about
to
go
to
end
it
I
ain't
got
the
cojones
to
do
it,
nor
the
heart
Our
apartment's
tore
apart
You're
usin'
my
heart
for
a
dartboard
But
God
must've
aligned
stars
for
us
'Cause
somebody
paired
us
up
And
they
say
He
ain't
capable
of
makin'
a
mistake
But
this
one's
perfect,
'cause
I'm—
I'm
startin'
to
think
that
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
And
I'm
startin'
to
think
that
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
What's
in
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie
What's
in
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie,
oh
I'm
packin'
up
my
shit,
as
much
shit
in
the
car
as
I
can
fit
And
I'm
just
drivin'
as
far
as
I
can
get
Away
from
these
problems
'til
all
of
my
sorrows
I
forget
What's
tomorrow
like?
'Cause
tonight
I'm
startin'
life
again
Get
to
the
corner
and
stop,
fuck
am
I
goin'?
Besides
psycho
when
I
fantasize
startin'
my
whole
life
over
Yeah
right,
oh
and
I
might
go
and
Get
hypnotized
so
I
don't
even
recognize
no
one
I
try
to
look
alive
but
there's
nothin'
like
holdin'
Your
head
up
high
when
you're
dead
inside
and
I
just
hide,
so
in
Case
you're
wonderin'
why
are
my
insides
showin'
'Cause
I
done
spilled
all
my
guts
and
those
are
mine,
so
I'm
Pickin'
'em
up
and
stuffin'
'em
back
Fuck
it,
I've
done
enough
in
this
rap
shit
Recovery
brought
me
nothin'
but
back
To
right
where
I
was
and
perhaps
This
coulda
been
my
victory
lap,
if
I
wasn't
on
the
verge
of
relapse
What's
in
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie
What's
in
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie,
oh
It
seems
to
be
the
reoccurring
main
theme
The
shit
I
would
daydream
as
a
kid,
I
was
eighteen
I
went
from
an
irate
teenager
to
still
raging
As
an
adult,
amazing:
back
then
I
put
anything
Into
the
rhyme,
whether
it
was
sad,
mad,
happy
or
angry
I
spit
it,
the
mainstream,
I
hit
it
Yay
me,
I
did
it!
…Did
what?
Hailie,
baby,
I
didn't
mean
to
make
you
eighty
Percent
of
what
I
rapped
about
Maybe
I
shoulda
did
a
better
job
at
separating
Shady
and
entertaining
from
real
life
But
this
fame
thing
is
still
the
hardest
thing
to
explain
It's
the
craziest
shit
I
Ever
seen,
and
back
then
it
was
like
I
ain't
even
Bothered
taking
into
consideration
You
one
day
being
older
and
may
hear
me
say
things
I
didn’t
(A)
mean
and
(B)
just
ain’t
me
Okay,
so
ladies
and
gentlemen
Let's
strip
away
everything
and
see
the
main
reason
that
I
Feel
like
a
lame
piece
of
shit,
I
sound
cranky
and
bitter
Complain,
beef
and
bicker
'bout
the
same
things
'Cause
when
I
look
at
me,
I
don't
see
what
they
see
I
feel
ashamed,
greedy
And
lately
I've
been
contemplating
Escaping
to
get
away
and
go
wherever
this
road
takes
me
It's
making
me
crazy,
what's
in
my—
What's
in
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie
What's
in
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie,
oh
I
built
this
castle
Now
we
are
trapped
on
the
throne
I'm
sorry
we’re
alone
I
wrote
my
chapter
You'll
turn
the
page
when
I'm
gone
I
hope
you’ll
sing
along
This
is
your
song
I
just
want
you
to
know
that
I
ain't
scared
Whatever
it
takes
to
raise
you,
I'm
prepared
To
do
whatever,
to
do
whatever
December
1st,
1995,
dear
Hailie
This
is
your
song
You'll
be
coming
out
of
Mommy's
stomach
soon
I
better
do
something
quick
if
I'ma
be
able
to
support
you
I
can
barely
support
me,
but
as
long
as
you're
healthy
That's
all
that
matters
for
the
time
being
But
obviously
assuming
you
will
be
Just
thinking
ahead,
I’ma
make
it
if
it
kills
me
Let’s
see
how
far
I
can
take
it
with
this
music
I'm
getting
sick
of
chasing
this
illusion
(ha!)
Sorry
for
sloppy
writing
The
pen
in
my
hand
is
shaking,
please
excuse
me
Dad’s
a
little
nervous,
but
at
the
same
time
excited
If
I
use
this
same
energy
while
I'm
saying
rhymes
and
write
them
With
the
same
passion
and
the
same
exact
enthusiasm
As
I'm
using
in
this
letter,
maybe
they
can
feel
me
as
I'm
Trying
to
build
these
castles
out
of
sand,
baby
girl
For
you
to
sit
on
the
throne,
I
got
plans,
baby
girl
Welcome
to
Mom
and
Dad’s
crazy
world
Love,
Daddy,
maple-flavored
kisses,
buttered
pancakes,
and
syrup
I
built
this
castle
Now
we
are
trapped
on
the
throne
I'm
sorry
we're
alone
I
wrote
my
chapter
You'll

I'm

To

whatever,
to
do
whatever
December
1st,
1996,
dear
Hailie
You
got
your
momma's
personality,
same
eyes
as
I
got
Her
beautiful
smile,
but
your
ears
are
the
same
size
as
mine
are
Sorry
for
that,
a
little
minor
mishap
But
you'll
grow
into
them,
baby,
I'm
on
the
grind
now
I'm
doing
little
shows,
open
mics,
all-nighters
at
studios
While
I'm
tryna
keep
the
lights
on
Why
does
it
seem
like
I'm
so
close
to
this
dream,
yet
so
far?
I
just
keep
steering,
I'ma
turn
into
someone
I
haven't
the
slightest
clue
what
I'ma
do
if
it
falls
through
You
took
your
first
steps
today,
you'll
probably
walk
soon
My
Infinite
CD
flopped,
too
many
soft
tunes
They're
talking
bad
about
Dad,
it's
ticking
me
off
too
Makes
me
feel
like
I
don't
belong
or
something,
ooh
I
think
I
might
have
just
stumbled
onto
something
new
Got
a
prediction
for
the
future,
I'm
hoping
that
you
Open
this
envelope
when
you're
older
and
it
holds
true
I
built
this
castle
Now
we
are
trapped
on
the
throne
I'm
sorry
we're
alone
I

December
24th,
2007,
dear
Hailie
Now
if
you
found
these
letters,
I
guess
I
better
try
to
explain
A
lot's
happened
in
between
them
since
I
rised
to
this
fame
I've
said
your
name
but
always
tried
to
hide
your
face
This
game
is
crazy,
I
wanted
to
claim
my
love
for
you,
but
dang
I
never
knew
it'd
be
like
this,
if
I
did
I
wouldn't
have
done
it
You
ain't
asked
for
none
of
this
shit,
now
you're
being
punished?!
Things
that
should've
been
private
with
me
and
your
mother
is
public
I
can't
stomach,
they
can
take
this
fame
back,
I
don't
want
it
I'll
put
out
this
last
album
then
I'm
done
with
it
One-hundred
percent
finished
Fed
up
with
it,
I'm
hanging
it
up,
fuck
it
Excuse
the
cursing,
baby,
but
just
know
That
I'm
a
good
person,
though
they
portray
me
as
cold
And
if
things
should
worsen,
don't
take
this
letter
I
wrote
As
a
goodbye
note,
but
your
dad's
at
the
end
of
his
rope
I'm
sliding
down
a
slippery
slope
Anyways
sweetie,
I
better
go
I'm
getting
sleepy,
love,
Dad…
shit,
I
don't
know
If
I
could
rewind
time
like
a
tape
Inside
a
boombox,
one
day
for
every
pill
or
Percocet
that
I
ate
Cut
down
on
the
Valium,
I'da
heard
everything
But
death
is
turning
so
definite—wait!
They
got
me
all
hooked
up
to
some
machine
I
love
you,
Bean,
didn't
want
you
to
know
I
was
struggling
Feels
like
I'm
underwater
submerged
like
a
submarine
Just
heard
that
nurse
say,
my
liver
and
kidneys
aren't
functioning
Been
flirtatious
with
death,
skirt-chasing,
I
guess
It's
arrivederci,
same
nurse,
just
heard
say
they're
unplugging
me
And
it's
your
birthday,
Jade,
I'm
missing
your
birthday
Baby
girl,
I'm
sorry,
I
fucking
hate
when
you
hurt,
Hai
And
sweeties,
thank
you
for
waiting
to
open
gifts
But,
girls,
you
can
just
open
'em
Dad
ain't
making
it
home
for
Christmas
Wish
I
had
the
strength
to
just
blow
a
kiss
I
go
to
make
a
fist,
but
I
can't
make
one,
I'm
frozen
stiff
I
yell,
but
nothing
comes
out,
I'm
crying
inside,
I
shout
My
vocal
cords
won't
permit
me,
I
scream,
but
it's
not
aloud
You
put
your
arm
around
Momma
to
calm
her,
wow
I
just
thought
about
the
aisle
I'll
never
get
to
walk
us
down
Never
see
you
graduate
in
your
caps
and
gowns
It's
'bout
to
be
2008,
how's
this
happening
now?
I've
got
so
much
more
to
do
And,
Proof,
I'm
truly
sorry
if
I
let
you
down,
but
this
tore
me
in
two
The
thought
of
no
more
me
and
you
You
gave
me
shoes,
Nikes
like
new
for
me
for
school
Doody,
I'm
trying,
but
you,
you
were
the
glue
that
binded
So
many
things—time,
I'd
give
anything
to
rewind
it
I
had
to
walk
down
my
halls
and
constantly
be
reminded
By
pictures
all
on
my
walls
and
I
couldn't
sleep
at
night
'cause
That
image
burned
in
my
brain
of
you
on
that
table
Me
falling
across
your
body,
not
able
to
stand
to
save
you
God,
why
did
you
take
him?
I'm
tryna
keep
his
legacy
alive,
but
I'm
dying,
where's
Nathan?
Little
ladies,
be
brave,
take
care
of
your
mother
Smile
pretty
for
pictures,
always
cherish
each
other
I'll
always
love
ya,
and
I'll
be
in
the
back
of
your
memory
And
I
know
you'll
never
forget
me
Just
don't
get
sad
when
remembering
And,
little
bro,
keep
making
me
proud
You
better
marry
that
girl
'cause
she's
faithfully
down
And
when
you're
exchanging
those
sacred
vows
Just
know
that
if
I
could
be
there,
I
would
And
should
you
ever
see
parenthood,
I
know
you'll
be
good
at
it
Oh,
almost
forgot
to
do
something,
thank
my
father
too
I
actually
learned
a
lot
from
you
You
taught
me
what
not
to
do
And,
Mom,
wish
I'd
have
had
the
chance
To
have
one
last
heart-to-heart
honest
and
open
talk
with
you
Doody,
I
see
you,
I
go
to
walk
to
you
And
I
can
feel
my
soul
leave
my
body
and
float
across
the
room
Nurses
lean
over
the
bed,
pulling
tubes
out
Then
the
sheet
over
my
head,
shut
the
room
down
Girls,
please
don't
get
upset
I
see
them
cheeks
soaking
and
wet
As
you
squeeze
hold
of
my
neck,
so
forcibly,
don't
wanna
let
Me
go,
pillow
drenched,
emotional
wrecks
With
every
second,
each
closer
to
death
But
suddenly
I
feel
my
heart
begin
to
beat
slow
Then
a
breath,
machines
go
(*beep
beep
beep*)
Must've
guessed
the
cheat
codes
to
this
shit
I'm
tryna
rewind
time
like
a
tape
Find
an
escape,
make
a
beeline,
try
and
awake
From
this
dream,
I
need
to
re-find
my
inner
strength
To
remind
me,
even
if
a
steep
climb
I
must
take
To
rewrite
a
mistake,
I'm
rewinding
the
tape
(I
don't
want
it!)
I'll
put
out
this
last
album,
then
I'm
done
with
it
One
hundred
percent
finished,
fed
up
with
it
I'm
hanging
it
up,
fuck
it!
Excuse
the
cursing,
baby,
but
just
know
That
I'm
a
good
person,
though
they
portray
me
as
cold
And
if
things
should
worsen,
but
I
bet
you
they
won't
I'm
pledging
to
throw
this
methadone
in
the
toilet
Shred
these
old
letters
I
wrote
All
that
old
pathetic
loathing,
closing
credits
can
roll
I'm
proud
to
be
back
I'm
'bout
to,
like
a
rematch,
outdo
Relapse
With

Help

laps
Gas
toward
'em
and
fast
forward
the

Consider
them

four
minutes
as
The
song
I'da
sang
to
my
daughters
If
I'da
made
it
to
the
hospital
less
than
2
hours
later,
but
I
fought
it
And
came
back
like
a
boomerang
on
'em
Now
a
new
day
is
dawnin'
I'm

it's

Part

Produced
by
S1
and
M-Phazes
It's
like
I'm
in
this
dirt,
digging
up
old
hurt
Tried
everything
to
get
my
mind
off
you,
it
won't
work
All
it
takes
is
one
song
on
the
radio,
you're
Right
back
on
it,
reminding
me
all
over
again
How
you
fucking
just
brushed
me
off
and
left
me
so
burnt
Spent
a
lot
of
time
tryin'
to
soul
search
Maybe
I
needed
to
grow
up
a
little
first
Well,
looks
like
I
hit
a
growth
spurt
But
I'm
coming
for
closure
Don't
suppose
an
explanation
I'm
owed,
for
The
way
that
you
turned
your
back
on
me
Just
when
I
may
have
needed
you
most
Oh,
you
thought
it
was
over?
You
could
just
close
the
Chapter
and
go
about
your
life
like
it
was
nothing?
You
ruined
mine,
but
you
seem
to
be
doin'
fine
Well,
I've
never
recovered
But
tonight
I
bet
you
that
what
you're
'Bout
to
go
through's
tougher
than
anything
I
ever
have
suffered
Can't
think
of
a
better
way
to
define
poetic
justice
Can
I
hold
grudges?
Mind
saying,
"Let
it
go,
fuck
this."
Heart's
saying,
"I
will,
once
I
bury
this
bitch
alive
Hide
the
shovel
and
then
drive
off
in
the
sunset."
I
flee
the
scene
like
it
was
my
last
ride
You
see
right
through
Oh,
you
had
me
pegged
the
first
time
You
can
see
the
truth,
but
it's
easier
to
justify
What's
bad
is
good
and
I
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy
I
just
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy
(Follow
me,
I
ruh-uh-un;
follow
me,
I
ruh-uh-un)
I
just
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy
(Follow
me,
I
ruh-uh-un;
follow
me,
I
ruh-uh-un)
And
to
think
I
used
to
think
you
was
the
shit,
bitch
To
think
it
was
you
at
one
time
I
worshipped,
shit
Think
you
can
hurt
people
and
just
keep
getting
away
with
it?
Not
this
time,
you
better
go
and
get
the
sewing
kit,
bitch!
Finish
this
stitch,
so
you
can
reap
what
you
sew,
nitwit
Thought
some
time
would
pass
and
I'd
forget
it?
Forget
it!
You
left
our
family
in
shambles
And
you
expect
me
to
just
get
over
him,
pretend
he
never
existed?
May
be
gone
but
he's
not
forgotten
And
don't
think
‘cause
he's
been
out
the
pictures
So
long
that
I've
stopped
the
plottin'
and
still
ain't
comin'
to
get
ya
You're
wrong
and
that
shit
was
rotten
And
the
way
you
played
him,
same
shit
you
did
to
me,
cold
Have
you
any
idea
the
shit
that
I've
gone
through?
Feelings
I
harbor?
All
this
pent-up
resentment
I
hold
on
to?
Not
once
you
call
to
ask
me
how
I'm
doin'
Letters,
you
don't
respond
to
'em
Fuck
it,
I'm
coming
to
see
you
And,
gee,
who
better
to
talk
to
than
you?
The
cause
of
my
problems
My
life
is
garbage,
and
I'm
'bout
to
take
it
out
on
you
Poof,
then
I'm
gone,
voosh
I
flee
the
scene
like
it
was
my
last
ride
You
see
right
through
Oh,
you
had
me
pegged
the
first
time
You
can
see
the
truth,
but
it's
easier
to
justify
What's
bad
is
good
and
I
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy
I
just
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy
(Follow
me,
I
ruh-uh-un;
follow
me,
I
ruh-uh-un)
I
just
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy
(Follow
me,
I
ruh-uh-un;
follow
me,
I
ruh-uh-un)
I've
been
drivin'
around
your
side
of
this
town
Like
9
frickin'
hours
and
45
minutes
now
Finally
I
found
your
new
address,
park
in
your
drive
Feel
like
I've
been
waiting
on
this
moment
all
of
my
life
And
it's
now
arrived,
and
my
mouth
is
full
of
saliva
My
knife
is
out
and
I'm
ducking
on
the
side
of
your
house
See,
it's
sad
it
came
to
this
point
Such
a
disappointment
I
had
to
make
this
appointment
To
come
and
see
ya,
but
I
ain't
here
for
your
empathy
I
don't
need
your
apology
or
your
friendship
or
sympathy
It's
revenge
that
I
seek
So
I
sneak
vengefully,
and
treat
your
bedroom
window
Like
I
reached
my
full
potential:
I
peeked
Continue
to
peep,
still
bent
low,
then
keep
Tapping
the
glass
lightly
then
start
to
crescendo,
sneak
All
the
way
'round
to
the
back
porch
Man,
door
handles
unlocked,
shouldn't
be
that
easy
to
do
this
You
don't
plan
for
intruders
beforehand?
Surprised
to
see
me?
Cat
caught
your
tongue?
Gag,
chloroform
rag,
dag,
almost
hack-up
a
lung
Like
you
picked
an
axe
up
and
swung,
stick
to
the
core
plan
Dragged
to
the
back
of
a
trunk
by
one
of
your
fans
Irony's
spectacular,
huh?
Now
who's
a
faggot,
you
punk?
And
here's
your
Bronco
hat
You
can
have
that
shit
back
‘cause
they
suck
It's
just
me,
you
and
the
music
now,
Slim,
I
hope
you
hear
it
We're
in
the
car
right
now
–
wait,
here
comes
my
favorite
lyric
"I'm
the
bad
guy
who
makes
fun
of
people
that
die"
And
hey,
here's
a
sequel
to
my
Mathers
LP
just
to
try
to
get
people
to
buy
How's
this
for
a
publicity
stunt?
This
should
be
fun!
Last
album
now,
‘cause
after
this
you'll
be
officially
done
Eminem
killed
by
M
and
M,
Matthew
Mitchell
Bitch,
I
even
have
your
initials
I
initially
was
gonna
bury
you
next
to
my
brother,
but
fuck
it
Since
you're
in
love
with
your
city
so
much,
I
figured,
what
the
fuck
The
best
place
you
could
be
buried
alive
is
right
here
Two
more
exits,
time
is
quite
near
Hope
we
don't
get
stopped,
no
license
I
fear
That
sirens
I
hear?
Guess
90
on
the
freeway
wasn't
the
brightest
idea,
as
cops
appear
in
my
driver's
side
mirror
(Oh,
God!
Police!
Aaaghh!)
Hope
Foxtrot
gets
an
aerial
shot
of
your
burial
plot,
at
least
New
plan,
Stan!
Slim:
"Chauvinist
pig
drove
in
this
big
Lincoln
Town
Car"
Well,
gotta
go,
almost
at
the
bridge
Ha
ha,
big
bro,
it's
for
you;
Slim,
this
is
for
him
And
Frank
Ocean;
oh,
hope
you
can
swim
good
Now
say
you
hate
homos
again!

Anyone
on
the
receiving
end
of
those
jokes
you
offend
I'm
the
nightmare
you
fell
asleep
and
then
woke
up
still
in
I'm
your
karma
closing
in
with
each
stroke
of
a
pen
Perfect
time
to
have
some
remorse
to
show
for
your
sin
Nope,
it's
hopeless,
I'm
the
denial
that
you're
hopelessly
in
When
they
say
all
of
this
is
approachin'
its
end
But
you
refuse
to
believe
that
it's
over,
here
we
go
all
over
again
Back's
to
the
wall,
I'm
stacking
up
all
them
odds
Toilets
clogged,
yeah,
‘cause
I'm
talking
a
lot
of
Shit
but
I'm
backing
it
all
up
But
in
my
head
there's
a
voice
in
the
back
and
it
hollers
After
the
track
is
demolished,
I
am
your
lack
of
a
conscience
I'm
the
ringing
in
your
ears
I'm
the
polyps
on
the
back
of
your
tonsils
Eatin'
your
vocal
chords
after
your
concerts
I'm
your
time
that's
almost
up
that
you
haven't
acknowledged
Grab
for
some
water
But
I'm
that
pill
that's
too
jagged
to
swallow
I'm
the
bullies
you
hate
that
you
became
With
every
faggot
you
slaughtered
Coming
back
on
you,
every
woman
you
insult
Batter,
but
the
double-standards
you
have
When
it
comes
to
your
daughters
I
represent
everything
you
take
for
granted
‘Cause
Marshall
Mathers,
the
rapper's
persona
Is
half
a
facade,
and
Matthew
and
Stan's
just
symbolic
Of
you
not
knowing
what
you
had
'til
it's
gone
‘Cause
after
all
the
glitz
and
the
glam
No
more
fans
that
are
calling
your
name
Cameras
are
off,
sad,
but
it
happens
to
all
of
them
I'm
the

to
say,
“I
told
you
so!”
Foreshadows
of
all
the
things

are

I'm

baggage
you
have,
but
as
you
gather
up
all
your
possessions
If
there's
anything
you
have
left
to
say
'Less
it
makes
an
impact,
then
don't
bother
So
'fore
you
rest
your
case
Better
make
sure
you're
packin'
a
wallop
So,
one
last
time,
I'm
back
Before
it
fades
into
black
and
it's
all
over
Behold
the
final
chapter
in
a
saga
Tryin'
to
recapture
that
lightning
trapped
in
a
bottle
Twice,
the
magic
that
started
It
all,
tragic
portrait
of
an
artist
Tortured,
trapped
in
his
own
drawings
Tap
into
thoughts
blacker
and
darker
Than
anything
imaginable;
here
goes
a
wild
stab
in
the
dark
As
we
pick
up
where
the
last
Mathers
left
off
Don't
kill
me!
Hurry
the
fuck
up!
(Shoots
the
teller)
Thank
you!
(Running)
Go,
go,
go!
What
the...
fuck?
The
fuck
did
he
go?
Mothafucka
bail
on
me?
Fuck
you!
*Car
stops
working*
Aw,
you
gotta
be
fucking
kidding
me!
Are
you
fucking
kidding
me?
Shit!
(Running)
(Climbs
a
fence)
Get
off!
(Shoots
a
dog)
Ha-ha!
(Sirens)
Parking
lot!
Shit,
ah!
Let
me
see
your
hands,
bend
over!
Ah,
fuck
it!
(Shoots
himself)
Yeah,
yeah
Yeah,
yeah
yeah
("What's
your
name?")
Marshall
("Who's
your
daddy?")
I
don't
have
one
My
mother
reproduced
like
the
komodo
dragon
And
had
me
on
the
back
of
a
motorcycle,
then
crashed
in
The
side
of
loco-motive
with
rap,
I'm
Loco,
it's
like
handing
a
psycho
a
loaded
handgun
Michelangelo
with
a
paint
gun
in
a
tantrum
'Bout
to
explode
all
over
the
canvas
Back
with
the
Yoda
of
rap,
"In
a
spasm
Your
music
usually
has
'em
But
waned
for
the
game
your
enthusiasm
it
hasn't
Follow
you
must,
Rick
Rubin
my
little
Padawan."
A
Jedi
in
training,
colossal
brain
and
Thoughts
are
entertainin'
But
docile
and
impossible
to
explain
and,
I'm
also
vain
and
Probably
find
a
way
to
complain
about
a
Picasso
painting
Puke
Skywalker,
but
sound
like
Chewbacca
when
I
talk
Full
of
such
blind
rage
I
need
a
seein'
eye
dog
Can't
even
find
the
page
I
was
writing
this
rhyme
on
Oh,
it's
on
the
ram-page
Couldn't
see
what
I
wrote,
I
write
small
It
says,
"Ever
since
I
drove
a
'79
Lincoln
with
whitewalls
Had
a
fire
in
my
heart
And
a
dire
desire
to
aspire
to
Die
Hard."
So
as
long
as
I'm
on
the
clock,
punching
this
time
card
Hip-hop
ain't
dying
on
my
watch
Now
sometimes
when
I'm
sleepin'
She
comes
to
me
in
my
dreams
Is
she
taken?
Is
she
mine?
Don't
got
time,
don't
care,
don't
have
two
shits
to
give
Let
me
take
you
by
the
hand
to
promised
land
And
threaten
everyone
'Cause
there's
no
rhyme
or
no
reason
for
nothing
("Now,
what's
your
name?")
Marshall
("Who's
your
daddy?")
I
don’t
know
him,
but
I
wonder—
("Is
he
rich
like
me?")
Ha
("Has
he
taken
any
time
to
show
you
what
you
need
to
live?")
No,
if
he
had
He
wouldn't
have
ended
up
in
these
rhymes
on
my
pad
I
wouldn't
be
so
mad,
my
attitude
wouldn't
be
so
bad
Yeah,
Dad,
I'm
the
epitome
and
the
prime
Example
of
what
happens
when
the
power
of
the
rhyme
Falls
into
the
wrong
hands
and
Makes
you
want
to
get
up
and
start
dancin'
Even
if
it
is
Charles
Manson
Who
just
happens
to
be
rappin',
blue
lights
flashin'
Laughin'
all
the
way
to
the
bank,
lampin'
in
my
K-Mart
mansion
I’m
in
the
style
department
With
a
pile
in
my
cart,
rippin'
the
aisle
apart
but
With
great
power
comes
Absolutely
no
responsibility
for
content
Completely
despondent
and
condescending
The
king
of
nonsense
and
controversy
is
on
a
Beat-killing
spree,
Your
Honor
I
must
plead
guilty,
'cause
I
sparked
a
revolution
Rebel
without
a
cause
who
caused
the
evolution
Of
rap,
to
take
it
to
the
next
level,
boost
it
But
several
rebuked
it,
and
whoever
produced
it
("Hip-hop
is
the
Devil's
music")
Does
that
mean
it
belongs
to
me?
'Cause
I
just
happen
to
be
a
white
honky
devil
with
two
horns
That
don't
honk
but
every
time
I
speak
you
hear
a
beep
But
lyrically
I
never
hear
a
peep,
not
even
a
whisper
Rappers
better
stay
clear
of
me,
bitch,
'cause
it's
the—
It's
the
time
of
the
season
When
hate
runs
high
And
this
time,
I
won't
give
it
to
you
easy
When
I
take
back
what's
mine
With
pleasured
hands
And
torture
everyone,
that
is
my
plan
My
job
here
isn't
done
'Cause
there's
no
rhyme
or
no
reason
for
nothing
("What's
your
name?")
Shady
("Who's
your
daddy?")
I
don’t
give
a
fuck,
but
I
wonder
("Is
he
rich
like
me?")
Doubt
it,
ha
("Has
he
taken
any
time
to
show
you
what
you
need
to
live?")
So,
yeah,
Dad—let's
walk
Let's
have
us
a
father-and-son
talk
But
I
bet
we
wouldn't
probably
get
one
block
Without
me
knocking
your
block
off,
this
is
all
your
fault
Maybe
that's
why
I'm
so
bananas
I
a-ppealed
to
all
those
walks
Of
life,
whoever
had
strife
Maybe
that's
what
dad
and
son
talks
are
like
'Cause
I
related
to
the
struggles
of
young
America
When
their
fucking
parents
were
unaware
of
their
troubles
Now
they're
rippin'
out
their
fuckin'
hair
again,
it's
hysterical
I
chuckle
as
everybody
bloodies
their
bare
knuckles
Yeah,
uh-oh,
better
beware,
knuckle
heads!
The
sign
of
my
hustle
says:
"Don't
knock,
the
door's
broken,
it
won't
lock
It
might
just
fly
open,
get
cold-cocked
You
critics
come
to
pay
me
a
visit?
Misery
loves
company,
please
stay
a
minute!"
Kryptonite
to
a
hypocrite
Zip
your
lip
if
you
dish
it
but
can't
take
it
Too
busy
gettin'
stoned
in
your
glass
house
To
kick
rocks,
then
you
wonder
why
I
lash
out
Mr.
Mathers
as
advertised
on
the
flyers,
so
spread
the
word
'Cause
I'm
promoting
my
passion
until
I'm
passed
out
Completely
brain-dead:
Rain
Man
Doing
a
Bankhead
in
a
restraint
chair
So,
bitch,
shoot
me
a
look,
it
better
be
a
blank
stare
Or
get
shanked
in
the
pancreas
I'm
angrier
than
all
eight
other
reindeer
Put
together
with
Chief
Keef
'cause
I
hate
every
fuckin'
thang,
yeah
Even
this
rhyme,
bitch
And
quit
tryin'
look
for
a
fuckin'
reason
for
it
that
ain't
there
But
I
still
am
a
"Criminal!"
Ten-year-old
degenerate
grabbin'
on
my
genitals!
The
last
Mathers
LP
done
went
diamond
This
time
I'm
predicting
this
one
will
go
emerald!
When
will
the
madness
end?
How
can
it
when
there's
no
method
to
the
pad
and
pen?
The
only
message
that
I
have
to
send
Is:
"Dad,
I'm
back
at
it
again!"
Yeah…
(Who's
your
daddy?)
You
fuckin'
groupie
Pick
up
the
goddamn
phone
Bitch,
where
the
fuck
were
you
Tuesday?
With
who
you
say?
I
wasn't
at
the
studio,
bitch,
what'd
you
do?
Screw
Dre?
You
went
there
lookin'
for
me?
Boo,
that
excuse
is
too
lame
Keep
playin'
me,
you're
gonna
end
up
with
a
huge
goose
egg
You
fake,
lyin'
slut,
you
never
told
me
you
knew
Drake
And
Lupe?
You
wanna
loose
two
legs?
You
tryin'
to
flip
this
on
me?
If
I
spent
more
time
with
you,
you
say
"Okay,
yeah,
and
I'm
coo-coo,
eh?"
—
Well,
screw
you
And
I'll
be
the
third
person
who
screwed
you
today
Oh,
fourth—Dre,
Drake,
Lupe—oohm,
touché
You
were
too
two-faced
for
me
Thought
you
was
my
number
one
true-blue
ace
But
you
ain't
and
I
can't
see
you
when
you
make
that
wittle
boo-boo
face
'Cause
I'm
hanging
up
this
phone,
boo,
you
make
my
fuckin'
Bluetooth
ache
You're
feeling
blue?
Too
late,
go
smurf
yourself
You
make
me
wanna
smurf
and
puke
blue
Kool
Aid
Here's
what
you
say
to
someone
you
hate
My
life
would
be
so
much
better
If
you
just
dropped
dead
I
was
layin'
in
bed
last
night,
thinkin'
And
then
this
thought
just
popped
in
my
head
And
I
thought,
wouldn't
shit
just
be
a
lot
easier
If
you
dropped
dead?
I
would
feel
so
much,
much
better
Think
I
just
relapsed,
this
bitch
pushed
me
over
the
brink
Hop
on
the
freeway
tryna
get
some
time
alone
and
just
think
'Til
the
cops
pulled
me
over,
but
they
let
me
go,
'cause
I
told
'em
I'm
only
drivin'
drunk
'cause
that
bitch
drove
me
to
drink
I'm
back
on
my
fuck
hoes,
with
a
whole
new
hatred
for
blondes
But
bias?
I
hate
all
bitches
the
same,
baby,
come
on!
Excuse
the
pun,
but
bitch
is
such
a
broad
statement,
and
I'm
Channelin'
my
anger
through
every
single
station
that's
on!
'Cause
a
woman
broke
my
he-art,
I
say,
"he-art"
'Cause
she
ripped
it
in
two
pa-arts
and
threw
it
in
the
garbage
Who
do
you
think
you
a-are?
Bitch,
guess
it's
time
for
me
to
get
the
dust
off
And
pick
myself
up
off
the
carpet
But
I'll
never
say
the
L-word
again
I
lo-lo-lo-lo…
lesbian!
Aaahhh!
I
hope
you
hear
this
song
And
go
into
a
cardiac
arrest,
my
life'd
be
so
much
better
if
you
just—
My
life
would
be
so
much
better
If
you
just
dropped
dead
I
was
layin'
in
bed
last
night,
thinkin'
And
then
this
thought
just
popped
in
my
head
And
I
thought,
wouldn't
shit
just
be
a
lot
easier
If
you
dropped
dead?
I
would
feel
so
much,
much
better
'Cause
you
told
me
You'd
love
me
Forever
Bitch,
that
was
a
lie
Now
I
never
Wanted
someone
to
die
So
bad
in
my
fuckin'
life
But
fuck
it,
there’s
other
fish
in
the
sea
And
I'ma
have
a
whale
of
a
time
Bein'
a
single
sailor
for
the
night,
bitch,
on
a
scale
of
One
to
ten,
shit,
I
must
be
the
Holy
Grail
of
Catches,
ho,
I
got
an
Oscar
attached
to
my
fuckin'
name
(De
La)
I
might
hit
the
club,
find
a
chick
that's
tailor-made
For
me,
say
fuck
it,
kick
some
shots
back,
get
hammered,
and
nail
her
These
bitches
tryin'
to
get
attached,
but
they're
failin'
to
latch
onto
the
tail
of
My
bumper,
they're
scratchin'
at
the
back
of
my
trailer
Like
I'm
itchin'
to
get
hitched,
yeah,
I'm
rich
as
a
bitch
But
bitches
ain't
shit,
I'd
rather
leave
a
bitch
in
a
ditch
Bitch,
you
complain
when
you
listen
to
this
But
you
still
throw
yourself
at
me:
that's
what
I
call
pitchin'
a
bitch
That's
why
I'm
swingin'
at
this
chicks
on-site
Long
as
I
got
a
bat
and
two
balls
it's
foul,
but
my
dick's
on
strike
So
all
that
love
shit
is
null
and
void,
bitch,
I'm
a
droid
I
avoid
Cupid,
stupid!
Wasn't
for
blow
jobs,
you'd
be
unemployed
Oye-yoy-yoy,
man-oh-man,
your
boy-boy-boy's
Gettin'
sick
of
these
girls-girls-girls,
oink-oink-oink
You
fuckin'
pigs,
all
you're
good
for
is
doink-doink-doink
I
got
99
problems
and
a
bitch
ain't
one
She's
all
99
of
'em,
I
need
a
machine
gun
I'll
take
'em
all
out,
I
hope
you
hear
this
song
And
go
into
a
cardiac
arrest,
have
a
heart
attack
and
just
Drop
dead,
and
I'ma
throw
a
fuckin'
party
after
this,
'cause
yes
My
life
would
be
so
much
better
If
you
just
dropped
dead
(I
hate
you)
I
was
layin'
in
bed
last
night,
thinkin'
And
then
this
thought
just
popped
in
my
head
(You
made
me
like
this
way)
And
I
thought,
wouldn't
shit
just
be
a
lot
easier
If
you
dropped
dead?
(Bitch)
I
would
feel
so
much,
much
better
I'm
just
playin',
bitch
You
know
I
love
you
This
is
survival
of
the
fittest
This
is
do
or
die
This
is
the
winner
takes
it
all
So,
take
it
all,
a-all,
a-all,
a-all
Wasn't
ready
to
be
no
millionaire,
I
was
ill-prepared
I
was
prepared
to
be
ill
though,
the
skill
was
there
From
the
beginning
it
wasn't
'bout
the
ends,
it
was
'bout
Bustin'
raps
and
standin'
for
somethin',
fuck
an
acronym
Cut
the
fuckin'
act
like
you're
happy,
I'm
fuckin'
back
again
With
another
anthem
–
why
stop
when
it
doesn't
have
to
end?
It
ain't
over
'til
I
say
it's
over,
enough
when
I
say
enough
Throw
me
to
them
wolves
and
close
the
gate
up,
I'm
afraid
of
What'll
happen
to
them
wolves
when
the
thought
of
being
thrown
Into
an
alligator
pit,
I
salivate
at
it,
wait
is
up
Hands
up
like
it's
12
noon,
nah,
homie,
hold
them
bitches
straighter
up
Wave
'em
'til
you
dislocate
a
rotator
cuff
Came
up
rough,
came
to
ruffle
feathers,
nah,
egos,
I
ain't
deflate
enough
Last
chance
to
make
this
whole
stadium
erupt,
'cause—
This
is
survival
of
the
fittest
This
is
do
or
die
This
is
the
winner
takes
it
all
So,
take
it
all,
a-all,
a-all,
a-all
I
can
see
the
finish
line
with
each
line
that
I
finish
I'm
so
close
to
my
goals,
I
can
almost
pole
vault
over
the
goal
post
And
if
I
don't
got
enough
in
the
tank,
maybe
I
can
just
siphon
enough
To
fill
up
this
last
can,
man,
will
I
survive
in
this
climate
or
what?
They
said
I
was
washed-up
and
got
a
bloodbath
I'm
not
a
rapper,
I'm
an
adapter:
I
can
adjust
Plus,
I
can
just
walk
up
to
a
mic
and
just
bust
So,
floor's
open
if
you'd
like
to
discuss
Top
5
in
this
muh'fucka,
and
if
I
don't
make
the
cut
What?
Like
I
give
a
fuck!
I'ma
light
this
bitch
up
like
I'm
driving
a
truck
Through
the
side
of
a
pump,
0
to
60,
hop
in
and
gun
it
Like
G-Unit
without
the
hyphen,
I'm
hyping
'em
up
And
if
there
should
ever
come
a
time
where
my
life's
in
a
rut
And
I
look
like
I
might
just
give
up,
eh,
might've
mistook
Me
for
bowin'
out,
I
ain't
takin'
a
bow,
I'm
stabbin'
myself
With
a
fuckin'
knife
in
the
gut
while
I'm
wipin'
my
butt
'Cause
I
just
shitted
on
the
mic
and
I
like
gettin'
cut
I
get
excited
at
the
sight
of
my
blood,
you're
in
a
fight
with
a
nut
'Cause
I'ma
fight
'til
I
die
or
win,
bitin'
the
dust
It'll
just
make
me
angrier;
wait,
let
me
remind
you
of
what
Got
me
this
far,
picture
me
quittin'
Now
draw
a
circle
around
it
and
put
a
line
through
it,
slut!
It's
survival
of
what?
This
is
survival
of
the
fittest
This
is
do
or
die
This
is
the
winner
takes
it
all
So,
take
it
all,
a-all,
a-all,
a-all
So,
take
it
all,
a-all,
a-all,
a-all
(Yeah)
So,
get
your
ideas,
stack
your
ammo
But
don't
come
unless
you
come
to
battle,
now
mount
up,
jump
in
the
saddle
This
is
it—it's
what
you
eat,
sleep,
piss
and
shit
Live,
breathe,
your
whole
existence
just
consists
of
this
Refuse
to
quit,
fuse
is
lit,
can't
defuse
the
wick
If
I
don't
do
this
music
shit,
I'll
lose
my
shit
Ain't
got
shit
to
lose,
it's
the
moment
of
truth,
it's
all
I
know
how
to
do
As
soon
as
I
get
thrown
in
a
booth,
I
spit
But
my
respect
is
overdue,
I'm
showin'
you
the
flow
no
one
do
'Cause
I
don't
own
no
diploma
for
school,
I
quit
So
there's
nothin'
for
me
to
fall
back
on,
I
know
no
other
trade
So
you
better
trade
your
fuckin'
mics
in
for
some
tool-box-es
'Cause
you'll
never
take
my
pride
from
me,
it'll
have
to
be
pried
from
me
So,
pull
out
your
pliers
and
your
screwdrivers!
But
I
want
you
to
doubt
me,
I
don't
want
you
to
buh-lieve
'Cause
this
is
somethin'
that
I
must
use
to
succeed
And
if
you
don't
like
me,
then
fuck
you!
Self-esteem
Must
be
fuckin'
shootin'
through
the
roof,
'cause
trust
me
My
skin
is
too
thick
and
bulletproof
to
touch
me
I
can
see
why
the
fuck
I
disgust
you,
I
must
be
Allergic
to
failure,
'cause
everytime
I
come
close
to
it
I
just
sneeze,
but
I
just
go
achoo
then
a-chieve!
This
is
survival
of
the
fittest
This
is
do
or
die
This
is
the
winner
takes
it
all
So,
take
it
all,
a-all,
a-all,
a-all
So,
take
it
all,
a-all,
a-all,
a-all
Tell
me
where
to
go
Tell
me
what
to
do
I'll
be
right
there
for
you
Tell
me
what
to
say
No
matter
if
it's
true
I'll
say
it
all
for
you
I
used
to
be
the
type
of
kid
That
would
always
think
the
sky
is
fallin'
Why
am
I
so
differently
wired?
Am
I
a
martian?
What
kind
of
twisted
experiment
am
I
involved
in?
‘Cause
I
don't
belong
in
this
world
That's
why
I'm
scoffin'
at
authority,
defiant
often
Flyin'
off
at
the
handle
at
my
mom
No
dad,
so
I
am
noncompliant
at
home
At
school
I'm
just
shy
and
awkward
And
I
don't
need
no
goddamn
psychologist
Tryna
diagnose
why
I
have
all
these
underlyin'
problems
Thinkin'
he
can
try
and
solve
'em
I'm
outside
chalkin'
up
drawings
On
the
sidewalk
and
in
the
front
drive
talkin'
To
myself,
either
that
or
inside
hidin'
off
in
The
corner
somewhere
quiet,
tryin'
not
to
Be
noticed
‘cause
I'm
cryin'
and
sobbin'
I
had
a
bad
day
at
school
so
I
ain't
talkin'
Some
cocksucker
shoved
me
into
a
fuckin'
locker
‘Cause
he
said
that
I
eye-balled
him
And
if
you
fall,
I'll
get
you
there
I'll
be
your
savior
from
all
the
wars
That
are
fought
inside
your
world
Please
have
faith
in
my
words
‘Cause
this
is
my
legacy,
legacy,
yeah
This
is
my
legacy,
legacy,
yeah
There's
no
guarantee
It's
not
up
to
me,
we
can
only
see
This
is
my
legacy,
legacy,
legacy,
legacy
I
used
to
be
the
type
of
kid
that
would
always
think
the
sky's
fallin'
Why
am
I
so
differently
wired
in
my
noggin?
‘Cause
sporadic
as
my
thoughts
come,
it's
mind-bogglin'
‘Cause
I
obsess
on
everything
in
my
mind,
small
shit
Bothers
me,
but
not
my
father,
he
said
sayonara
Then
split,
but
I
don’t
give
a
shit
I'm
fine
long
as
there's
batteries
in
my
Walkman
Nothing
is
the
matter
with
me
Shit,
look
on
the
bright
side,
at
least
I
ain't
walkin'
I
bike
ride
through
the
neighborhood
of
my
apartment
Complex
on
a
ten-speed
which
I've
acquired
parts
that
I
find
in
the
garbage,
a
frame
then
put
tires
on
it
Headphones
on,
look
straight
ahead
if
kids
try
and
start
shit
But
if
this
is
all
there
is
for
me
life
offers
Why
bother
even
tryin'
to
put
up
a
fight?
It's
nonsense
But
I
think
a
light
bulb
just
lit
up
in
my
conscience
What
about
them
rhymes
I've
been
jottin'?
They
are
kind
of
giving
me
confidence
Instead
of
tryin'
to
escape
through
my
comics
Why
don't
I
just
blast
a
little
something
like
Onyx?
To
put
me
in
the
mood
to
wanna
fight
and
write
songs
that
Say
what
I
wanna
say
to
the
kid
that
said
that
I
eye-balled
him
Grab
hold
of
my
balls,
like,
"That's
right,
fight's
on,
bitch!"
Who
woulda
knew,
from
the
moment
I
turned
the
mic
on,
that
I
could
be
iconic
in
my
conquest?
That's
word
to
Phife
Dawg
from
A
Tribe
Called
Quest
This
is
my
legacy,
legacy,
yeah
This
is
my
legacy,
legacy,
yeah
There's
no
guarantee
It's
not
up
to
me,
we
can
only
see
This
is
my
legacy,
legacy,
legacy,
legacy
I
used
to
be
the
type
of
kid
that
would
always
think
the
sky's
fallin'
Now
I
think
the
fact
that
I'm
differently
wired's
awesome
‘Cause
if
I
wasn't,
I
wouldn't
be
able
to
work
words
like
this
And
connect
lines
like
crosswords
And
use
my
enemy's
words
as
strength
To
try
and
draw
from,
and
get
inspired
off
'em
‘Cause
all
my
life
I
was
told
and
taught
I
am
not
shit
By
you
wack
fuckin'
giant
sacks
of
lyin'
dog
shit
Now
you
shut
up,
bitch,
I
am
talkin'
Thought
I
was
full
of
horseshit
And
now
you
fuckin'
worship
the
ground
on
which
I
am
walkin'
Me
against
the
world,
so
what?
I'm
Brian
Dawkins
Versus
the
whole
0-16
Lions
offense
So
bring
on
the
Giants,
Falcons,
and
Miami
Dolphins
It's
the
body
bag
game,
bitch,
I'm
supplyin'
coffins
‘Cause
you
dicks
butt
kiss,
bunch
of
Brian
Baldingers
You're
gon'
die
a
ball-licker,
I've
been
diabolical
With
this
dialogue
since
'99
Rawkus
You
don't
respect
the
legacy
I
leave
behind,
y'all
can
Suck
a
dick;
the
day
you
beat
me,
pigs'll
fly
out
my
ass
In
a
flyin'
saucer
full
of
Italian
sausage
The
most
high
exaltin'
and
I
ain't
haltin'
'Til
I
die
of
exhaustion,
inhale
my
exhaust
fumes
The
best
part
about
me
is
I
am
not
you
I'm
me,
and
I'm
the
Fire
Marshall,
and
this
is
my—
This
is
my
legacy,
legacy,
yeah
This
is
my
legacy,
legacy,
yeah
There's
no
guarantee
It's
not
up
to
me,
we
can
only
see
This
is
my
legacy,
legacy,
legacy,
legacy
Came
to
the
world
at
a
time
when
it
was
in
need
of
a
villain
An
asshole,
that
role
I
think
I
succeeded
fulfillin'
But
don't
think
I
ever
stopped
To
think
that
I
was
speakin'
to
children
Everything
was
happenin'
so
fast
It
was
like
I
blinked—sold
three
million
Then
it
all
went
blank,
all
I
remember
is
feelin'
ridiculous
‘Cause
I
was
gettin'
sick
of
this
feelin'
Like
I'm
always
under
attack,
man
I
could
have
stacked
my
shit
list
to
the
ceilin'
Women
dishin'
but
really
thinkin':
"If
anyone
ever
talks
to
one
of
my
little
girls
like
this
I
would
kill
him."
Guess
I'm
a
little
bit
of
a
hypocrite
when
I'm
rippin'
shit
But
since
when
did
this
many
people
ever
give
a
shit
What
I
had
to
say?
It's
just
my
opinion
If
it
contradicts
how
I'm
livin',
put
a
dick
in
your
rear
end
That's
why
every
time
you
mentioned
a
lyric
I
thanked
you
for
it,
for
drawin'
more
attention
toward
it
‘Cause
it
gave
me
an
enormous
platform
I'm
flattered
you
thought
I
was
that
important
But
you
can't
ignore
the
fact
that
I
fought
for
the
respect
And
battled
for
it,
mad
awards,
had
GLAAD
annoyed
Atta-boy,
they
told
me
to
slow
down,
I'd
just
zone
out
Good
luck
tryin'
to
convince
a
blonde
It's
like
tellin'
Gwen
Stefani
she
sold
out
‘Cause
I
was
tryna
leave
no
doubt
In
anyone's
mind,
one
day
I'd
go
down
in
history
Think
they
know
now
because
everybody
knows
Everybody
knows
That
you're
just
an
asshole
Everywhere
that
you
go
People
wanna
go
home,
everyone
knows
Everybody
knows
So
don't
pretend
to
be
nice
There's
no
place
you
can
hide
You
are
just
an
asshole
Everyone
knows,
everyone
knows
Thanks
for
the
support,
asshole!
*scratch*
Thanks
for
the
support,
asshole!
Quit
actin'
salty!
I
was
countin'
on
you
to
count
me
out
Ask
Asher
Roth
when
he
roundabout
Dissed
me
to
shout
me
out
Thought
I
was
history,
well
goddamn,
honky
That
compliment's
like
backhandin'
a
donkey
Good
way
to
get
your
ass
socked
in
the
mouth
Nah,
I'm
off
him
But
what
the
fuck's
all
this
trash-talkin'
about?
The
fight
was
fixed,
I'm
back
and
you
can't
stop
me
You
knocked
me
down,
I
went
down
for
the
count
I
fell,
but
the
fans
caught
me,
and
now
You're
gonna
have
to
beat
the
fuckin'
pants
off
me
To
take
my
belt—word
to
Pacquiao
Momma
said
there
ain't
nothin'
else
to
talk
about
Better
go
in
that
ring
and
knock
'em
out
Or
you
better
not
come
out
It's
poetry
in
motion
Like
Freddie
Roach
when
he's
quotin'
Shakespeare
So
what
if
insults
are
revoltin'?
Even
Helen
Keller
knows
life
stinks
You
think
it's
a
joke
'til
you're
bullet-riddled
But
you
should
give
little
shit
what
I
think
This
whole
world
is
a
mess
Gotta
have
a
goddamn
vest
on
your
chest
And
a
Glock
just
to
go
watch
Batman
Who
needs
to
test
a
testicles?
Not
that
man
Half
of
you
don't
got
the
guts,
intestinal
blockage
Rest
of
you
got
lap
bands
Stuck
to
this
motto
'fore
they
put
bath
salts
And
all
those
water
bottles
in
Colorado,
so
get
lost,
Waldo
My
soul's
escapin'
through
this
asshole
that
is
gapin'
A
black
hole
and
I'm
swallowin'
this
track
whole
Better
pack
toilet
paper,
but
I'm
takin'
no
crap,
ho
Here
I
go
down
the
Bat
Pole
And
I'm
changin'
back
into
that
old
maniac
In
fact,
there
they
go
tryna
dip
out
the
back
door
retreatin'
‘Cause
everybody
knows
Everybody
knows
That
you're
just
an
asshole
Everywhere
that
you
go
People
wanna
go
home,
everyone
knows
Everybody
knows
So
don't
pretend
to
be
nice
There's
no
place
you
can
hide
You
are
just
an
asshole
Everyone
knows,
everyone
knows
Holy
mackerel!
I'm
the
biggest
jerk
on
the
planet
Earth
I
smacked
a
girl
off
the
mechanical
bull
at
a
tractor
pull
For
thinkin'
we
had
some
magnetic
pull
Then
screamed,
"ICP
in
this
bitch!
How
do
fuckin'
magnets
work?"
‘Cause
you're
attractive,
but
we
ain't
attractable
Hate
to
be
dramatical,
but
I'm
not
romantical
I'm
makin'
up
words
so
you
can
understandable,
it's
tragical
Thinkin'
some
magical
shit's
gonna
happen,
that
ain't
practical
You
crackin'
a
joke,
it's
laughable
‘Cause
me
and
love's
like
a
bad
combination
I
keep
them
feelings
locked
in
a
vault
So
it's
safe
to
say
I'm
uncrackable
My
heart
is
truly
guarded,
full
body
armor
Bitch,
you
just
need
a
helmet
‘Cause
if
you
think
you're
special,
you're
retarded
Thinkin'
you're
one
of
a
kind
like
you
got
some
platinum
vagina
You're
a
train
wreck,
I
got
a
one-track
mind
Shorty,
you're
fine,
but
you
sort
of
remind
me
of
a
49er
‘Cause
you
been
a
gold
digger
since
you
was
a
minor
Been
tryna
hunt
me
down
like
a
dog
‘Cause
you're
on
my
ass
but
you
can't
get
a
cent
‘Cause
all
of
my
spare
time
is
spent
On
my
nose
in
this
binder,
so
don't
bother
tryin'
Only
women
that
I
love
are
my
daughters
But
sometimes
I
rhyme
and
it
sounds
like
I
forget
I'm
a
father
And
I
push
it
farther
So,
Father,
forgive
me
if
I
forget
to
draw
the
line
It's
apparent
I
shouldn't
have
been
a
parent
I'll
never
grow
up,
so
to
hell
with
your
parents
And
motherfuck
father
time
It
ain't
never
gonna
stop,
a
pessimist
Who
transformed
to
an
optimist
in
his
prime
So
even
if
I'm
half-dead,
I'm
half-alive
Poured
my
half-empty
glass
in
a
cup
Now
my
cup
has
runneth
over
And
I'm
'bout
to
set
it
on
you
like
a
mothafuckin'
coaster
I’m
goin'
back
to
what
got
me
here
Yeah,
cocky,
and
can’t
knock
bein'
rude
off,
so
fear
not,
my
dear
And
dry
up
your
teardrops,
I'm
here
White
America's
mirror,
so
don't
feel
awkward
or
weird
If
you
stare
at
me
and
see
yourself
because
you're
one
too
Shouldn't
be
a
shock,
because
everybody
knows
Everybody
knows
That
you're
just
an
asshole
Everywhere
that
you
go
People
wanna
go
home,
everyone
knows
Everybody
knows
So
don't
pretend
to
be
nice
There's
no
place
you
can
hide
You
are
just
an
asshole
Everyone
knows,
everyone
knows
Now
this
shit's
about
to
kick
off,
this
party
looks
wack
Let's
take
it
back
to
straight
hip-hop
and
start
it
from
scratch
I'm
'bout
to
bloody
this
track
up,
everybody
get
back
That's
why
my
pen
needs
a
pad,
'cause
my
rhymes
on
the
rag
Just
like
I
did
with
addiction,
I'm
'bout
to
kick
it
Like
a
magician,
critics
I
turn
to
crickets
Got
'em
still
on
the
fence
whether
to
picket
But
quick
to
get
it
impaled
when
I
tell
'em,
"Stick
it!"
So
sick,
I'm
looking
pale—wait,
that's
my
pigment
'Bout
to
go
ham,
ya
bish,
shout
out
to
Kendrick
Let's
bring
it
back
to
that
vintage
Slim,
bitch!
The
art
of
MCing
mixed
with
da
Vinci
and
MC
Ren
And
I
don't
mean
Stimpy's
friend,
bitch
Been
Public
Enemy
since
you
thought
PE
was
gym,
bitch
Kick
your
shoes
off,
let
your
hair
down
(And
go
berserk)
All
night
long
Grow
your
beard
out,
just
weird
out
(And
go
berserk)
All
night
long
We're
gonna
rock
this
house
until
we
knock
it
down
So
turn
the
volume
loud
'Cause
it's
mayhem
'til
the
A.M.
So,
baby,
make
just
like
K-Fed
And
let
yourself
go,
let
yourself
go
Say,
"Fuck
it!"
before
we
kick
the
bucket
Life's
too
short
to
not
go
for
broke
So
everybody,
everybody
(Go
berserk)
Grab
your
vial,
yeah
Guess
it's
just
the
way
that
I'm
dressed,
ain't
it?
Khakis
pressed,
Nike
shoes
crispy
and
fresh
laced
So
I
guess
it
ain't
that
aftershave
Or
cologne
that
made
'em
just
faint
Plus
I
showed
up
with
a
coat
fresher
than
wet
paint
So
if
love
is
a
chess
game,
check
mate
But
girl,
your
body's
bangin',
jump
me
in,
dang,
bang-bang
Yes
siree
'Bob',
I
was
thinking
the
same
thang
So
come
get
on
this
Kid's
rock,
baw
with
da
baw,
dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow,
chica,
pow,
chica,
wow-wow
Got
your
gal
blowin'
up
a
valve,
v-v-valve-valve
Ain't
slowin'
it
down,
throw
in
the
towel,
t-t-towel-towel
Dumb
it
down,
I
don't
know
how,
huh-huh,
how-how
At
least
I
know
that
I
don't
know
Question
is,
are
you
bozos
smart
enough
to
feel
stupid?
Hope
so,
now
ho
Kick
your
shoes
off,
let
your
hair
down
(And
go
berserk)
All
night
long
Grow
your
beard
out,
just
weird
out
(And
go
berserk)
All
night
long
We're
gonna
rock
this
house
until
we
knock
it
down
So
turn
the
volume
loud
'Cause
it's
mayhem
'til
the
A.M.
So
crank
the
bass
up
like
crazy
And
let
yourself
go,
let
yourself
go
Say,
"Fuck
it!"
before
we
kick
the
bucket
Life's
too
short
to
not
go
for
broke
So
everybody,
everybody
(Go
berzerk)
Get
your
vinyls
And
they
say
that
love
is
powerful
as
cough
syrup
in
styrofoam
All
I
know
is
I
fell
asleep
and
woke
up
in
that
Monte
Carlo
With
the
ugly
Kardashian,
Lamar,
oh
Sorry,
yo—we
done
both
set
the
bar
low
Far
as
hard
drugs
are
though,
that's
the
past
But
I
done
did
enough
codeine
to
knock
Future
into
tomorrow
And
girl,
I
ain't
got
no
money
to
borrow
But
I
am
tryin'
to
find
a
way
to
get
you
alone:
car
note
Oh,
Marshall
Mathers
Shithead
with
a
potty
mouth,
get
the
bar
of
soap
lathered
Kangol's
and
Carheartless
Cargos
Girl,
you're
fixin'
to
get
your
heart
broke
Don't
be
absurd,
ma'am,
you
birdbrain,
baby
I
ain't
called
anybody
baby
since
Birdman,
unless
you're
a
swallow
(Ha-ha!)
Word,
Rick?
Word,
man,
you
heard
But
don't
get
discouraged,
girl
This
is
your
jam,
unless
you
got
toe
jam
Kick
your
shoes
off,
let
your
hair
down
(And
go
berserk)
All
night
long
Grow
your

just
weird

(And

All

So

(Go

Get
your
vinyls
"Look,
I
was
gonna
go
easy
on
you
not
to
hurt
your
feelings."
"But
I'm
only
going
to
get
this
one
chance."
(Six
minutes—
Six
minutes—)
"Something's
wrong,
I
can
feel
it."
(Six
minutes,
Slim
Shady,
you're
on!)
"Just
a
feeling
I've
got.
Like
something's
about
to
happen,
but
I
don't
know
what.
If
that
means
what
I
think
it
means,
we're
in
trouble,
big
trouble;
And
if
he
is
as
bananas
as
you
say,
I'm
not
taking
any
chances."
"You
are
just
what
the
doc
ordered."
I'm
beginnin'
to
feel
like
a
Rap
God,
Rap
God
All
my
people
from
the
front
to
the
back
nod,
back
nod
Now,
who
thinks
their
arms
are
long
enough
to
slap
box,
slap
box?
They
said
I
rap
like
a
robot,
so
call
me
Rap-bot
But
for
me
to
rap
like
a
computer
it
must
be
in
my
genes
I
got
a
laptop
in
my
back
pocket
My
pen'll
go
off
when
I
half-cock
it
Got
a
fat
knot
from
that
rap
profit
Made
a
livin'
and
a
killin'
off
it
Ever
since
Bill
Clinton
was
still
in
office
With
Monica
Lewinsky
feelin'
on
his
nutsack
I'm
an
MC
still
as
honest
But
as
rude
and
as
indecent
as
all
hell
Syllables,
skill-a-holic
(Kill
'em
all
with)
This
flippity
dippity-hippity
hip-hop
You
don't
really
wanna
get
into
a
pissin'
match
With
this
rappity
brat,
packin'
a
MAC
in
the
back
of
the
Ac'
Backpack
rap
crap,
yap-yap,
yackety-yack
And
at
the
exact
same
time,
I
attempt
these
lyrical
acrobat
stunts
while
I'm
practicin'
that
I'll
still
be
able
to
break
a
motherfuckin'
table
Over
the
back
of
a
couple
of
faggots
and
crack
it
in
half
Only
realized
it
was
ironic,
I
was
signed
to
Aftermath
after
the
fact
How
could
I
not
blow?
All
I
do
is
drop
F-bombs
Feel
my
wrath
of
attack
Rappers
are
havin'
a
rough
time
period,
here's
a
maxi
pad
It's
actually
disastrously
bad
for
the
wack
While
I'm
masterfully
constructing
this
masterpiece
as
'Cause
I'm
beginnin'
to
feel
like
a
Rap
God,
Rap
God
All
my
people
from
the
front
to
the
back
nod,
back
nod
Now,
who
thinks
their
arms
are
long
enough
to
slap
box,
slap
box?
Let
me
show
you
maintainin'
this
shit
ain't
that
hard,
that
hard
Everybody
wants
the
key
and
the
secret
to
rap
immortality
like
Ι
have
got
Well,
to
be
truthful
the
blueprint's
Simply
rage
and
youthful
exuberance
Everybody
loves
to
root
for
a
nuisance
Hit
the
Earth
like
an
asteroid
Did
nothing
but
shoot
for
the
Moon
since
(Pew!)
MCs
get
taken
to
school
with
this
music
'Cause
I
use
it
as
a
vehicle
to
"bus
the
rhyme"
Now
I
lead
a
new
school
full
of
students
Me?
I'm

Shabazz,

N.W.A,
Cube,
hey
Doc,
Ren
Yella,
Eazy,
thank
you,
they
got
Slim
Inspired
enough
to
one
day
grow
up,
blow
up
and
be
in
a
position
To
meet
Run–D.M.C.,
induct
them
Into
the
motherfuckin'
Rock
and
Roll
Hall
of
Fame
Even
though
I'll
walk
in
the
church
and
burst
in
a
ball
of
flames
Only
Hall
of
Fame
I'll
be
inducted
in
is
the
alcohol
of
fame
On
the
wall
of
shame
You
fags
think
it's
all
a
game,
'til
I
walk
a
flock
of
flames
Off
a
plank
and,
tell
me
what
in
the
fuck
are
you
thinkin'?
Little
gay-lookin'
boy
So
gay
I
can
barely
say
it
with
a
straight
face,
lookin'
boy
(Ha-ha!)
You're
witnessin'
a
mass-occur
Like
you're
watching
a
church
gathering
take
place,
lookin'
boy
"Oy
vey,
that
boy's
gay!"—that's
all
they
say,
lookin'
boy
You
get
a
thumbs
up,
pat
on
the
back
And
a
"way
to
go"
from
your
label
every
day,
lookin'
boy
Hey,
lookin'
boy!
What
you
say,
lookin'
boy?
I
get
a
"hell
yeah"
from
Dre,
lookin'
boy
I'ma
work
for
everything
I
have,
never
asked
nobody
for
shit
Get
outta
my
face,
lookin'
boy!
Basically,
boy,
you're
never
gonna
be
capable
Of
keepin'
up
with
the
same
pace,
lookin'
boy,
'cause—
I'm
beginnin'
to
feel
like
a
Rap
God,
Rap
God
All
my
people
from
the
front
to
the
back
nod,
back
nod
The
way
I'm
racin'
around
the
track,
call
me
NASCAR,
NASCAR
Dale
Earnhardt
of
the
trailer
park,
the
White
Trash
God
Kneel
before
General
Zod
This
planet's
Krypton—no,
Asgard,
Asgard
So
you'll
be
Thor,
I'll
be
Odin
You
rodent,
I'm
omnipotent
Let
off,
then
I'm
reloadin'
Immediately
with
these
bombs
I'm
totin'
And
I
should
not
be
woken
I'm
the
walkin'
dead,
but
I'm
just
a
talkin'
head,
a
zombie
floatin'
But
I
got
your
mom
deep-throatin'
I'm
out
my
Ramen
Noodle
We
have
nothin'
in
common,
poodle
I'm
a
Doberman,
pinch
yourself
in
the
arm
and
pay
homage,
pupil
It's
me,
my
honesty's
brutal
But
it's
honestly
futile
if
I
don't
utilize
what
I
do
though
For
good
at
least
once
in
a
while
So
I
wanna
make
sure
somewhere
in
this
chicken
scratch
I
scribble
and
doodle
enough
rhymes
To
maybe
try
to
help
get
some
people
through
tough
times
But
I
gotta
keep
a
few
punchlines
Just
in
case
'cause
even
you
unsigned
Rappers
are
hungry
lookin'
at
me
like
it's
lunchtime
I
know
there
was
a
time
where
once
I
Was
king
of
the
underground
But
I
still
rap
like
I'm
on
my
Pharoahe
Monch
grind
So
I
crunch
rhymes,
but
sometimes
when
you
combine
Appeal
with
the
skin
color
of
mine
You
get
too
big
and
here
they
come
tryin'
To
censor
you
like
that
one
line
I
said
on
"I'm
Back"
from
The
Mathers
LP
1
when
I
Tried
to
say
I'll
take
seven
kids
from
Columbine
Put
'em
all
in
a
line,
add
an
AK-47,
a
revolver
and
a
9
See
if
I
get
away
with
it
now
that
I
ain't
as
big
as
I
was,
but
I'm
Morphin'
into
an
immortal,
comin'
through
the
portal
You're
stuck
in
a
time
warp
from
2004
though
And
I
don't
know
what
the
fuck
that
you
rhyme
for
You're
pointless
as
Rapunzel
with
fuckin'
cornrows
You
write
normal?
Fuck
being
normal!
And
I
just
bought
a
new
raygun
from
the
future
Just
to
come
and
shoot
ya,
like
when
Fabolous
made
Ray
J
mad
'Cause
Fab
said
he
looked
like
a
fag
at
Mayweather's
pad
Singin'
to
a
man
while
he
played
piano
Man,
oh
man,
that
was
a
24/7
special
on
the
cable
channel
So
Ray
J
went
straight
to
the
radio
station
The
very
next
day,
"Hey
Fab,
I'ma
kill
you!"
Lyrics
comin'
at
you
at
supersonic
speed
(J.J.
Fad)
Uh,
summa-lumma,
dooma-lumma,
you
assumin'
I'm
a
human
What
I
gotta
do
to
get
it
through
to
you
I'm
superhuman?
Innovative
and
I'm
made
of
rubber
so
that
anything
you
say
is
ricochetin'
off
of
me
and
it'll
glue
to
you
and
I'm
devastating,
more
than
ever
demonstrating
How
to
give
a
motherfuckin'
audience
a
feeling
like
it's
levitating
Never
fading,
and
I
know
the
haters
are
forever
waiting
For
the
day
that
they
can
say
I
fell
off,
they'll
be
celebrating
'Cause
I
know
the
way
to
get
'em
motivated
I
make
elevating
music,
you
make
elevator
music
"Oh,
he's
too
mainstream."
Well,
that's
what
they
do
when
they
get
jealous,
they
confuse
it
"It's
not
hip-hop,
it's
pop,"—'cause
I
found
a
hella
way
to
fuse
it
With
rock,
shock
rap
with
Doc
Throw
on
"Lose
Yourself"
and
make
'em
lose
it
"I
don't
know
how
to
make
songs
like
that
I
don't
know
what
words
to
use."
Let
me
know
when
it
occurs
to
you
While
I'm
rippin'
any
one
of
these
verses
that
versus
you
It's
curtains,
I'm
inadvertently
hurtin'
you
How
many
verses
I
gotta
murder
to
Prove
that
if
you
were
half
as
nice,
your
songs
you
could
sacrifice
virgins
too?!
Ugh,
school
flunky,
pill
junkie
But
look
at
the
accolades
these
skills
brung
me
Full
of
myself,
but
still
hungry
I
bully
myself
'cause
I
make
me
do
what
I
put
my
mind
to
And
I'm
a
million
leagues
above
you
Ill
when
I
speak
in
tongues,
but
it's
still
tongue-in-cheek,
fuck
you
I'm
drunk,
so,
Satan,
take
the
fucking
wheel
I'ma
sleep
in
the
front
seat
Bumpin'
Heavy
D
and
the
Boyz,
still
"Chunky
but
Funky"
But
in
my
head
there's
something
I
can
feel
tugging
and
struggling
Angels
fight
with
devils
and
here's
what
they
want
from
me
They're
askin'
me
to
eliminate
some
of
the
women
hate
But
if
you
take
into
consideration
the
bitter
hatred
I
have,
then
you
may
be
a
little
patient
And
more
sympathetic
to
the
situation
And
understand
the
discrimination
But
fuck
it,
life's
handin'
you
lemons?
Make
lemonade
then!
But
if
I
can't
batter
the
women
How
the
fuck
am
I
supposed
to
bake
them
a
cake
then?!
Don't
mistake
him
for
Satan;
it's
a
fatal
mistake
If
you
think
I
need
to
be
overseas
and
take
a
vacation
To
trip
a
broad,
and
make
her
fall
on
her
face
and
Don't
be
a
retard—be
a
king?
Think
not
Why
be
a
king
when
you
can
be
a
God?
Or
Eminem

"Who
can
say
for
sure?
Perhaps
a
frontal
lobotomy
would
be
the
answer.
If
science
could
operate
on
this
distorted
brain
and
put
it
to
good
use,
society
would
reap
a
great
benefit."
I
walk
around
like
a
space
cadet,
place
your
bets
Who's
likely
to
become
a
serial
killer?
Case
of
Tourettes
Fuck,
fuck-fuck,
can't
take
the
stress
I
make
a
mess
as
the
day
progresses
Angry
and
take
it
out
on
the
neighbors'
hedges
Like
this
is
how
I'll
cut
your
face
up,
bitches,
with
these
hedge-trimmin'
scissors
with
razor
edges
Imagination's
dangerous,
it's
the
only
way
to
escape
this
mess
And
make
the
best
of
this
situation,
I
guess
'Cause
I
feel
like
a
little
bitch,
this
predicament's
Despicable,
I'm
sick
of
just
gettin'
pushed,
it's
ridiculous
I
look
like
a
frickin'
wuss,
a
pussy,
this
kid
just
took
My
stick
of
licorice
and
threw
my
sticker
books
in
a
picker
bush
I
wanna
kick
his
tush,
but
I
was
six
and
shook
This
fucker
was
12
and
was
six
foot,
with
a
vicious
hook
He
hit
me,
I
fell;
I
got
back
up,
all
I
did
was
book
Now
there's
usin'
your
head,
Momma
always
said—
"If
you
had
a
brain,
you'd
be
dangerous
A
brain,
you'd
be
dangerous"
(I'ma
prove
you
wrong)
Momma,
I'ma
grow
one
day
to
be
famous
And
I'ma
be
a
pain
in
the
anus
(I'ma
be
the
bomb)
I'ma
use
my
head
as
a
weapon
Find
a
way
to
escape
this
insaneness
(Momma
always
said)
"Son,
if
you
had
a
brain,
you'd
be
dangerous."
Guess
it
pays
to
be
brainless
Fast
forward
some
years
later,
a
teenager;
this
is
fun,
sweet
I
just
got
jumped
twice
in
one
week,
it's
complete
It's
usually
once
a
month,
this
is
some
feat
I've
accomplished
They've
stomped
me
into
the
mud,
gee,
for
what
reason
you
stumped
me?
But
how
do
you
get
the
shit
beat
out
of
you,
beat
down
And
be
upbeat
when
you
don't
have
nothing?
No
valid
shot
at
life,
chance
to
make
it
or
succeed
'Cause
you're
doomed
from
the
start,
it's
like
you
grew
up
on
Jump
Street,
from
jump
street
But
if
I
could
just
get
my
head
out
my
ass
I
could
accomplish
any
task,
practicin'
trash-talkin'
in
a
trance
Locked
in
my
room,
yeah,
but
I
got
some
plans,
Momma
These
damn
rhymes
are
fallin'
out
of
my
pants
pocket,
I
can't
stop
it!
And
I'm
startin'
to
blend
in
more,
in
school
this
shit
helps
for
sure
I'm
gettin'
more
self-assured
than
I've
ever
been
before
Plus
no
one
picks
on
me
anymore
I
done
put
a
stop
to
that,
threw
my
first
punch—end
of
story
Still,
in
my
skull’s
a
vacant
empty
void,
been
usin'
it
more
as
a
bin
for
storage
Take
some
inventory:
in
this
gourd
there's
a
Ford
engine
Door
hinge,
syringe,
an
orange,
an
extension
cord,
and
a
ninja
sword
Not
to
mention
four
linchpins,
an
astringent
stored
Ironin'
board,
a
bench,
a
wrench,
a
ore
winch,
an
attention
whore
Everything
but
a
brain,
but
dome's
off
the
fuckin'
chain
Like
an
independent
store,
something's
wrong
with
my
Head,
just
think
if
I
had
a
brain
in
it,
thank
God
that
I
Don't,
'cause
I'd
probably
be
Dahmer,
'cause
Momma
always
said—
"If
you
had
a
brain,
you'd
be
dangerous
A
brain,
you'd
be
dangerous"
(I'ma
prove
you
wrong)
Momma,
I'ma
grow
one
day
to
be
famous
And
I'ma
be
a
pain
in
the
anus
(I'ma
be
the
bomb)
I'ma
use
my
head
as
a

Find
a

to
escape
this
insaneness
(Momma

"Son,
if
you
had

you'd
be

Guess
it
pays
to
be
brainless
Now
my
mom
goes
wahm-wahm-wahm
'Cause
I'm
not
that
smart,
but
I'm
not
dumb
I
was
on
the
bottom
of
the
pile,
gettin'
stomped
But
somehow
I
came
out
on
top
I
told
you
one
day,
I
said
they'd
have
that
red
carpet
rolled
out,
yo
I'm
nice,
y'all,
fuck
it,
I'm
out
cold,
now
everywhere
I
go
They
scream
out,
"Go!",
I'm
'bout
to
clean
house,
yo
I'm
Lysol,
now
I'm
just
household
Outsold
the
sell-outs,
freak
the
hell
out
Middle
America
Hear
'em
yell
out
in
terror,
they
were
so
scared,
and
those
kids
Just
about
belted
out
whatever
spouted
Or
fell
out
my
smart
aleck
mouth,
it
was
so
weird
Inappropriate?
So
be
it,
I
don't
see
it
Maybe
one
day
when
the
smoke
clears,
it
won't
be
as
Motherfuckin'
difficult,
yeah
'Til
then,
hopefully
you
little
homos
get
over
your
fears
and
phobias
It's
okay
to
be
scared
straight,
they
said
I
provoke
queers
'Til
emotions
evoke
tears,
my
whole
career's
A
stroke
of
sheer
genius,
smoke
and
mirrors,
tactical,
practical
jokes,
yeah
You
motherfuckin'—
insert
insult
here
Who
the
fuck
woulda
thunk
that
one
little
ole
MC'd
Be
able
to
take
the
whole
culture
and
reupholster
it?
And
boy,
they
did
flock;
can't
believe
this
little
hick
locked
This
hip-hop
shit
in
his
hip
pocket,
and
still
the
shit
got
That
white-trash
traffic
in
gridlock,
shit
hoppin'
like
six
blocks
From
a
Kid
Rock/Insane
Clown
Posse
concert
in
mid-Oc-
-tober,
and
God
forbid
I
see
a
wizard
And
get
a
brain
in
my
titanium
cranium,
y'all
'Cause
I'll
turn
into
the
Unabomber,
Momma
always
said—
"If
you
had
a
brain,
you'd
be
dangerous
A
brain,
you'd
be
dangerous"
(I'ma
prove
you
wrong)
Momma,
I'ma
grow
one
day
to
be
famous
And
I'ma
be
a
pain
in
the
anus
(I'ma
be
the
bomb)
I'ma
use
my
head
as
a
weapon
Find
a
way
to
escape
this
insaneness
(Momma
always
said)
"Son,
if
you
had
a
brain,
you'd
be
dangerous."
Guess
it
pays
to
be
brainless
"Insaneness"
ain't
even
a
word,
you
stupid
fuck!
Neither
is
"ain't"
You
used
to
say
that
I'd
never
be
Nothin'
without
you,
and
I'd
believe
I'm
shot
in
the
lungs,
I
gasp,
I
can't
breathe
Just
lay
here
with
me,
baby,
hold
me
please
And
I'd
beg
and
I'd
plead,
drop
to
knees
And
I'd
cry
and
I'd
scream,
"Baby,
please
don't
leave!"
Snatch
the
keys
from
your
hand,
I
would
squeeze
And
you'd
laugh,
and
you'd
tease
You're
just
fucking
with
me,
and
you
must
hate
me
Why
do
you
date
me,
if
you
say
I
make
you
sad
?
And
you've
had
enough
of
me
I
smother
you,
I'm
'bout
to
jump
off
the
edge
But
you
won't
break
me
You'll
just
make
me
stronger
than
I
was
Before
I
met
you,
I
bet
you
I'll
be
just
fine
without
you
And
if
I
stumble,
I
won't
crumble
I'll
get
back
up
and
uhh
But
I'ma
still
be
humble
when
I
scream
"Fuck
you!"
‘Cause
I'm
stronger
than
I
was
A
beautiful
face
is
all
that
you
have
‘Cause
on
the
inside
you're
ugly
and
mad
But
you're
all
that
I
love,
I
grasp,
you
can't
leave
Please
stay
here
with
me,
baby,
hold
me
please
And
I'd
beg
and
I'd
plead,
drop
to
knees
And
I'd
cry
and
I'd
scream,
"Baby,
please
don't
leave!"
But
you
left
and
you
took
everything
I
had
left
And
left
nothin',
nothin'
for
me
So,
please
don't
wake
me
from
this
dream,
baby
We're
still
together
in
my
head
And
you're
still
in
love
with
me
'Til
I
woke
up
to
discover
that
that
dream
was
dead
But
you
won't
break
me
You'll
just
make
me
stronger
than
I
was
Before
I
met
you,
I
bet
you
I'll
be
just
fine
without
you
And
if
I
stumble,
I
won't
crumble
I'll
get
back
up
and
uhh
But
I'ma
still
be
humble
when
I
scream
"Fuck
you!"
‘Cause
I'm
stronger
than
I
was
You
walked
out,
I
almost
died
It
was
almost
a
homicide
That
you
caused,
‘cause
I
was
so
traumatized
Felt
like
I
was
in
for
a
long
bus
ride
I'd
rather
die
than
you
not
be
by
my
side
Can't
count
how
many
times
I
vomited,
cried
Go
to
my
room,
turn
the
radio
on
and
hide
Thought
we
were
Bonnie
and
Clyde
Nah,
on
the
inside
you
were
Jekyll
and
Hyde
I
felt
like
my
whole
relationship
with
you
was
a
lie
It
was
you
and
I,
why
did
I
think
it
was
ride
or
die?
‘Cause
if
you
coulda
took
my
life
you
woulda
It's
like
you
put
a
knife
through
my
chest
And
pushed
it
right
through
to
the
Other
side
of
my
back
and
stuck
a
spike
too,
shoulda
Put
up
more
of
a
fight,
but
I
couldn't
At
the
time,
no
one
could
hurt
me
like
you
coulda
Take
you
back
now,
what's
the
likelihood
of
that?
Bite
me,
bitch,
chew
on
a
nineteen
footer!
‘Cause
this
morning
I
finally
stood
up
Held
my
chin
up,
finally
showed
a
sign
of
life
in
me
for
the
First
time
since
you
left
And
left
me
with
nothin'
but
shattered
dreams
And
the
life
we
coulda
had
and
we
coulda
been
But
I'm
breakin'
out
of
this
slump
I'm
in
Pullin'
myself
out
of
the
dumps
once
again
I'm
gettin'
up
once
and
for
all—fuck
this
shit!
I'ma
be
late
for
the
pity
party
But
you're
never
gonna
beat
me
to
the
fuckin'
punch
again
Took
it
on
the
chin
like
a
champ
So
don't
lump
me
in
with
them
chump-ions
I'm
done
bein'
your
punching
bag
It
was
the
November
31st
today
Woulda
been
our
anniversary
Two
years,
but
you
left
on
the
1st
of
May
I
wrote
it
on
a
calendar,
was
gonna
call
But
couldn't
think
of
the
words
to
say
But
they
came
to
me
just
now—so
I
put
'em
in
a
verse
to
lay
And
I
thank
you,
‘cause
you
made
me
A
better
person
than
I
was
But
I
hate
you,
‘cause
you
drained
me
I
gave
you
all,
you
gave
me
none
But
if
you
blame
me,
you're
crazy
And
after
all
is
said
and
done
I'm
still
angry,
yeah,
I
may
be
I
may
never
trust
someone
But
you
won't
break
me
You'll
just
make
me
stronger
than
I
was
Before
I
met
you,
I
bet
you
I'll
be
just
fine
without
you
And
if
I
stumble,
I
won't
crumble
I'll
get
back
up
and
uhh
But
I'ma
still
be
humble
when
I
scream
"Fuck
you!"
‘Cause
I'm
stronger
than
I
was
I'm
friends
with
the
monster
that's
under
my
bed
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
You're
tryin'
to
save
me,
stop
holdin'
your
breath
And
you
think
I'm
crazy,
yeah,
you
think
I'm
crazy
I
wanted
the
fame
but
not
the
cover
of
Newsweek
Oh
well,
guess
beggars
can't
be
choosey
Wanted
to
receive
attention
for
my
music
Wanted
to
be
left
alone
in
public,
excuse
me
For
wantin'
my
cake,
and
eat
it
too,
and
wantin'
it
both
ways
Fame
made
me
a
balloon
‘cause
my
ego
inflated
When
I
blew,
see,
but
it
was
confusing
‘Cause
all
I
wanted
to
do's
be
the
Bruce
Lee
of
loose
leaf
Abused
ink,
used
it
as
a
tool
when
I
blew
steam
Whoo!
Hit
the
lottery,
ooh-wee
But
with
what
I
gave
up
to
get
it
was
bittersweet
It
was
like
winnin'
a
used
mink
Ironic
‘cause
I
think
I'm
gettin'
so
huge
I
need
a
shrink
I'm
beginnin'
to
lose
sleep:
one
sheep,
two
sheep
Goin'
coo-coo
and
kooky
as
Kool
Keith
But
I'm
actually
weirder
than
you
think,
‘cause
I'm—
I'm
friends
with
the
monster
that's
under
my
bed
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
You're
tryin'
to
save
me,
stop
holdin'
your
breath
And
you
think
I'm
crazy,
yeah,
you
think
I'm
crazy
Well,
that's
nothin'
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well,
that's
nothin'
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now,
I
ain't
much
of
a
poet
But
I
know
somebody
once
told
me
to
seize
the
moment
And
don't
squander
it
‘cause
you
never
know
when
it
all
Could
be
over
tomorrow,
so
I
keep
conjurin'
Sometimes
I
wonder
where
these
thoughts
spawn
from
Yeah,
ponderin'll
do
you
wonders
No
wonder
you're
losin'
your
mind,
the
way
it
wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I
think
it
went
wanderin'
off
down
yonder
And
stumbled
onto
Jeff
VanVonderen
‘Cause
I
need
an
interventionist
To
intervene
between
me
and
this
monster
And
save
me
from
myself
and
all
this
conflict
‘Cause
the
very
thing
that
I
love's
killin'
me
and
I
can't
conquer
it
My
OCD's
conkin'
me
in
the
head,
keep
knockin'
Nobody's
home,
I'm
sleepwalkin'
I'm
just
relayin'
what
the
voice
in
my
head's
sayin'
Don't
shoot
the
messenger,
I'm
just
friends
with
the—
I'm
friends
with
the
monster
that's
under
my
bed
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
You're
tryin'
to
save
me,
stop
holdin'
your
breath
And
you
think
I'm
crazy,
yeah,
you
think
I'm
crazy
Well,
that's
nothin'
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well,
that's
nothin'
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Call
me
crazy,
but
I
have
this
vision,
one
day
that
I'll
walk
amongst
you
a
regular
civilian
But
until
then,
drums
get
killed
and
I'm
comin'
straight
at
MC's,
blood
gets
spilled
and
I'll
take
you
back
to
the
days
that
I'd
get
on
a
Dre
track
Give
every
kid
who
got
played
that
pumped-up
feelin'
And
shit
to
say
back
to
the
kids
who
played
him
I
ain't
here
to
save
the
fuckin'
children
But
if
one
kid
out
of
a
hundred
million
Who
are
goin'
through
a
struggle,
feels
it
and
relates,
that's
great!
It's
payback,
Russell
Wilson
fallin'
way
back
In
the
draft,
turn
nothin'
into
somethin',
still
can
make
that
Straw
into
gold,
chump,
I
will
spin—Rumpelstiltskin
in
a
haystack
Maybe
I
need
a
straightjacket
Face
facts:
I
am
nuts
for
real,
but
I'm
okay
with
that!
It's
nothin',
I'm
still
friends
with
the—
I'm
friends
with
the
monster
that's
under
my
bed
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
You're
tryin'
to
save
me,
stop
holdin'
your
breath
And
you
think
I'm
crazy,
yeah,
you
think
I'm
crazy
I'm
friends
with
the
monster
that's
under
my
bed
(Get
along
with)
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
(You're
tryin'
to)
You're
tryin'
to
save
me,
stop
holdin'
your
breath
(And
you

And
you

I'm

yeah,
you

I'm

Well,
that's

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well,
that's

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I
own
a
mansion
but
live
in
a
house
A
king-size
bed
but
I
sleep
on
the
couch
I'm
Mr.
Brightside,
glass
is
half-full
But
my
tank's
half
empty,
gasket
just
blew
This
always
happens
Thirty
minutes
from
home,
gotta
lay
a
log
cabin
Only
option
I
have's
McDonalds's
bathroom
In
a
public
stall,
droppin'
a
football
So
every
time
someone
walks
in
the
john,
I
get
maddened
"Shady,
what
up?"
What?
Come
on,
man,
I'm
crappin'
And
you're
askin'
for
my
goddamn
autograph
on
a
napkin?
Oh,
that's
odd,
I
just
happened
To
run
out
of
tissue,
yeah,
hand
me
that
On
second
thought
I'd
be
glad
then
"Thanks,
dawg!
Name's
Todd,
a
big
fan."
I
wiped
my
ass
with
it
Crumbled
it
up
in
a
wad
and
threw
it
back
and
Told
him:
"Todd,
you're
the
shit,"
when's
all
of
this
crap
end?
Can't
pump
my
gas
without
causing
an
accident
Pump
my
gas,
cut
my
grass,
I
can't
take
out
the
fuckin'
trash
Without
someone
passin'
through
my
sub,
harassin'
I'd
count
my
blessings,
but
I
suck
at
math
I'd
rather
wallow
than
bask
sufferin'
succotash
But
the
ant-acid,
it
gives
my
stomach
gas
When
I
mix
my
corn
with
my
fuckin'
mashed
Potatoes,
so
what?
Ho,
kiss
my
country
bumpkin
ass!
Missouri
Southern
roots,
what
the
fuck
is
upper
class?
Call
lunch
dinner,
call
dinner
supper
Tupperware
in
the
cupboard,
plasticware
up
the
ass
Stuck
in
the
past—iPod,
what
the
fuck
is
that?
B-Boy
to
the
core,
mule,
I'm
a
stubborn
ass
Maybe
that's
why
I
feel
so
strange
Got
it
all,
but
I
still
won't
change
Maybe
that's
why
I
can't
leave
Detroit
It's
the
motivation
that
keeps
me
goin'
This
is
the
inspiration
I
need
I
can
never
turn
my
back
on
the
city
that
made
me
And
(life's
been
good
to
me
so
far)
They
call
me
classless,
I
heard
that,
I
second
and
third
that
Don't
know
what
the
fuck
I'd
be
doin'
if
it
weren't
rap
Probably
be
a
giant
turd
sack
But
I
blew,
never
turned
back
Turned
40
and
still
sag—teenagers
act
more
fuckin'
mature,
Jack
Fuck
you
gonna
say
to
me?
I
leave
on
my
own
terms,
asshole
I'm
goin'
berzerk,
my
nerves
are
bad
But
I
love
the
perks
my
work
has
I
get
to
meet
famous
people,
look
at
her
dag
Her
nylons
are
ran,
her
skirt's
snagged
And
I
heard
she
drag-races,
*burp*
swag
Tuck
in
my
Hanes
shirt
tag
You're
Danica
Patrick
(Yeah?)
word,
skag
We'd
be
the
perfect
match
'Cause
you're
a
vacuum,
I'm
a
dirtbag
My
apologies,
no
disrespect
to
technology
But
what
the
heck
is
all
of
these
buttons?
You
expect
me
to
sit
here
and
learn
that?
Fuck
I
gotta
do
to
hear
this
new
song
from
Luda?
Be
an
expert
at
computers?
I'd
rather
be
an
Encyclopedia
Britannica,
hell
with
PlayStation,
I'm
still
on
my
first
man
on
some
Zelda
Nintendo,
bitch!
Run,
jump,
punch,
stab,
and
I
melt
the
Mozzarella
on
my
spaghetti
Put
in
on
bread,
make
a
sandwich
with
Welch's,
and
belch
They
say
this
spray
butter
is
bad
for
my
health,
but
I
think
this
poor
white
trash
from
the
trailer
Jed
Clampett,
Fred
Sanford,
and
welfare
Mentality
helps
to
keep
me
grounded
That's
why
I
never
take
full
advantage
of
wealth,
I
Managed
to
dwell
within
these
parameters
Still
crammin'
the
shelves
full
of
Hamburger
Helper
I
can't
even
help
it,
this
is
the
hand
I
was
dealt,
a
Creature
of
habit,
feel
like
I'm
trapped
in
an
animal
shelter
With
all
these
pet
peeves,
goddamn
it,
to
hell,
I
Can't
stand
all
these
kids
with
their
camera
cellphones
I
can't
go
anywhere,
I
get
so
mad
I
could
yell,
the
Other
day,
someone
got
all
elaborate
And
stuck
a
head
from
a
fuckin'
dead
cat
in
my
mailbox
Went
to
Burger
King—they
spit
on
my
onion
rings
I
think
my
karma
is
catchin'
up
with
me
Maybe
that's
why
I
feel
so
strange
Got
it
all,
but
I
still
won't
change
Maybe
that's
why
I
can't
leave
Detroit
It's
the
motivation
that
keeps
me
goin'
This
is
the
inspiration
I
need
I
can
never
turn
my
back
on
the
city
that
made
me
And
(life's
been
good
to
me
so
far)
Got
friends
on
Facebook
all
over
the
world
Not
sure
what
that
means,
they
tell
me
it's
good
So,
I'm
artist
of
the
decade,
I
even
got
a
plaque
I'd
hang
it
up,
but
the
frame
is
all
cracked
I'm
tryin'
to
be
low-key,
hopefully
nobody
notices
me
In
produce,
hunched
over,
giant
nosebleed
Ogre
style
as
I
mosey
over
to
the
frozen
aisle
By
the
frozen
yogurt
this
guy
approached
me
Embarrassed,
I
just
did
Comerica
with
Hova
The
show's
over,
I'm
hidin'
in
Kroger,
buyin'
groceries
He
just
had
front-row
seats
Told
me
to
sign
this
poster,
then
insults
me
"Wow!
Up
close
didn't
know
you
had
crow's
feet!"
I'm
in
the
crossroads,
lost,
still
shoppin'
at
Costco's
Sloppy
Joe's,
bulk
waffles
Got
caught
picking
my
nose
(agh!)
Look
over,
see
these
two
hot
hoes
Finger
still
up
one
of
my
nostrils
Right
next
to
'em,
stuck
at
the
light,
the
fuckin'
shit's
Takin'
forever
to
change,
it's
stuck,
these
bitches
are
lovin'
it
Rubbin'
it
in,
chucklin',
couldn't
do
nothin'
Play
it
off,
"What
you
bumpin'?"
"Trunk
Muzik,
Yelawolf's
better,"
fuckin'
bitch!
They
want
me
to
flip
at
the
label,
but
I
won't
succumb
to
it
The
pressure,
they
want
me
to
follow
up
with
Another
one,
after
Recovery
was
so
highly
coveted
But
what
good
is
a
fuckin'
recovery
if
I
fumble
it?
'Cause
I'ma
drop
the
ball
if
I
don't
get
a
grip
Hoppin'
out
shrubbery
on
you
sons
of
bitches
Wrong
subdivision
to
fuck
with,
bitch
Quit
snappin'
fuckin'
pictures
of
my
kids
I
love
my
city,
but
you
pushed
me
to
the
limit—what
a
pity!
The
shit
I
complain
about
It's
like
there
ain't
a
cloud
in
the
sky
and
it's
rainin'
out
Kool-Aid
stain
on
the
couch,
I'll
never
get
it
out
But
bitch,
I
got
an
elevator
in
my
house
Ants
and
a
mouse—I'm
livin'
the
dream!
Maybe
that's
why
I
feel
so
strange
Got
it
all,
but
I
still
won't
change
Maybe
that's
why
I
can't
leave
Detroit
It's
the
motivation
that
keeps
me
goin'
This
is
the
inspiration
I
need
I
can
never
turn
my
back
on
the
city
that
made
me
And
(life's
been
good
to
me
so
far)
Something's
burnin',
I
can't
figure
out
what
(out
what)
It's
either
lust
or
a
cloud
of
dust
Judgement
is
clouded;
must
Just
be
the
powder
from
the
power
of
(love)
But
I'm
in
something
I
don't
know
how
to
get
out
of
Left
my
girl
in
the
house
alone
Is
that
my
soon-to-be-spouse’s
moan?
And
the
further
I
walk,
the
louder
Pause
for
a
minute
to
make
certain
that's
what
I
heard
‘Cause
after
all,
this
is
her
place
So
I
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt,
I
Think
I
might
be
about
to
bust
her,
bust
her
The
thought's
scary,
yo,
though
and
it
hurts—brace!
Hope
it
ain't,
"Here
we
go,
yo!"
‘Cause
my
head
already
goes
to
worst-case
Scenario,
though
in
the
first
place
But
you
confirmed
my
low-end
theory
though
Should've
known
when
I
made
it
all
the
way
to
third
base
And
that
was
only
the
first
date
Could've
made
it
to
home
plate
But
you
slid
straight
for
the
dome
and
dove
face
first
"No,
(*slurp*)
you
don't
(*slurp*)
under—
(*slurp*)
—stand,
(*slurp*)
I
(*slurp*)
don't
(*slurp*)
do
this
for
(*hic*)
anyone,
(*hic*)
ever
(*slurp*)."
Yeah,
that
ain't
what
they
all
say?
I'll
say,
you
can
suck
a
softball
through
a
straw
Used
to
be
my
fiancé
'Til
you
sucked
on
Wayne,
André,
and
Kanye
LeBron,
Akon,
Jay,
Lil
Jon,
Raekwon,
Ma$e
Polow
da
Don,
Dre,
Dante
Ross,
James
Conway,
Kwamé
Guess
I'm
gettin'
my
g-goddang
Jigga
on,
eh?
‘Cause
your
name,
I'm
beyond
sayin'
But
fuck
it,
I'm
movin'
on,
you
women
are
all
cray
But
I'll
probably
always
keep
on
playin'
the—
Game
of
love,
love,
love,
love
La-la-la-la-la
love
She
doesn't
love
me,
no,
she
don't
love
me
no
more
She
hates
my
company,
guess
she
don't
love
me
no
more
I
tried
to
get
her
up
out
of
my
head,
left
my
bags
at
the
door
She
screamed
she
loved
me
like
she
never
did
before
And
I
told
her,
"Go
where
you
wanna!
Go
do
whatcha
wanna
do,
I
don't
care!"
And
I
told
her,
"Go
where
you
wanna!
Go
do
whatcha
wanna
do,
I
don't
care!"
I
told
that
bitch,
"I'm
a
sucker
for
love,
you
a
sucker
for
dick."
Suckin'
dick
in
your
mama
tub,
then
your
granny
walked
in
Told
the
stupid
nigga
to
duck
under
the
water
He
drowned,
like
an
abortion
They
booked
you
for
manslaughter
You
beat
the
case
and
I
called
ya
"Sherane
is
not
available
now,
leave
a
message
at
the
tone
And
Kendrick,
don't
forget
to
buy
two
pair
of
those
Expensive
heels,
you
little
fuckin'
Ferris
wheel
Fuckin'
spinnin'
on
me—fuck
you
think,
we
gon'
get
married
still?
Fuckin'
Mary
had
a
little
lamb,
this
ain't
no
fairy
tale
Fairy
godmama
better
tell
you
how
I
fuckin'
feel
Like
you
should
fuckin'
beat
it
Or
fuckin'
eat
it
while
I'm
on
my
period
Now
have
a
blessed
day."
(*Phone
hangs
up*)
Bitch,
you
serious?
I'm
in
the
mirror
with
this
look
on
my
face,
curious
Why
you
ain't
fuckin'
with
me,
you
cut
me
deep
as
Caesarean
You
know
I
want
you
bad
as
a
Benjamin,
I'm
delirious
I
want
you
bad
as
the
head
shattered
on
George
Zimmerman
After
the
Dillinger
hit
him
diligently
and
killin'
him
His
mouthpiece
for
a
Cadillac
emblem
That's
analogy
and
metaphor
for
you
I
should
win
a
medal
for
all
the
ways
I
adore
you
This
is
me
talkin'
cordial,
yeah,
I
got
some
home
training
That
ain't
what
you
like,
ain't
it?
What
about
if
I
was
as
famous
as
Marshall?
Would
you
give
fellatio
in
the
carpool?
Cops
pull
us
over,
they
just
wanna
know
if
you
gargle
Singin',
"I
hope
she's
good
enough
Meanwhile
you're
chasin'
her"
Chlamydia
couldn't
even
get
rid
of
her
Pity
the
fool
and
pity
the
fool
in
me,
I'ma
live
with
the—
Game
of
love,
love,
love,
love
La-la-la-la-la
love
(She
doesn't
love
me,
no,
she
don't
love
me
no
more)
(She
hates
my
company,
guess
she
don't
love
me
no
more)
I
tried
to
get
her
up
out
of
my
head,
left
my
bags
at
the
door
She
screamed
she
loved
me
like
she
never
did
before
And
I
told
her,
"Go
where
you
wanna!
Go
do
whatcha
wanna
do,
I
don't
care!"
And
I
told
her,
"Go
where
you
wanna!
Go
do
whatcha
wanna
do,
I
don't
care!"
So
needless
to
say
I'm
feelin'
betrayed
Snatch
my
house
key
off
her
key
chain
She
jumps
off
Wee-Bey
from
The
Wire's
dick
Now
she's
chasin'
me
with
a
cheese
grater
Here
goes
that
broken
record
cliché
It's
all
my
fault
anyway,
she's
turnin'
the
tables,
I'm
a
beat-break
She
treats
my
face
like
Serato,
she
cuts
and
scratches
like
a
DJ
Each
day
is
an
Instant
Replay
They
say
what
we
display
is
symptomatic
of
addict
behavior
Back
together,
but
forgot
today
was
her
B-day
She
cut
me
off
on
the
freeway
Simple
misunderstanding,
but
just
as
I
went
to
slam
on
the
brakes
That's
when
I
realized
that
she
may
be
crazy
as
me,
wait
Bitch
cut
my
fuckin'
brakeline
Stepped
on
them
fuckers
eight
times
Still
goin'
73,
thank
God
there's
an
exit
comin'
up
What
the
mother-F-U-C-K's
wrong
with
her?
Hit
the
off
ramp
'til
I
coasted
to
a
goshdamn
halt
Hit
a
fuckin'
tree,
now
here
she
comes
at
full
speed
She's
racin'
at
me,
okay,
you
wanna
fuck
with
me,
eh?
Snatch
that
bitch
out
her
car
through
the
window
She
screamin',
I
body
slam
her
on
the
cement
Until
the
concrete
gave
and
created
a
sinkhole
Buried
the
stink
ho
in
it,
then
paid
to
have
the
street
repaved
(The
fuck?)
Woke
up
in
a
dream
state
In
a
cold
sweat
like
I
got
hit
with
a
freeze
ray
during
a
heat
wave
Guess
I
eventually
caved
though,
‘cause
she's
layin'
next
to
me
in
bed—directly
aimin'
a
gat
at
my
head!
Woke
up
again
and
jumped
up
Like,
"Fuck
it!
I've
had
it,
I'm
checkin'
into
rehab."
I
confess
I'm
a
static
addict,
I
guess
that's
why
I'm
so
clingy
Every
girl
I've
ever
had
either
says
I
got
too
much
baggage
Or
I'm
too
fuckin'
dramatic
Man,
what
the
fuck
is
the
matter?
I'm
just
a
fuckin'
romantic
I
fuckin'
love
you,
you
fuckin'
bitch!
Combative,
possessive,
in
fact
last
time
I
was
mad
at
an
ex
I
actually
set
off
a
chain
reaction
of
tragic
events
I
said,
"Hit
the
road",
then
after
she
left
I
sent
that
bitch
a
text
that
said,
"Be
careful
driving
Don't
read
this
and
have
an
accident"
She
glanced
to
look
at
it
and
wrecked
(*Car
crashes*)
Too
bad,
thought
we
had
a
connect
No
sense
dwelling
makes,
never
been
a
more
compelling
case
Than
the
model
covered
in
L'Oréal
and
mace

While
the

was

"Rape!"
'Til
her

And
her

Still
they
swarm
the
gates
of
my

To

Andrea
Yates,
don't
ask
me
for
a
date
though
You're
late,
well,
the
sentiment's
great
But
wait,
think
there's
been
a
mistake
You
wanted
an
intimate
date,
I
wanna
intimidate
I
have
infinite
hate
in
my
blood
It's

'cause
of

Wait,
"dinner
at
eight"?
I
have
infinite
hate
in
my

It's

'cause
of

La-la-la-la-la

Mom,
I
know
I
let
you
down
And
though
you
say
the
days
are
happy
Why
is
the
power
off
and
I'm
fucked
up?
And,
Mom,
I
know
he's
not
around
But
don't
you
place
the
blame
on
me
As
you
pour
yourself
another
drink,
yeah
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night,
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
I
went
in
headfirst,
never
thinkin'
about
who
what
I
said
hurt
In
what
verse,
my
mom
probably
got
it
the
worst
The
brunt
of
it,
but
as
stubborn
as
we
are,
did
I
take
it
too
far?
"Cleanin'
Out
My
Closet"
and
all
them
other
songs
But
regardless,
I
don't
hate
you
‘cause,
Ma
You're
still
beautiful
to
me,
‘cause
you're
my
mom
Though
far
be
it
from
you
to
be
calm
Our
house
was
Vietnam,
Desert
Storm
And
both
of
us
put
together
could
form
an
atomic
bomb
Equivalent
to
chemical
warfare
And
forever
we
could
drag
this
on
and
on
But
agree
to
disagree,
that
gift
for
me
Up
under
the
Christmas
tree
don't
mean
shit
to
me
You're
kickin'
me
out?
It's
15
degrees
And
it's
Christmas
Eve,
"Little
prick,
just
leave!"
Ma,
let
me
grab
my
fucking
coat!
Anything
to
have
each
other's
goats
Why
we
always
at
each
other's
throats?
Especially
when
Dad,
he
fucked
us
both
We're
in
the
same
fuckin'
boat
You'd
think
that'd
make
us
close
(Nope)
Further
away
it
drove
us,
but
together,
headlights
shine
And
a
car
full
of
belongings,
still
got
a
ways
to
go
Back
to
grandma's
house,
it's
straight
up
the
road
And
I
was
the
man
of
the
house,
the
oldest
So
my
shoulders
carried
the
weight
of
the
load
Then
Nate
got
taken
away
by
the
state
at
eight
years
old
And
that's
when
I
realized
you
were
sick
And
it
wasn't
fixable
or
changeable
And
to
this
day
we
remain
estranged,
and
I
hate
it
though,
but—
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night,
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
‘Cause
to
this
day
we
remain
estranged,
and
I
hate
it
though
‘Cause
you
ain't
even
get
to
witness
your
grandbabies
grow
But
I'm
sorry,
Momma,
for
"Cleanin'
Out
My
Closet"
At
the
time
I
was
angry,
rightfully?
Maybe
so
Never
meant
that
far
to
take
it
though
‘Cause
now
I
know
it's
not
your
fault,
and
I'm
not
makin'
jokes
That
song
I
no
longer
play
at
shows
And
I
cringe
every
time
it's
on
the
radio
And
I
think
of
Nathan
being
placed
in
a
home
And
all
the
medicine
you
fed
us
and
How
I
just
wanted
you
to
taste
your
own
But
now
the
medication's
takin'
over
And
your
mental
state's
deterioratin'
slow
And
I'm
way
too
old
to
cry,
the
shit
is
painful
though
But,
Ma,
I
forgive
you,
so
does
Nathan,
yo
All
you
did,
all
you
said,
you
did
your
best
to
raise
us
both
Foster
care,
that
cross
you
bear,
few
may
be
as
heavy
as
yours
But
I
love
you,
Debbie
Mathers
Oh,
what
a
tangled
web
we
have
‘cause
One
thing
I
never
asked
was
Where
the
fuck
my
deadbeat
dad
was
Fuck
it,
I
guess
he
had
trouble
keepin'
up
with
every
address
But
I'da
flipped
every
mattress,
every
rock
and
desert
cactus
Owned
a
collection
of
maps
And
followed
my
kids
to
the
edge
of
the
atlas
If
someone
ever
moved
'em
from
me
That
you
coulda
bet
your
asses
If
I
had
to
come
down
the
chimney,
dressed
as
Santa,
kidnap
'em
And
although
one
has
only
met
their
grandma
once
You
pulled
up
in
our
drive
one
night
As
we
were
leavin'
to
get
some
hamburgers
Me,
her
and
Nate,
we
introduced
you,
hugged
you
And
as
you
left
I
had
this
overwhelming
sadness
Come
over
me
as
we
pulled
off
to
go
our
separate
paths
and
I
saw
your
headlights
as
I
looked
back
And
I'm
mad
I
didn't
get
the
chance
to
Thank
you
for
being
my
mom
and
my
dad
So,
Mom,
please
accept
this
as
a
Tribute;
I
wrote
this
on
the
jet,
I
guess
I
had
to
Get
this
off
my
chest,
I
hope
I
get
the
chance
to
Lay
it
'fore
I'm
dead,
the
stewardess
said
to
fasten
My
seatbelt,
I
guess
we're
crashin'
So,
if
I'm
not
dreamin',
I
hope
you
get
this
message
that
I
will
always
love
you
from
afar,
‘cause
you're
my
mom
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night,
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
I
want
a
new
life
(Start
over)
One
without
a
cause
(Clean
slate)
So
I'm
coming
home
tonight
(Yeah)
Well,
no
matter
what
the
cost
And
if
the
plane
goes
down
Or
if
the
crew
can't
wake
me
up
Well,
just
know
that
I'm
alright
I
was
not
afraid
to
die
Oh,
even
if
there's
songs
to
sing
Well,
my
children
will
carry
me
Just
know
that
I'm
alright
I
was
not
afraid
to
die
Because
I
put
my
faith
in
my
little
girls
So
I'll
never
say
goodbye
cruel
world
Just
know
that
I'm
alright
I
am
not
afraid
to
die
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night,
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
I
want
a
new
life
Yeah
Tryna
figure
out
the
difference
But
I
think—think
the
lines
are
starting
to
get
blurred
I'm
in
a
strange
place
I
feel
like
Ma$e
when
he
gave
up
the
game
for
his
faith
I
feel
like
I'm
caged
in
these
chains
and
restraints
Grimmin'
every
stranger
in
the
place
while
I
gaze
into
space
‘Cause
I'm
mentally
rearrangin'
his
face
I
need
a
change
of
pace
‘Cause
the
pace
I'm
workin'
at's
dangerous
There's
nowhere
to
dump
this
anger,
and
thanks
to
this
angst
I
done
quit
chicken
heads
cold
turkey
And
started
slowly
roastin'
'em
‘Cause
that's
where
most
of
my
anger
is
based
Fuck
your
feelings
I
feel
like
I
play
for
the
Saints
I
just
wanna
hurt
you—aim
for
the
skanks
Then
aim
for
all
these
fake
Kanyes,
Jays,
Waynes,
and
the
Drakes
I'm
frustrated
‘cause
ain't
no
more
N'Sync,
now
I'm
all
out
of
whack
I'm
all
out
of
Backstreet
Boys
to
call
out
and
attack
I'm
goin'
all
out
in
this
rap
shit
and
whatever
the
fallout
is,
I'm
strapped
for
battle
Suck
a
duck,
crawl
out
the
back—it's
a
bar
fight
Prepare
your
arsenal
And
beware
of
bar
stools
flyin'
through
the
air
and
bottles
breakin',
mirrors
also
And
I
ain't
stoppin'
'til
the
swear
jar's
full
"You
done
called
every
woman
a
slut
but
you're
forgetting
Sarah,
Marshall"
(Palin)
Oh,
my
bad,
slut!
And
next
time
I
show
up
to
court
I'll
be
naked
and
just
wear
a
law
suit
Judge
be
like,
"That's
sharp
How
much
that
motherfucker
cost
you,
smart-ass?
You're
lucky
I
don't
tear
it
off
you
And
jump
your
bones,
you
sexy
motherfucker!
You're
so
fuckin'
gravy,
Marshall,
I
should
start
callin'
you
'au
jus'
‘Cause
all's
you
do
is
spit
them
lyrics
out
the
wazoo"
Evil
Twin,
take
this
beat
now,
it's
all
you
I
believe
people
can
change
but
only
for
the
worse
I
coulda
changed
the
world
if
it
wasn't
for
this
verse—so
satanic
K-Mart
chains
panic
‘cause
they
can't
even
spin
back
the
curse
words
‘Cause
they're
worse
when
they're
reversed,
motherfucker
Rekcufrehtom!
(Rape
your
mother)—
Tihs!
(Kill
your
parents)
And
these
kids
are
like
parrots
They
run
around
the
house
just
like
terrorists
Screamin',
"Fuck!
Shit!
Fuck!"
Adult
with
a
childish-like
arrogance
Wild
ever
since
the
day
I
came
out,
I
was
like,
"Merits?
Fuck
that!
I'd
rather
be
loud,
and
I
like
swearin'"
From
the
first
album
even
the
gals
were
like,
"Tight
lyrics,
dreamy
eyes!"
But
my
fuckin'
mouth
was
nightmarish
And
from
the
start
of
it
you
felt
like
you
were
part
of
this
and
opposition
felt
the
opposite
Sometimes
I
listen
and
revisit
them
old
albums
often
as
I
can
and
skim
through
all
them
bitches
to
make
sure
I
keep
up
with
my
competition
(Haha)
Hogger
of
beats,
hoarder
of
rhymes
Borderline
genius
who's
bored
of
his
lines
And
that
sort
of
defines
where
I'm
at
and
the
way
I
feel
now
Feel
like
I
might
just
strike
first,
then
ignore
the
replies
There's
darkness
closing
in
(Evil
twin),
there
it
goes
again
(My
evil
twin)
It
controls
my
pen
(My
evil
twin),
but
that
ain't
me,
it's
my
evil
twin
(Then
I
step
out
and
see
my
evil
twin,
he
gives
me
an
evil
grin)
But
he's
just
a
friend
(Evil
twin)
who
pops
up
now
and
again
(Evil
twin)
So
don't
blame
me
(Evil
twin),
blame
him,
it's
my
evil
twin
(Then
I
step
out
and
see
my
evil
twin,
he
gives
me
an
evil
grin)
Welcome
back
to
the
land
of
the
living,
my

You
have
slept
for
quite
some
time
So
who's
left?
Lady

Mess

Nah,
F
with
Christina
I
ain't
fuckin'
with
either
Jessica
neither:
Simpson
or

My
album's
just
sicker

the

Feel
like
I'm
burnin'
to
death,
but
I'm
freezin'
Bedridden
and
destined
never
to
leave
the
Bedroom
ever
again,
like
the
legend
of
Heath-uh-
Ledger
My
suicide
note's
barely
legible;
read

Bottom,
it's

I
never

her
She'll

I
ever

her
Fuck
that
shit,
bitch!
Give
up
my
dick
for

I'll
be
Jerry
Mathers
I
ever
left
it
to
Beaver
Get

off

Golly

Jesus
Ever
since
19946
Dresden
it
was
definitely
in
my
destiny
When
on
the
steps,
I
met
DeShaun
at
Osborn
I'd
never
make
it
to
sophomore
I
just
wanted
to
skip
school
and
rap
Used
to
mop
floors,
flip
burgers,
and
wash
dishes
While
I
wrote
rhymes,
tryna
get
props
for
'em
‘Cause
I
took
book
smarts
and
swapped
for
'em
They
were
sleepin',
I
made
'em
stop
snorin'
Made
'em
break
out
the
popcorn
Now
I've
been
hip
hop
in
its
tip-top
form
Since
N.W.A
was
blarin'
through
my
car
windows
Leanin'
on
the
horn,
screamin',
"Fuck
the
police,"
like
cop
porn
Flipped
rap
on
its
ear
like
I
dropped
corn
Fuck
top
five,
bitch,
I'm
top
four
And
that
includes
Biggie
and
Pac,
whore
And
I
got
an
evil
twin
So
who
the
fuck
you
think
that
third
and
that
fourth
spot's
for?
And
crazy
as
I
am,
I'm
much
tamer
than
him,
and
I'm
nuts
Then
again,
who
the
fuck
wants
a
plain
Eminem?
But
no
one's
insaner
than
Slim,
look
at
that
(evil
grin)
(Evil
twin)
please
come
in;
what
was
your
name
again?
Hi!
Faggot
Look
who's
back
with
a
crab
up
his
ass
like
a
lobster
crawled
up
there
Two
rabbits,
a
koala
bear,
and
a
ball
of
hair
And
you're
all
aware
I
don't
got
it
all
upstairs
Guess
that's
why
I'm
an
addict
and
it's
so
small
up
there
Peace
to
Whitney
Jeez,
just
hit
me
That
I
should
call
the
Looney
Police
to
come
get
me
‘Cause
I'm
so
sick
of
bein'
the
truth
I
wish
someone'd
finally
admit
me
To
a
mental
hospital
with
Britney
Oh,
LMFAO,
no
way,
Jo-
-se
Baez
couldn't
beat
this
rap—O.J.,
no
Hooray,
I'm
off
the
hook
like
Casey
Anthony,
hey
ho
(Hey
ho!)
I
sound
like
I'm
tryna
sing
the
fuckin'
chorus
to
"Hip
Hop
Hooray"
No,
I’m
hollerin',
you
got
bottom-end
like
an
8-0-8
And
I
(base)
whether
we're
fuckin'
off
that
instead
of
your
face
so
Let
your
low-end
raise,
yo
Tango,
what
you
think,
ho?
Slow
dancin'
or
bowling?
You
tryin'
to
hold
hands
with
your
homie?
What,
you
think
I'm
lookin'
for
romance
‘cause
I'm
lonely?
Change
that
tune,
you
ain't
got
a
remote
chance
to
control
me
Ho,
I'm
only
vulnerable
when
I
got
a
boner
Superman
try
to
fuck
me
over,
it
won't
hurt
Don't
try
to
fix
me,
I'm
broke,
so
I
don't
work
So
are
you,
but
you're
broke
‘cause
you
don't
work
But
all
bullshit
aside,
I
hit
a
stride
Still
Shady
inside,
hair
every
bit
as
dyed
As
it
used
to
be
when
I
first
introduced
y'all
to
my
skittish
side
And
blamed
it
on
him
when
they
tried
to
criticize
‘Cause
we
are
the
same
Bitch
Used
to
get
bent,
now
I
represent
to
the
fullest
Pencil
is
full
of
insolent
bullets
I'm
like
a
Doberman
Pinscher,
Pitbull
and
a
Rott'
Mixed
with
a
toxic,
the
plot
begins
to
thicken
I
begin
to
spittin'
like
vintage
Pac
Demented,
demonic,
sinister
Ever
since
the
Doc'
replenished
me
The
day
he
gave
me
that
shot
when
I
was
just
about
to
quit
So
to
not
see
him
with
me
would
be
a
shockin'
image
And
I'm
the
definition
of
what
a
concrete
chin
is
‘Cause
no
matter
how
many
times
you
sock
me
in
it
And
knock
me
to
the
canvas,
even
the
boxin'
critics
Know
that
if
I
get
off
to
a
rocky
start,
I'll
always
have
a
Rocky
finish
Eat
me
broccoli,
spinach,
cocky?
Nope
But
I
hope
I
offended
you
when
I
told
ya
how
dope
I
am
at
This
and
put
emphasis
on
the
"dope"
So
when
names
come
up,
in
that
conversation
of
who's
the
dopest,
better
throw
mine
in
it
And
don't
mind
me,
while
I
remind
you
of
the
flow
You
won't
find
anywhere
When
it
fires
and
I
unload,
my
pen
explodes
'Til
there's
no
rhymes
in
it,
reload
in
no
time
Let
insults
fly
every
60
seconds
that
go
by,
so
you
know
I
meant
it
In
school
I
was
so
shy,
timid
Two
pairs
of
jeans
I'd
alternate,
bummy
clothes,
I
'member
Beggin'
my
mom
for
K-Mart
MacGregors
‘Cause
those
were
new,
St.
Vincent
de
Paul
Those
Pony's
were
used,
and
no
size
fitted
But
kissed
them
old
days,
adiós,
I
did
it
They
said
I
was
a
gimmick
Now
I'm
the
one
that
those
guys
mimic
Now
you
fuckers
don't
wanna
go
startin'
no
argument
‘Cause
you
know
I'll
win
it
Name
a
flow
that's
more
authentic,
and
don't
front
Don't
front,
you
know
I
got
you
open,
kid
Don't

Rest
in
peace
to
Big
Proof
You
was
a
beast,
you
lyrically
mirrored
me
Molded
my
flow
off
of
you,
your
spirit's
flowin'
through
me
I
love
you,
Doody,
without
you
I
feel
so
incomplete
I'm
no
king,
no
need
for
rose
petals
to
be
thrown
at
my
feet
I'm
a
thorn
in
your
side,
get
thrown
into
a
throne
Better
watch
the
fuckin'
tone
that
you
speak
Feel
like
I'm
in
the
zone,
I'm
in
a
whole
different
league
On
my
motherfuckin'
own,
it's
just
me
No
opponents
can
compete
And
I've
never
been
known
to
retreat
From
beef,
be
beat,
follow
trends
or
wallow
in
defeat
I'm
still
hungry
as
fuck,
but
can't
even
say
"Bon
appétit!"
‘Cause
I
don't
know
what
to
eat
Fuckin'
microphone
or
the
beat
Bitch,
nobody's
mind
works
like
mine
It's
nose
to
the
grindstone
time,
holmes,
your
mind's
blown
‘Cause
I
rhyme
like
I'm
still
tryna
get
signed
Up
in
the
Ebony
Show-case
With
Denaun
screamin'
"Who
the
fuck
passed
you
the
mic?"
Never
asked
you
like
my
shit
from
the
get
I'd
rather
ask
you
to
wipe
my
ass,
bitch
You
had
you
a
nice
run,
now
take
a
hike
I
ever
meet
my
match,
I'ma
strike
that
bitch
first
‘Cause
on
the
mic
I
gotta
represent
the
real
rappers
The
real
rappers
get
their
mothafuckin'
skills
crackin'
Word
to
Buckshot
and
Dru-Ha,
why
the
fuck
not?
You
don't
like
it?
Suck
a
cock!
Almost
forgot
Before
I
signed
with
the
Doc,
I
almost
signed
with
Duck
Down!
‘Cause
Rawkus
didn't
make
no
offers,
so
mothafuck
Loud
They
jerked
me
around,
so
what's
up
now?
Wow,
how
much
of
an
asshole
would
I
sound
like
Rubbin'
it
in
and
holdin'
some
grudge
now?
But
don't
front
Don't

you

I

Don't

Late
at
night,
used
to
catch
a
buzz,
couldn't
write
Now
I
write
the
type
of
shit
to
make
you
wipe
But
wear
diapers,
‘cause
you
might
leave
a
streak
I'm
on
a
streak,
windshield
wipers
couldn't
wipe
It's
hard
to
decipher
what
cypher
I
might
jump
in
tonight
‘Cause
I'm
hyper
or
somethin'
Needin'
someone
or
somethin'
is
lightin'
This
fire
under
me,
it's
breathin'
new
life
It's
like
I
already
died
once
I
guess
some
people
only
live
twice,
and
it's
funny
My
days
of
being
broke
were
so
long
ago
I
lost
all
concept
of
money
But
you
dimes
won't
get
a
fuckin'
nickle
from
me
Oh
shit,
I'm
down
on
one
knee
I'm
havin'
a
stroke
of
genius—Elizabeth,
I'm
comin'
to
you,
honey
From
boy
to
man
And
still
make
a
whore
moan,
like
a
thyroid
gland
I'm
in
another
category,
man
Don't
group
me
up
with
them
pop
stars
I
never
needed
a
pat
on
the
back
to
get
at
a
boy,
band
No
offense?
Yes
offense
Precedents
has
been
set
that'll
never
get
met
Middle
finger
pressed
against
Moby's
nose
Shouts
to
Obie,
the
curtains
closed
on
my
show
But
never
forget
that
I'm
the
one
you
thought
wouldn't
make
it
You
can't
take
it,
oh
Got
a
whole
generation
of
rappers
comin'
up
That
are
nutty
with
the
flow,
but
convince
me
you've
heard
An
MC
since
me
who's
as
good
with
the
fuckin'
mincing
of
words
Without
mincing
words
that'll
make
you
feel
like
I'm
pinching
a
nerve
Who's
mentally
disturbed
You
might
as
well
stick
a
knife
in
me
and
turn
It'll
be
like
my
skin
bein'
Indian
burned
Hah,
bitch,
there
isn't
one,
when
will
you
learn?
Never
been
served,
if
memory
serves
I'd
battle
that
'til
my
own
recollection
remembers
these
words
You
know
I
got
you
open
kid,
stop
frontin'
You
know
I
got
you

Word
Life...
One
thousand
different
houses
and
Münchausen,
I'ma
make
you
Wanna
punch
out
some-fuckin'-one:
"Ouch!
What
the
fuck
you
hit
me
for?!"
Screamed
life
as
I
punch
counter,
in
bunches
out
of
anger
I
once
encountered
a
stranger
in
a
dumb
gown
Black
hoodie
with
a
scythe,
shit,
I
laughed
in
his
face,
spit
Bitch
gave
me
an
extra
life,
like,
"Take
this!
Now
get
your
ass
back
in
that
game,
bitch!
Don't
take
shit
For
granted,
and
don't
take
shit,
give
it!"
Only
bull
you
should
take
is
by
the
horns,
a
mixture
of
Whitey
Ford
And
Mighty

I
everlast,

is
mightier
than
sword
Finish

then
record,
replenish,
keep
writin'

Nothing's
ridin'
on
it
but
your
pride,
that's
all
you're
fightin'
for
So
you
fight,
scratch,
you
claw,
backs
to
wall,
no
one
was
there
to
catch
you
fall
You
pick
yourself
back
up,
you
dust
your
jacket
off
You
grab
your
balls
like
they're
gargantuan
and
ask
yourself
how
fuckin'
bad
you
want
it
Pull
out
your
badge
for
whoopin'
ass
and
flash
it
on
'em
Nobody's
gonna
back
you
in
the
corner,
you're
a
hornet
No
one's
more
ignorant
than
you
fuckin'
four
in
the
mornin'
You're
at
the
laboratory,
stormin'
like
there's
nothin'
that's
more
important
Emcees,
you
better
consider
this
a
formal
warnin',
you're
in
for
it!
Girl,
what
would
you
do
if
I
said
your
body
was
off
the
chain
And
I
told
you
I
smile
every
single
time
I
saw
your
face?
I
ain't
finished,
bitch,
I
meant
"in
half",
oil
the
blades
Nobody
wants
to
play,
they
say
I'm
a
spoiled
lil'
baby,
but—
Nobody

I'm
only
tryna

'Cause

He'll
fuckin'

ya
'Cause
nobody
puts

I'm
only

'Cause

What
goes
through
an
addict's
brain
besides
static
pain
And
Big
Daddy
Kane,
breakbeats
and
words?
An
erratic
train
Of
thought
like
splatter
paint,
scatter
brain
Yeah,
maybe
that
explains
why
you're
back
but
don't
rap
the
same
(Yeah!)
And
you're
lookin'
way
thinner
'cause
your
hunger
got
you
lookin'
like
They
took
away
dinner
(Chicka)
"Sugar
Ray"
Leonard
Wouldn't
sugar-coat
a
fuckin'
booger
though
just
to
wipe
that
bitch
on
a
hooker's
coat
When
you
say
you're
a
(Chicka)
what?
(Chicka)
GOAT
Now
fling
that
bitch
from
your
fingertips,
hope
it
lands
on
Another
rap
singer's
lips
who
can't
think
of
shit
anything
of
wit
That's
interesting
to
spit,
yo,
who's
king
of
this
fuckin'
English
lit?
Let
your
middle
fingers
flip
on
each
hand
while
extendin'
the
shit
How
low
can
you
go?
Lower
than
Chuck
D,
ho
Hear
the
bassiness
in
my
voice?
Rocky's
back,
where
my
Adrian's?
Nobody's
crazy
as
Shady
in
an
eighty
million
mile
radius
I'm
what
Tom
Brady
is
to
the
Patriots
To
rap;
I'm
not
a
man,
I'm
a
weapon
who
just
happened
To
be
a
rapper
who
just
happen
to
be
on
the
crapper
When
it
happened
I
had
an
epiphany
in
the
bathroom
I'd
never
be
the
same
after
now
I'm
back
with
an
appe-
-tite
for
destruction
and
a
fuckin'
recipe
for
disaster
So
let's
eat
'cause
I'm
famished,
every
deed
is
a
dastardly
One,
evilest
bastard,
even
you
askin'
for
me

So
step
inside
a
dimension
demented
side
of
a
mind
that's
like
An
inside
of
an
engine
while
I
multiply
your
undivided
attention
But
be
reminded:
if
I
didn't
mention
I
lose
my
mind
and
my
temper
you'll
be
the
first
one
who
finds
him
offensive
Got
him
climbin'
the
fences,
lost
some
time
to

But
look
up
"rhyme"
in
the
dictio-nary,
I'm
in
the

"Eminem"
is
the
synonym
for
it,
I'm
an

Fuck

Shit

This
wretched
is
what
you
get
when
you

Then

with

I

Girl,
you
give
me
writer's
block,
I'm
at
a
loss
for
words
Uhh,
my
mind's
as
lost
as
yours
I
rack
my
brain
but
still
no
thoughts
emerge
Never
seen
no
ass
as
large
as
yours
How
much
that
cost?
That's
what
I
call
a
Roethlissplurge
You
drive
me
bonkers,
I’m
about
to
get
my
swerve
on
for
sure
Thought
I
was
pimpin'
'til
I
felt
like
Nas,
the
first
Date
'cause
I
think
I
gave
you
power
When
I
gave
you
flowers
in
a
vase
A
box
of
chocolates,
throat
lozengers,
cough
drops
and
Certs
Probably
shoulda
never
let
me
call
that
job
of
yours
To
talk
to
your
boss
and
ask
him
if
you
can
take
off
from
work
Shoulda
been
one
of
the
first
signs
to
cause
alert
Man,
we
jumped
in
too
fast
'Cause
since
then
I
just
can't
be
apart
from
her
'Cause
nobody's
body's
awesomer
I
lust
her
and
she
loves
me
'cause
I'm
popular
But
you
know
this
ain't
love
You
know
this
ain't
love,
oh
no
(Oh
this
ain't
love)
You
know
this
ain't
love
(Oh
this
ain't
love),
oh
no
What
is
it
then?
It's
desperation
(She's
looking
for
Mr.
Right)
(Hey!)
(Wants
me
to
be
that
guy
to
her)
It's
desperation
(I
can't
even
put
up
a
fight)
(Hey!)
('Cause
I
give
in
at
the
sight
of
her)
And
I
here
I
go
again
You
were
obviously
oblivious
to
me
I
swore
I
was
just
invisible
to
you
'Til
I
went
to
the
lengths
I
did
to
meet
you
'Cause
you
played
so
hard
to
get
with
me
from
The
beginning,
now
I'm
in
disbelief,
I
Never
knew
that
this
could
be
such
misery,
ah
'Cause
now
you
see
nothing
but
me
And
I
don't
see
nothing
but
you
And
I'm
about
to
flip
'cause
we
are
–
super
glued
in
We
stuck
to
each
other's
hips
and
we
can't
Do
anything
individually,
which
is
to
cling
on
Scared
to
be
alone,
can't
specifically
describe
it
I
just
can't
seem
to
give
a
reason
That's
definitive,
just
need
ya
Talkin'
about
I
live
and
breathe
ya
And
you
pretend
to
be
as
mentally
and
physically
Addicted
to
me
as
Wiz
Khalifa
is
to
reefer
Don't
wanna
be
without
you
Don't
wanna
be
with
you
neither
Bitch,
put
me
in
a
situation
in
which
it's
both
I
wish
to
seek
'Cause
this
ain't
love
You
know
this
ain't
love,
oh
no
(Oh
this
ain't
love)
You
know
this
ain't
love
(Oh
this
ain't
love),
oh
no
What
is
it
then?
It's
desperation
(She's
looking
for
Mr.
Right)
(Hey!)
(Wants
me
to
be
that
guy
to

It's

(I
can't
even
put
up
a
fight)
(Hey!)
('Cause
I
give
in
at
the
sight
of
her)
And
I
here
I
go
again
Just
want
you
to
myself
Don't
wanna
share
you
with
no
one
else
"What
the
fuck
you
whisperin'
for?
You
get
on
my
nerves,
you
make
me
sick
I
think
our
relationship,
it
seems
to
be
on
the
fritz
I
mean
it's
time
that
we
just
split
and
leave
the
Games
behind,
your
frame
of
mind
ain't
the
same
as
mine
I
think
you
need
to
finish
developing
a
Little
more
mentally
to
get
the
picture."
That's
a
negative,
Alicia,
I
will
never
give
the
keys
up
To
the
crib
ever
again,
no
Visa
Not
even
a
gift
certificate
from
Tiffany's
You
better
have
an
epiphany,
slut
Guess
what?
(What?)
The
lease
up
I'm
just
mad
the
time
it
took
to
discover
You
were
usin'
me
for
loot
like
I
used
you
for
looks
Oh,
thought
you
was
too
good
for
me,
huh?
Yeah,
toots,
used
to
be
my
Carrie
Underwood
I
was
your
lumberjack
But
I
can't
stomach
this,
I'm
leavin'
you,
I'm
not
comin'
back
She
said,
"The
fuck
with
that!
Where's
my
Louisville
Slugger
at?"
She
grabbed
that
fuckin'
bat
And
swung
it
at
my
head,
I
barely
ducked
and
that's
Right
when
she
came
up
with
a
kick
to
the
nuts
twice
Steel
toe,
girl
probably
coulda
put
a
100-yard
field
goal
Through
the
uprights
You
know
this
ain't
love,
oh
no
(Oh
this
ain't
love)
You
know
this
ain't
love
(Oh
this
ain't
love),
oh
no
What
is
it
then?
It's
desperation
(She's
looking
for
Mr.
Right)
(Hey!)
(Wants
me
to
be
that
guy
to
her)
Lord,
it's
desperation
(I
can't
even
put
up
a
fight)
(Hey!)
('Cause
I
give
in
at
the
sight
of
her)
Desperation
(And
I
here
I
go
again)
"What
is
a
nightmare?
The
dictionary
tells
us
it
is
a
terrifying
dream,
a
nightmare."
I
used
to
think
I
had
bad
luck,
but
I
wasn't
superstitious
'Til
one
day
I
grew
suspicious
When
I
stepped
on
a
crack
on
Aunt
Edna's
stoop
And
got
pooped
on
by
a
group
of
stupid
pigeons
Then
we
flew
the
coop
to
Michigan
to
start
anew,
but
ditchin'
Missouri
for
Michigan
didn't
work
So
we
moved
back
to
Missouri
from
Michigan
From
Missouri
back
to
Michigan
Someone,
put
me
out
my
misery,
I
can't
do
this
again
Mom,
please
stick
to
a
decision
Discipline,
last
thing
I
wanna
do
is
listen
She's
like
Lex
Luthor,
bitchin’,
her
rules
are
Krypton-ite
So
the
walls,
I
done
lost
my
power
to
see
through
them
bitches
But
I
run
into
'em,
runnin'
through
the
kitchen
Pretendin'
to
be
blind
Superman,
'cause
I
had
no
supervision
But
I
did
have
a
super
power
though,
I
could
turn
into
Invisible
Kid
Disappear
out
of
sight
like
a
true
magician
And
one
day
Uncle
Ronnie
brought
over
this
new
but
different
Music
into
the
picture,
and
it
became
my
new
religion
"I
remember
it
clearly,
even
today."
Move
back
to
Michigan
again,
to
live
with
my
Grandma
Nan
Always
itchin'
for
somethin'
to
do,
was
flippin'
Through
the
radio
stations
one
day
And
discovered
this
DJ
who
was
mixin'
I
say
it
to
this
day,
if
you
ain't
listened
to
The
Wizard
You
ain't
have
a
fuckin'
clue
what
you
was
missin'
I'd
zone
out
with
my
headphones
All
I
remember
doing's
wishin'
for
shoes
Fuck
them
stupid
Pumas,
bitch!
It's
all
about
them

Made
that
final
manoeuvre
to
8
Mile
and
Hoover
And
somehow
I
saw
my
future
is
in
this
That's
how
I
knew
my
mission
Little
boom
box
boomin',
spittin'
Practicin'
numerous
writtens
When
I'd
sit
in
my
room,
envisionin'
my
dreams
come
to
fruition
I
remember
Proof
would
visit
Couldn't
wait
to
play
him
my
new
shit
He'd
go
cuckoo
ballistic,
go
through
the
roof
for
his
shit
It's
like
we
knew
the
instant
We
touched
a
mic
that
both
of
us
two
existed
To
do
this
shit;
never
quit,
too
persistent
"Carved
an
underground
empire."
Started
a
group
of
misfits,
Proof
had
a
proposition
If
we
all
band
together,
there
ain't
no
stoppin'
this
shit
Come
up
with
aliases,
bipolar
opposites
and
Be
ready
to
come
off
the
top
as
sharp
precision
If
you
got
dissed
at
the
Shop,
'cause
if
they
caught
you
slippin'
They'd
take
your
spot
if
someone
got
to
rippin'
You,
and
you
forgot
your
written
Opportunity
knocks
once,
it
ain't
knockin'
again
It
tried
ding-dong
ditchin'
shit,
I
fuckin'
got
that
bitch
in
A
headlock,
cut
off
its
oxygen,
Slim
Is
not
budgin'
like
cocksuckin'
cinder
blocks
in
the

Now
I
got
a
pot
to
piss
in
Spot
in
that
top
position,
koppin'
over
the

Lookin'

So

To

I'm

in

Don't

Cry

maybe
my
way
that
I
use
words
Is
loose,
but
you
turds
better
be
careful
how
you
choose
yours
'Cause

bruise

And
the
truth

Now
where's

Ooh,

Songs

Since

you

to

To

go
on
Better
back
away
from
the
front
row,
get
launched
Show
you
I'm
bigger
than
Dikembe
Mutumbo
On
the
fuckin'
Jumbotron
I'm
a
juggernaut,
you
do
not
wanna
rumble,
you
bomboclaats
I'll
leave
you
stretched
out
like
a
fuckin'
yawn
So
mow
the
fuckin'
lawn,
your
asses
are
blades
of
grass
And
I'm
fuckin'
up
this
whole
landscape
of
rap
The
G.O.A.T.
just
ate
eight
acres,
an
eighth
of
that
Was
just
to
make
a
path
And
take
it
straight
to
your
favorite
rapper
Oh,
look,
my
notebook
looks
smoke-cooked
Like
the
flow
stood
a
foot
over
the
flame
on
the
stove,
soot
Charred
debris
floatin'
like
Oakwood
Was
burnin',
return
of
the
no
good
and
I
won't
quit
"And
the
next
thing
I
know
Something
came
crawling
up
from
below
Something
that
made
Godzilla
look
like
a
blamed..."
And
I
don't
quit,
won't
change
It's
like
a
Groundhog's
Day
So
crowd
around,
y'all,
'cause
you
may
See
if
I
popped
your
head
I'm
a
monster,
mutt
I'ma
turn
into
a
monster
I'm
a
monster,
mutt
With
my
dick
in
your
mouth
all
day!
"I'm
not
so
sure
I
want
to
know
from
whence
it
came
But
the
white
flesh
creature's
trail
is
easily
followed
There,
before
that
shimmering
veil
of
light,
the
ivory
skin
slug
thing."
I
can
feel
the
heat
risin'
Everything
is
on
fire
Today
is
a
painful
reminder
Of
why
we
can
only
get
brighter
The
further
you
put
it
behind
ya
But
right
now
I'm
on
the
inside
Lookin'
out,
‘cause—
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It’s
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It’s
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
Yesterday
was
the
tornado
warning,
today's
like
the
morning
after
Your
world
is
torn
in
half,
you
wake
in
its
wake
to
start
the
Mourning
process,
and
rebuilding,
you're
still
a
work
in
progress
Today's
a
whole
new
chapter,
it's
like
an
enormous
ass,
uh
Thunderstorm
has
passed
ya,
you
weathered
it
And
poked
its
eye
out
with
the
thorn
bush
that
you
used
to
smell
the
roses
Stopped
to
inhale,
can't
even
tell
your
nose
is
Stuffed,
so
focused
on
the
bright
side
then
you
floor
the
gas
pedal
And
hit
the
corner
faster,
more
assertive,
never
looking
back
May
hit
the
curb,
but
every
day
is
a
new
learning
curve
as
you
Steer
through
life,
sometimes
you
might
not
wanna
swerve,
but
you
have
to
To
avert
a
disaster,
lucky
no
permanent
damage
‘Cause
they
hurt
you
so
bad
it's
like
they
murdered
your
ass
And
threw
dirt
on
your
casket
but
you've
returned
from
the
ashes
And
that
hurt
that
you
have,
you
just
converted
to
gasoline
And
while
you're
burning
the
past
standing
at
inferno
and
chant
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It’s
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It’s
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
You're
so
familiarized
with
what
having
to
swallow
this
pill
is
like
It
happens
all
the
time,
they
take
your
heart
and
steal
your
life
And
it's
as
though
you
feel
you've
died
‘cause
you've
been
killed
inside
But
yet
you're
still
alive,
which
means
you
will
survive
Although
today
you
may
weep
‘cause
you're
weak
And
everything
seems
so
bleak
and
hopeless,
the
light
that
you're
seekin'
It
begins
to
seep
in;
that's
the
only
thing
keepin'
You
from
leapin'
off
the
mothafreakin'
deep
end
And
I'm
pullin'
for
you
to
push
through
this
feeling
And
with
a
little
time
that
should
do
the
healing
and
by
tomorrow
You
may
even
feel
so
good
that
you're
willing
to
forgive
'em
Even
after
all
the
shit
you
been
put
through,
this
feeling
of
resilience
is
building
And
the
flames
are
burning
quick
as
fire
would
through
this
building
You're
sealed
in,
but
you're
fireproof,
flame
retardant,
you
withstood
it
And
as
you
climb
up
to
the
roof,
you're
just
chillin',
you
look
down
‘Cause
you're
so
over
'em
you
could
put
the
heel
of
your
foot
through
the
ceiling
As
time
passes,
things
change
every
day
But
wounds,
wounds
heal,
but
scars
still
remaining
the
same
But
tomorrow,
today's
going
down
in
flames
Throw
the
match,
set
the
past
ablaze
So
feel
the
fire
beneath
your
feet
as
you
barely
even
Perspire
from
the
heat,
exhale
deep
and
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
And
as
you
say
goodbye
to
the
grief
it's
like
watching
the
walls
Melt
in
your
prison
cell,
but
you've
extinguished
this
livin'
hell
Still,
a
little
piece
of
you
dies
as
you
scream—
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It’s
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It’s
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
I
feel
the
burn,
watch
the
smoke
as
I
turn
Rising,
a
phoenix
from
the
flames
I
have
learned
from
fighting
fights
that
weren't
mine
It's
not
with
fists,
but
with
wings
that
I
will
fly
And
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It’s
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It’s
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
I'm
getting
by
with
my
wicked
ways
I'm
loading
up
and
I'm
taking
names
I
wanna
dig
my
way
to
hell
I

I
wanna

my
way

Guess
I
got
a
way
with
words,
I
could
get
away
with
murder
Ever
heard
of
Aspergers'?
It's
a
rare
condition
It's
what
you're
sufferin'
from
when
you
simply
don't
care
if
it's
an
80
degree
day
and
there's
no
frickin'
air
conditionin'
And
you
can't
see
the
bitch’s
hair
is
frizzin'
'Cause
you
got
the
windows
up,
blarin'
the
system
In
your
Chevrolet
Prizm
The
devil
ain't
on
a
level
same
as
him
Picture
someone
who
revels
in
straight
masochism
And
imagine
him
givin'
an
adjective
an
ass-whoopin'
So
bad
they
should
put
his
ass
in
prison
A
word
bully,
I
verbally
abuse
verbs
Like
they
did
somethin'
to
me
personally
Used
to
get
bullied,
so
I'd
cut
class
and
ditch
it
Now
I
bully
rap,
I'm
the
shit,
f*ggot
(Sniff
it!)
Cadillac
from
a
K
Car
My
ass
from
a
hole
in
the
ground,
still
can’t
tell
'em
a-part
Came
straight
out
the
trailer
park
Screamin',
"I'm
proud
to
shop
at
K-Mart,"
and
it
became
art
And
I'm
still
fed
up
and
as
pissed
off
as
they
are
To
this
day
I
still
get
in
fights
with
the
same
broad
At
the
same
Walmart,
arguin'
over
the
same
cart
In
the
middle
of
the
aisle
whilin',
I
don't
give
a
fuck,
I
don't
play
Bitch,
you
think
you
saw
this
basket
first?
You're
ass
backwards
like
motherfuckin'
Bob
and
Silent
Jay
Illest
shit
you
could
think
I
would
say
Mind's
like
a
pile
of
clay
When's
the
last
time
that
you
saw
a
villain
with
a
cape
Ripped
a
gapin'
hole
in
it,
flipped
out
Ripped
down
the
drapes,
tied
'em
around
my
neck
Went
down
the
fire
escape
of
the
Empire
State
Slipped,
fell
straight
down
to
the
ground
Splattered
all
over
the
entire
state
And
straight
to
hell,
got
impaled
by
the
gates
Saw
Satan,
stuck
his
face
in
an
ashtray
While
I
sashayed
around
flames
with
a
match
And
I
gave
him
the
gas
face
And
this
ain't
got
nothin'
to
do
with
a
scale
Or
being
gay,
little
faggot,
but
by
the
way
Thoughts
are
gettin'
darker
by
the
day
I'm
a
combination
of
Skylar
Grey
Tyler
the
Creator,
and
Violent
J
It's
a
fuckin'
miracle
to
be
this
lyrical
Paint
my
face
with
clown
makeup
and
a
smiley
face
I'm
insane,
every
rhyme
I
say
Sons
you
like
an
ultra-violet
ray
I’m
sellin'
hatred,
buffet
style,
all
the
shit
you
can
eat
$11.99,
so
come
on
and
pile
a
plate!
I’m
throwin'
down
the
gauntlet
to
see
what
hell
I
can
raise
With
the
rhyme
I’m
spittin'
while
I’m
shittin'
on
competition
In
the
meantime
it’s
always
mean
time,
I'm
gettin'—
I'm
getting
by
with
my
wicked
ways
I'm
loading
up
and
I'm
taking
names
I
wanna
dig
my
way
to
hell
I
wanna

I'm

I'm

I'm

I
wanna

I
wanna
dig
my
way
to
hell
I’ve
been
a
career
asshole
I
don’t
see
why
these
people
always
got
my
back
I
done
said
so
much
fucked
up
shit
I
was
born
a
mistake,
but
I
was
put
here
not
by
accident
I
had
a
purpose
and
that
purpose
Was
to
beat
a
beat
purplish,
slaughter
tracks
I
done
put
my
two
dimes
and
a
nickel
in
this
shit
I’m
comin'
to
get
that
quarter
back
Like
Ndamukong,
the
drama
can
build
Your
mama
can
ask
me
for
my
autograph
'Cause
that
cougar's
a
MILF
She's
the
oldest
trick
in
the
book,
but
I
sure
would
fall
for
that
You
done
brought
a
bat
to
a
rocket
launcher
fight
When
I
get
on
the
mic
I'ma
snap
Make
you
wish
the
ambulance
that
took
me
to
the
hospital
When
I
overdosed
woulda
caught
a
flat
If
it
makes
you
sick
to
your
stomach
acid
Indigestion,
my
suggestion’s
Kaopectate
If
it
feels
like
I'm
runnin'
away
with
the
game
It's
'cause
I
am,
don't
speculate,
spectate
All
I
got
is
dick
for
days
and
insults
for
decades
But
I
get
by
with
my
wicked
ways
Lady,
you
can
suck
a
dick
'til
your
neck
aches
Cry
'til
you
get
puffy
eyes,
red
faced
But
I'm
leavin'
on
this
jet
plane
You
ain't
fly,
you're
an
airhead
And
I'm
sick
of
poundin'
a
square
peg
in
a
round
hole
Sorry,
another
catchphrase
But
your
baggage
ain't
gon'
fit
in
my
storage
overhead
space
'Cause
it
just
ain't
big
enough
to
fit
your
damaged
goods
Other
words:
don't
try
to
put
your
heart
in
a
headcase
'Cause
baby,
stable
mentally
I
ain't
I
need
my
meds,
I
peed
my
bed
I'm
going
blind,
I
don't
see
my
legs,
I
keep
on
falling
down
No
wonder
you
can't
stand
me,
I
need
my
cane
Someone
help
me,
I
think
my
face
is
melting
If
you
felt
these
migraines
And
see
these
maggots
eat
my
brain
This
G-I-A-N-T
hole
in
my
empty
head
If
you
read
my
mind,
you
can
see
my
pain
And
you'd
see
why
I
be
this
way
Ever
since
I
was
knee-high
playin'
with
G.I.
Joes
Told
these
hoes
shut
their
P-I-E
holes,
now
peep
my
game
'Cause
I'm
'bout
it
'bout
it
Like
a
fuckin'
(fuckin')
echo
(echo)
(Psych)
Psycho

a

I'm

Stab
you
'til
the

goes
–
dull
I'm

inside
your

your

'Cause

Get
on
your
Harley
Davidson
menstrual
cycle
And
ride

I'm

Strike

And

my
shovel!
I'm

And

H-E
double
hockey
sticks,
I

I'm
getting
by
with
my
wicked
ways
I'm
loading

I'm
taking

I

Ohh,

Please

Thank

Shit…
Is
that
a
girl?
I'm
gonna
rock
this
blouse
and
put
a
cock
in
my
mouth
And
get
my
balls
blew
out,
and
get
gay
into
the
A.M
And
lay
with
eighteen
guys
naked
And
let
myself
show,
let
myself
show
Buttfuck
it,
suck
it,
pull
it,
tug
it
Life's
too
short
to
not
stroke
your
bone
So
everybody,
everybody
Circle
jerk,
touch
my
body
Who
is
that?
Where
are
you
going?
Come
back!
Why
does
everyone
always
leave
me?
Hello?
Fuck
you
then!
Blow
it
out
your
ass!
I
told
the
world
one
day
I
would
pay
it
back
Say
it
on
tape,
and
lay
it,
record
it
so
that
one
day
I
could
play
it
back
They
ask
me
am
I
okay,
they
ask
me
if
I'm
happy
Are
they
asking
me
that
because
of
the
shit
that's
been
thrown
at
me
This
is
a
beat
with
no
words
at
first,
it’s
a
blank
painting
Exercising
the
mind,
it’s
brain
strength
training
My
motto
is
live
by
the
bottle
So
why
is
my
supply
low?
Bring
in
a
truckload
with
a
high-low
My
name
is
Chauncey
Billups,
I'm
kind
of
like
a
raunchy
Phillips
Screwdriver,
my
crew's
live
when
you
can't
sleep
and
you're
still
up
I
came
in
this
game
with,
bad
intentions
And
I
ain't
budged,
not
even
an
inch
since
then
Lava
on
my
lips
I
flips,
wake
up
think
I
have
a
cramp
I'm
trying
to
shove
the
lava
lamp
up
my
father's
ass
Got
my
self
esteem
back,
got
my
confidence
up
I'm
gonna
step
up
on
this
stage
now,
I'm
gonna
strut
Shady
man,
I
done
told
you
once
homie
to
easy
up
But
you
just
won’t
listen
will
ya?
Nah,
I
guess
not
Yeah,
yeah,
I
get
it
I
run
this
rap
shit,
now
guess
who's
back
You
thought
I
left
you,
now
why
would
I
do
that?
(1,
2,
3)
They
keep
on
sayin'
the
same
rappers
are
the
best
Jay-Z
and
Kanye
West,
maybe
they're
just
tryna
distract
it
From
the
fact
that
I'm
comin'
back
Or
maybe
it's
'cause
I
ain't
black,
maybe
it's
because
of
that
Maybe
it's
because
I'm
the
highest
sellin'
artist
in
rap
While
I'm
sittin'
back
in
my
office
jackin'
off
to
my
plaques
I'm
still
sick,
how
can
I
be
sick
this
long?
And
I'm
still
alive,
Magic
Johnson
of
rhymes
I
thrive
on
makin'
my
opponents
think
that
I've
died
That's
when
I
just
pop
up
outta
nowhere,
oh
yeah,
there
we
go
there
Damn,
I
forgot
how
much
money
he
got
On
the
beach
of
St.
Tropez,
but
your
man
don't
lay
In
the
sun
'cause
I
don't
tan,
I
burn,
blood
clot
When
you
gonna
learn
how
much
money
we've
earned?
How
does
it
feel
to
know
I
came
in
this
game
at
25
And
coulda
retired
at
29
in
my
20's
still?
And
Fif'
hit
a
lick
on
that
Coca-Cola
shit
He
ain't
even
got
to
look
at
coke
to
even
hold
a
brick
No
more,
oh
boy,
goddamn
did
he
score
To
go
from
sellin'
bags
to
bottles
right
out
the
store
And
Shady
hit
the
box
office
man,
he
knocked
the
socks
off
us
My
ex-wife
is
set
for
life,
you
profitless
cocksuckers
So
stay
the
fuck
off
us,
we
make
pay
I'm
just
a
super
easy
modest
MC,
okay?
'Til
I
hear
the
word
has
been,
that's
when
I
start
spazzin'
Smart
asses,
kiss
a
smarter
ass
then
I'm
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
rap,
bastards
I'm
a
blonde
Dre,
now
gimme
Kanye's
glasses
Obie
the
person
that
came
up
introverted
'Cause
of
nervousness,
that
was
solely
the
only
verdict
It
was
worth
it
'cause
he
changed,
became
so
observant
Servin'
such
of
a
purpose
If
you
knew
him
earlier
in
his
days,
it's
like
a
different
version
So
much
hurtin'
and
pain
gave
him
game
for
certain
That's
why
it's
curtains
in
this
murder,
if
you
get
him
worked
up
I'm
so
assertive
on
these
muthafuckas
acting
tougher
Had
enough
of
isolatin'
myself
in
a
room
Writing
poems
and
songs,
doing
the
same
in
school
Now
look
what
he
became,
a
fool
'Cause
he
learned
how
to
sustain
his
tool
and
obtain
fame
from
you
Livin'
hard
but

Julliard
A
god
walks
and
ain't
spend
a
day
in
the
pew
Regardless
of
this
I
draw
visual,
pictures
when
a
nigga
vents
So
welcome
to
the
art
department
I
stimulate
the
brain,
mimic,
emulate
the
sane
Cynics
keep
on
thinkin'
it's
a
fuckin'
gimmick
when
it
ain't
Clinically
insane,
brain
is
on
Venus,
up
Uranus
Label
me
a
genius
if
you
ever
seen
us
you
would
say
"He
may
seem
as
though
he's
plain
normal"
if
you
ever
meet
him
Greet
him
with
a
shake,
see
he
ain't
as
mean
as
what
they
say
See
the
thing
is
maybe
he
can't
always
think
of
things
to
say
So
he's
vague,
so
they
mistake
him
for
bein'
crazed
You
part
ways,
your
impression
of
him
changed
You
don't
think
he's
strange,
you
turn
around
and
tell
him;
"Peace
and
thanks"
You
catch
him
flippin'
you
off,
with
his
pants
down
Hands
around
his
scrotum,
tuckin'
his
fuckin'
penis
between
his
legs

Am
I
a

some

Or
am
I

psychotic?
Or

thought
I’d
be
cooking
with
a
partner
But
she’s
never
here,
and
I
don’t
get
twice
the
credit
for
all
the
work
I
didn't
invent
odd
numbers
Seth
I
know,
but
I’m
over
here
in
my
unit,
every
day,
cooking
my
terrible-tasting
food,
and
then
I
gotta
look
over
at
Evan,
I
mean
look
at
him,
it
looks
like
the
most
fun
I’ve
ever
seen
in
my
entire
life.
And,
I’m
just
saying,
I
wash
and
dry,
I’m
like
a
single
mother.
And,
no
offense
but,
everyone
takes
this
class
to
get
an
A
and
it’s
bullshit,
but
uh
no
offense,
I’m
just
saying.
And
I’m
not
putting
down
your
profession,
but
when
am
I
gonna
need
to
cook
tiramisu?
Am
I
gonna
be
a
chef?
No.
There’s
3
weeks
left
in
school,
give
me
a
freaking
break,
sorry
for
cursing.
OH
MY
GOD
that’s
like
the
coolest
fucking
story
I’ve
ever
heard
in
my
life,
it’s
insane.
Can
you
tell
us
again?
Do
you
have
time?
Tracy,
Tracy,
can
you
hear
me?
I’m
in
the
car
right
now.
Listen,
I
am
McLovin,
yeah.
McLovin
in
the
house!
McLovin
in
the
house!
Yeah
Ayo,
I
know
it’s
been
a
minute,
but
we're
back
It’s
the
return
of
the
Dozen
motherfuckers,
let's
go!
Fame
I
think
it’s
got
me
goin'
crazy,
oh—oh—oh
I'm
gettin'
lost
in
this
game
I'm
gettin'
tired
of
all
you
naysayers,
whoa—oh—oh
Keep
speakin'
my
name
And
then
we'll
have
reason
to
hate
me,
ye—eh—eah
It's
like
you
don't
want
me
to
win
So
this
time
I’m
goin'
in
This
the
life
of
a
rocker,
Jägermeister
and
vodka
Hopping
off
of
the
club's
balcony
into
the
crowd,
surfing
And
when
they
drop
me
I’m
randomly
socking
fans
Doin'
my
interviews
in
hockey
masks,
slapped
a
journalist
on
her
ass
I’m
high
off
speed,
driving
my
car
at
high
speed
Pocket
full
of
weed
while
lesbians
swallow
E
I'm
in
the
studio
ign'ant,
my
engineer
gon’
call
police
I
feel
asleep
on
the
sound
board,
ain't
did
a
song
for
weeks
(What?)
LSD
be
all
up
in
my
head,
giving
thanks
for
Grateful
Dead
Bussing
in
the
air
with
30
bitches
up
in
my
bed
I’m
kickin’
'em
out
naked
and
it's
December
Niggas
ask
me
why
I
did
it,
but
fuck
it,
I
can’t
remember
Fame
I
think
it’s
got
me
goin'
crazy,
oh—oh—oh
I'm
gettin'
lost
in
this
game
I'm
gettin'
tired
of
all
you
naysayers,
whoa—oh—oh
Keep
speakin'
my
name
And
then
we'll
have
reason
to
hate
me,
ye—eh—eah
It's
like
you
don't
want
me
to
win
So
this
time
I’m
goin'
in
Them
boys
are
wylin’,
drinkin’,
cussin’
and
hyper
smilin’
Been
ridin’
for
days,
tour
bus
look
like
Rikers
Island
Henny,
Jack
Daniels,
spray
paintin'
a
die
hard
fan
Little
Cocker
Spaniel
fresh
outta
the
damn
zoo
Man,
you
better
be
cautious,
I’m
backstage
Livin'
it
up
with
a
couple
of
sluts
feeling
nauseous
From
drinkin',
it’s
been
a
couple
of
days
since
I’ve
slept
My
dick
is
sore
from
fuckin',
when
I
bust
there’s
nothing
left,
just
dust
Back
on
the
stage,
gimme
my
microphone
Scrapping
with
the
audience
while
we
perform
hyper
songs
Our
label
presented
us
with
a
plaque
Brought
it
on
stage
and
bash
it
to
pieces
with
aluminium
bats,
thanks!
Now
which
one
of
you
bitches
down
for
the
cause?
Yeah,
I
said
my
dick
is
sore,
but
I
ain't
say
shit
about
my
balls
(Last
call)
Then
we
off
to
the
next
city
Whatever
I
didn’t
drink
on
my
rider,
bag
it
up
and
take
the
rest
with
me
Fame
I
think
it’s
got
me
goin'
crazy,
oh—oh—oh
I'm
gettin'
lost
in
this
game
I'm
gettin'
tired
of
all
you
naysayers,
whoa—oh—oh
Keep
speakin'
my
name
And
then
we'll
have
reason
to
hate
me,
ye—eh—eah
It's
like
you
don't
want
me
to
win
So
this
time
I’m
goin'
in
Yeah,
this
game
has
got
me
goin'
crazy
Fuck
it,
I
am
crazy,
what's
new?
What
kind
of
fuckin'
glue
you
think
I’d
be
if
I
was
glue?
We
lost
Proof,
he
was
our
group's
glue
but
where
was
you
When
we
were
falling
apart?
You
were
shittin'
on
us
too
But
no
one
but
us
knew
we
were
beefing
'cause
that's
what
happens
When
you
beef
with
crew,
it
stays
in
your
crew
'cause
it's
just
crew
But
we're
back
now,
yeah,
we
took
our
time
but
in
one
crew
Only
thing
we're
in
a
hurry
for
now
is
to
rush
you
And
we're
back
to
say
shit
you
don't
got
the
guts
or
the
nuts
to
Pussy,
go
pick
your
pussy
leaves
off
your
cunt
tree,
fuck
you
Achoo,
bless
you,
I’m
allergic
to
pussy
Sluts
too,
yeah,
you
think
you’re
the
shit
'til
we
flush
you
Had
some
bullshit
to
readjust
to
Now
there's
just
a
few
of
us
left,
but
it’d
be
unjust
to
rob
us
our
just
due
So
rest
in
peace
to
Bugz
and
Proof,
this
one's
for
you
homies,
we
love
you
But
we
can’t
stop
now,
we'd
have
too
much
of
our
blood
drew
from
this...
Fame
I
think
it’s
got
me
goin'
crazy,
oh—oh—oh
I'm
gettin'
lost
in
this
game
I'm
gettin'
tired
of
all
you
naysayers,
whoa—oh—oh
Keep

my

And
then
we'll
have

It's

So
this
time
I’m
goin'
in
It's
the
Return
of
the
Dozen
Volume
Number
Two.
I
go
by
the
name
of
DJ
Young
Mase.
Welcome

McVay,

Let's

"You

You

Got

big
as
a
banana
I
try
to
control
it
but
I
guess
I
can't
It
shoots
off
like
an
AK-clip
banana
You
better
watch
out,
Hannah
Montana
Man,

the
matter,
have
you

manners?
No

Juno's
address
Yeah,

jail
for
that
Now
I
got
the
cops
on
my
tail
for
that
Run

on
your
car
with
a
stale
banana
In
your
tail
pipe,
can't
believe
you
fell
for
that
It
could've
been
a
molotov
cocktail
for
that
Wait
a
minute

the
hell
was

I
heard

What

You

I

a
woman
in
a
Freddy
Kruger
mask
Who

Superman?
All

is

little
stupid
can
Of
whipped
cream,

I'ma

You

steady
She's
probably
back
there
with
a
damn
machete
She's
probably
gonna
eat
you
like
canned
spaghetti
She's
probably
gonna
kill

still
wanna
check,

Have
a

quick

Big

The

we
probably
should
run
Don't
dare
look

Probably,
there
probably
was
a
problem
At
the
post

But

cream

And
when
you

her,
make
sure
you
get
a

We
could
try
to
make
another
Blair
Witch
movie
A

Put

Zack
and
Miri
Beauty
and
the
Beast,
his
back
is
hairy
But

attractive,
very
Very
sexually
active,
very
No,
Zack,

go
back
in
there
It's
too
late

she's
grabbin'

He
screams,
bloody
Mary,
grabs
a
mirror
But
stop
just

in
her
vocabulary
Get
off

please,
get
off

Balling
back
at
a
coffee
shop
They
go
non-stop,
she
says
go
He
says
no,
she
says
oh
Back
and
forth,
they
scream
and
shout
Yeah,
boy,
let
them
demons
out
It's
the
kind
of
nightmare
you
dream
about
Uh-oh,
now
the
whipped
cream
is
out
I
get
sick
thoughts,
sick,
sick,
thoughts
Things
you
could
do
with
your
lipstick
gloss
Put
it
on
my
dick
'til
the
tip
looks
orange
Bitch,

And
I’m
willing
to
borrow
your
grass
But
I
specialize
in
eating
MC's
In
the
immortal
words
of
LL
Cool
J
As
he
would
say:
"I'm
a
G.O.A.T.!"
And
for
those
of
y'all
who
don't
know
what
a
G.O.A.T.
is
It
means
the
Greatest
Of
All
Time
And
I
consider
myself
one
of
those
So
thank
you
very
much,
here
it
goes
This
is
the
part
I
was
worried
about
Everyone
thinks
that
my
career
is
down
the
tubes
And
I'm
in
some
dusty
garage
Inhalin'
them
carbon
monoxide
fumes
And
everyone's
tellin'
me
what
I
should
do
And
how
I
should
come
out
and
what
to
rap
about
And
I
know
I
got
a
lot
up
In
my
medulla
oblongata
that
I
gotta
get
out
And
I'm
not
sure
how
this
is
gonna
come
off
They're
probably
gonna
think
that
I'm
comin'
off
as
cocky
Like
I
just
started
givin'
a
fuck
what
you
really
think
about
me
See,
the
thing
about
me
Is
you
don't
really
know
a
thing
about
me
Everyone's
makin'
a
stink
about
me
Like
there's
some
kind
of
an
aura
of
that
of
the
king
around
me
Surround
me
with
nothin'
but
gangsters
Killers
and
bangers
and
the
most
dangerous
criminals
And
I
feel
like
I'm
more
comfortable
around
them
Than
I
do
my
own
motherfuckin'
neighbors
But
see,
my
dream
is
to
be
remembered
as
one
of
the
best
when
I
leave
But
why
does
it
seem
like
I'm
not
even
put
up
in
the
same
category
as
other
MC's?
So
when
Weezy
says
that
he's
better
than
Jay
Z
Please
be
that
just
subliminally
Means
he
thinks
Jigga's
the
best
And
that
he's
the
only
one
up
in
that
league,
see
And
it's
easy
just
to
consider
me
One
of
the
greatest
white
rappers
there
is
Knowin'
goddamn
well
that
I'm
one
of
the
best
motherfuckin'
rappers
who
ever
lived,
period
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
and
I
don't
mean
to
gloat
But
I
know
what
I
know
and
I
know
what
you
think
And
these
magazines'll
never
put
it
in
ink
Because
how
would
it
look
if
they
considered
me
as
a
G.O.A.T.?
And
for
those
of
y'all
who
don't
know
what
a
G.O.A.T.
is
It
means
the
Greatest
Of
All
Time
And
I
consider
myself
one
of
those
So
thank
you
very
much,
here
it
goes
Maybe
they
figure
that
I'm
on
my
way
out
the
game
So
they
gotta
go
try
to
find
'em
a
new
Eminem
or
a
new
Shady
If
they
think
it's
gonna
happen,
man,
I
thought
I
was
crazy
Or
maybe
I
could
be
takin'
it
wrong
And
they're
tryna
pay
homage
to
me
in
a
strange
way
So
let
me
pay
homage
to
my
fellow
white
competitors
almost
in
the
same
way
See,
you
hardly
ever
do
hear
anyone
even
bringin'
up
that
Paul
Wall's
white
‘Cause
lyrically
he
doesn't
pose
a
threat
to
anyone,
see,
he's
just
aight
And
Bubba
Sparxxx,
he
just
won't
write
Because
he's
so
caught
up
in
that
snow
white
That
Timbaland
can't
even
get
him
in
the
studio
He's
so
gone
off
that
coke,
right?
And
it's
so
sad
‘cause
he's
dope,
right?
America's
next
great
white
hope,
right?
So
now
they
feel
like
they
gotta
come
up
with
some
corny-ass
White
Rapper
Show,
right?
And
which
I'm
still
havin'
mixed
feelings
about
They
said
it'd
be
real,
I'm
just
spillin'
it
out
There's
somethin'
about
a
white
boy
talkin'
black
And
runnin'
around
with
a
damn
grill
in
his
mouth
And
I
love
when
the
say
that
Tiger
Woods
shit
"Isn't
it
ironic
that
the
best
rapper's
white
And
the
best
golfer's
black?"
And
I'm
the
one
who's
gotta
catch
all
the
flack
off
of
that
But
these
are
the
people
who
never
had
heard
of
an
Eminem
until
8
Mile
had
came
out
But
I
had
already
hit
middle
America
Parents
had
all
got
to
likin'
me
now
When
suddenly
I
wasn't
such
a
bad
guy
All
of
the
hatred
for
me
must've
died
Thought
I
committed
career
suicide
So
I
had
to
turn
back
into
the
bad
guy
So
faggoty
faggoty
faggoty
gays
Anatomy
God
made
Raggedy
Ann
and
Andy
Not
Raggedy
Andy
and
Andy
and
Andy
And
Angelina
Jolie
is
just
another
ho
And
Brad
is
a
sucka,
because
once
I
fuck
her
She
wants
to
go
to
Somalia
to
adopt
another
baby
You
know
what
I
say?
—
"No."
You
better
save
some
of
them
kids
from
Madonna
She
needs
all
the
publicity
she
can
get
You
wanted
Shady,
well
you
got
it,
man,
I
ain't
apologizin'
for
shit
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
and
I
don't
mean
to
gloat
But
I
know
what
I
know
and
I
know
what
you
think
And
these
magazines'll
never
put
it
in
ink
Because
how
would
it
look
If
they
considered
me
as
a
G.O.A.T.?
And
for
those
of
y'all
who
don't
know
what
a
G.O.A.T.
is
It
means
the
Greatest
Of
All
Time
And
I
consider
myself
one
of
those
So
thank
you
very
much,
here
it
goes
Man,
I'm
takin'
my
ball
and
goin'
home
Man,
shit
is
too
easy
Nobody
even
wants
to
pass
me
the
ball
‘Cause
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
So
don't
worry,
I'm
out
the
motherfuckin'
game
And
y'all
can
sit
and
argue
about
who's
the
motherfuckin'
best
But
y'all
know
that
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
And
like
I
said,
I'm
one
of
the
motherfuckin'
best
Before
you
get
your
panties
in
a
motherfuckin'
bunch
But
before
I
go,
I'd
like
to
say
fuck
you
very
much
To
everybody
who
wasn't
there
from
the
start
And
thank
you
very
much
to
everybody
who
was
And
y'all
ain't
gotta
say
it,
just
think
it
‘Cause
I
know
that
you
know
that
I
know
That
you
know
that
I
know
that
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
I'm
out
y'all,
it's
been
real—peace!
I'm
a
little
nutty
and
I
know
it
but
if
you
go
back
and
take
a
look
at
my
history
You
will
see
that
I
am
not
the
only
one
who's
off
his
rocker,
there
were
many
before
me
I
was
always
labeled
the
black
sheep
of
the
family,
what
a
bad
seed
I'd
grow
to
be
But
if
you
take
a
look
at
us
now
you'll
see
the
apple
didn't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
Alright
look,
I'mma
tell
you
the
story
from
my
side
Maybe
you'll
understand,
check
it
out
You
done
witnessed
unexplainable
shit
Too
insane
to
explain,
people
run
from
what
they
just
don't
get
Maybe
Shady
should
have
just
hit
'em
with
a
little
bit
Did
I
spit
too
soon?
Should
I
have
spoon
fed
'em
it?
But
I
was
just
so
eager
to
prove
I
was
even
Worth
bein'
in
the
same
league
or
the
room
Of
the
people
of
whom
I
was
in
Every
now
and
then,
I
look
up
like
I
was
seekin'
approval
Was
it
because
of
the
pigment
of
my
skin?
Or
was
it
a
figment
of
my
imagination?
Maybe
it
bothered
me
more
than
it
did
them
Maybe
it
wasn't
a
big
deal
back
then
But
to
me
it
was,
see
what
it
was
Was
I
had
developed
a
complex
from
being
judged
Proof
spit
his
verse,
now
I'm
next,
let's
see
who
balks
I'm
in
the
booth
staring
back
to
see
whose
mugs
I
get
a
reaction
from,
usually
the
first
thumb
Was
from
Proof
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
backed
him
up
And
no
one
lied
to
each
other
'cause
none
of
us
had
deals
It
was
real,
we
just
wanted
tickets
for
that
meal
Sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
I
said
sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
Ever
since
my
mother
was
pregnant
with
a
second
egg
'Cause
she
said
that
I
had
a
baby
sister
Who
fell
outta
the
window,
I
was
too
young
to
remember
Kansas
City
projects,
I
was
like
5-6
And
how
come,
I
remember
Malcolm,
Isaac,
and
Boogy
If
it
was
the
projects
in
Missouri?
'Cause
those
were
my
best
friends
until
Isaac
Took
my
tricycle
and
my
Uncle
Todd
went
to
try
to
go
get
it
back
And
ended
up
gettin'
jumped
and
cut
in
the
gut
With
a
switch
and
70
some
stitches
Which
is,
to
this
day,
why
my
mother
still
tries
to
show
me
Some
old
fake
pictures
Of
a
fictitious
little
sister
who
never
existed
And
this
is
why
part
of
my
life's
so
twisted
But
I
can
never
be
as
sick
as
that
bitch
is
And
by
the
way,
that
bitch
is
one
of
my
relatives
Sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
I
said

I

'Cause

You
probably
have
to
peel
back
layers
upon
layers
of
pain
To
see
why
everything
I
say
is
so
insane
What's
different
about
my
brain
That
separates
me
from
other
players
in
this
game?
On
the
surface
it
may
seem
like
a
scheme
Or
some
sort
of
scam
for
me
to
get
some
damn
sympathy
But
that's
the
last
thing
I
need
Is
for
people
to
walk
around
feelin'
sorry
for
me
And
I
am
not
a
G,
never
claimed
to
be
I
gave
my
vest
to
Cashis,
just
hope
he
don't
need
it
more
than
me
But
we'll
see,
'cause
we
ain't
lookin'
for
beef
But
if
it
comes
our
way,
what
do
we
turn
the
other
cheek?
Come
on
Sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
I
said
sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But

my

'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
Yeah,
and
I'm
the
crazy
one
right?
Whatever,
then
let
me
be
the
crazy
one!
Balalalalalalalalalala
Cuckoo,
cuckoo,

Thanks
it's
been
real
I
love
you
but
I
just
can't
deal
With
the
stress
this
game
is
giving
me...
But
before
I
go
You
know
I
can't
close
the
show
Without
no
closure
So
before
I
leave...
Yeah
I
just
want
to
take
the
time
out
to
basically
say
Rest
In
Peace
to
Deshaun
Holton
That's
my
heart
man
Dr.
Dre
For
giving
me
the
opportunity
Just

even
listen
to
me
To
get
me
to
this
point
I
wanna
thank
Jimmy
Iovine
Interscope,
Aftermath
Everybody

the
whole
Shady

Everybody

Paul
Rosenberg,
Tracy
McNew
You

I

I
couldn't

without

gonna
be
a
beast
when
you
get
out
there

Trust

ears

Trice
Bobby
Creekwater,
and
basically

The
whole
city
of
Detroit
8
mile
road
for
making
what
I

today
Which
basically
goes
back
to
Proof
and
D12
I
love
you
guys
man
Runyon
Ave
for
holding
me
down
when
shit

thick
Oh,

be
complete,
If
I
didn't
Thank
my
mom,
bitch
Haha
Thanks
it's
been
real
I
love
you
but
I
just
can't
deal
With
the
stress
this
game
is
giving
me...
But
before
I
go
You
know
I
can't
close
the
show
Without
no
closure
So
before
I
leave...
Ryan's
a
homicidal
misfit,
I
write
the
solution
of
biophysics
On
the
side
of
a
cliff
in
some
hieroglyphics
This
my
admission
to
having
violent
psychotic
wit
Devour,
polish
it,
politics
By
the
way
I'm
higher
than
the
Eiffel
Tower
tip
I
like
writing,
but
I
will
stick
this
pencil
in
your
ass
Before
I
write
your
shit,
pause,
inhaling
hella
kush
Us
and
Yelawolf
like
a
heavy
foot
gas
pedal
push
Felons,
crooks,
going
door-to-door
Like
we
selling
books,
Dolly
Parton
style,
melons
mushed
Now
my
bitch
a
dancer,
I'm
about
as
sick
as
cancer
If
you
could
swallow
my
style,
you'd
probably
rip
your
pants
up
If
you
could
bottle
my
style
and
sell
it
to
somebody
It
probably
will
smell
like
cologne
made
out
of
bits
of
panther
They
call
me
Anchorman,
I
hold
down
the
ship
Leave
you
niggas
floating
in
water,
then
go
and
drown
a
fish
Fuck,
I'm
fucking
heinous,
I
make
you
fucking
famous
Them
lead
showers
is
coming,
fuck
is
you
saying?
FUCK!
It's
fucking
raining,
SHIT!
There's
lightning,
BITCH!
It's
thundering
cause
I'm
cussing
up
a
storm
if
you
wondering,
SHIT!
SHIT!
You
couldn't
muster
up
enough
thought
To
take
a
dump
during
a
brain
fart,
chump
If
you
want
urine
in
your
face,
all
you
had
to
do
was
say
That
you
wish
you
would've
just
stayed
pissed
off
in
the
first
place
We
came
to
monopolize
the
game,
Illuminati
is
here
Yeah,
human
oddities,
at
odds
with
us,
your
squad's
gotta
be
Cause
we
started
out
cold
in
a
snowball,
we
froze
Soon
as
we
rolled
up
on
these

I

You

You

Well,

you
ain't

sicker
Than
a

Shit,

I'm
Illuminati,
so
fucking
ignorant
Sick
with
a

pen,
so
innocent
But
when
you
win,
they
say
you
a
sin,
but
in
the
end
They
jump
on
the
bandwagon
and
dance
to
the
band
playing
Skinny-ass
pants
sagging,
it's

Give

I'm
getting

for
these

that
I
throw

Same
shows
a
year
ago
would
have
broken
most
of
you
crazies
They
call
me
crazy
cause
I
made
it
Bitch,
you
crazy
cause
you
quit,
look
at
my
clique
lately
You
ain't
fucking
with
Budden,
you
ain't
got
no
choice
with
Royce
You
don't
want
to
see
the
Crooked
I,
well,
listen
to
Ortiz
voice
That
dirt
road
hit
the
8
Mile,
the
point
oh
boys
And
if
Marshall
want
me
to
clap,
then,
homie,
I
deploy
game
over
Yo,
I
don't
think
they
heard
you,
tell
'em
again
Game
over!
I'm
a
little
nutty
and
I
know
it
but
if
you
go
back
and
take
a
look
at
my
history
You
will
see
that
I
am
not
the
only
one
who's
off
his
rocker,
there
were
many
before
me
I
was
always
labeled
the
black
sheep
of
the
family,
what
a
bad
seed
I'd
grow
to
be
But
if
you
take
a
look
at
us
now
you'll
see
the
apple
didn't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
Alright
look,
I'mma
tell
you
the
story
from
my
side
Maybe
you'll
understand,
check
it
out
You
done
witnessed
unexplainable
shit
Too
insane
to
explain,
people
run
from
what
they
just
don't
get
Maybe
Shady
should
have
just
hit
'em
with
a
little
bit
Did
I
spit
too
soon?
Should
I
have
spoon
fed
'em
it?
But
I
was
just
so
eager
to
prove
I
was
even
Worth
bein'
in
the
same
league
or
the
room
Of
the
people
of
whom
I
was
in
Every
now
and
then,
I
look
up
like
I
was
seekin'
approval
Was
it
because
of
the
pigment
of
my
skin?
Or
was
it
a
figment
of
my
imagination?
Maybe
it
bothered
me
more
than
it
did
them
Maybe
it
wasn't
a
big
deal
back
then
But
to
me
it
was,
see
what
it
was
Was
I
had
developed
a
complex
from
being
judged
Proof
spit
his
verse,
now
I'm
next,
let's
see
who
balks
I'm
in
the
booth
staring
back
to
see
whose
mugs
I
get
a
reaction
from,
usually
the
first
thumb
Was
from
Proof
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
backed
him
up
And
no
one
lied
to
each
other
'cause
none
of
us
had
deals
It
was
real,
we
just
wanted
tickets
for
that
meal
Sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
I
said
sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
Ever
since
my
mother
was
pregnant
with
a
second
egg
'Cause
she
said
that
I
had
a
baby
sister
Who
fell
outta
the
window,
I
was
too
young
to
remember
Kansas
City
projects,
I
was
like
5-6
And
how
come,
I
remember
Malcolm,
Isaac,
and
Boogy
If
it
was
the
projects
in
Missouri?
'Cause
those
were
my
best
friends
until
Isaac
Took
my
tricycle
and
my
Uncle
Todd
went
to
try
to
go
get
it
back
And
ended
up
gettin'
jumped
and
cut
in
the
gut
With
a
switch
and
70
some
stitches
Which
is,
to
this
day,
why
my
mother
still
tries
to
show
me
Some
old
fake
pictures
Of
a
fictitious
little
sister
who
never
existed
And
this
is
why
part
of
my
life's
so
twisted
But
I
can
never
be
as
sick
as
that
bitch
is
And
by
the
way,
that
bitch
is
one
of
my
relatives
Sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too

You
probably
have
to
peel
back
layers
upon
layers
of
pain
To
see
why
everything
I
say
is
so
insane
What's
different
about
my
brain
That
separates
me
from
other
players
in
this
game?
On
the
surface
it
may
seem
like
a
scheme
Or
some
sort
of
scam
for
me
to
get
some
damn
sympathy
But
that's
the
last
thing
I
need
Is
for
people
to
walk
around
feelin'
sorry
for
me
And
I
am
not
a
G,
never
claimed
to
be
I
gave
my
vest
to
Cashis,
just
hope
he
don't
need
it
more
than
me
But
we'll
see,
'cause
we
ain't
lookin'
for
beef
But
if
it
comes
our
way,
what
do
we
turn
the
other
cheek?
Come
on
Sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take

Yeah,
and
I'm

one
right?
Whatever,
then
let
me
be
the
crazy
one!

There’s
no
need
to

shit,
you
already
know
The
question
is
just
how
far
will
this
go?
How
far
will
he
take
it?
And
when
will
he
stop?
Shady

Holy

"Yo,

And

we’re
gonna
see,

Who

fantasy,
I
don’t

to
damage
your
ego
You
faggots

I
shove

Vaseline
up
inside
your
asshole
And

Couple

tobacco,
smoke

then
go

This
is
what
happens

Tabasco

go
Not
till
Jessica
Simpson
lets
go
of
the
tuna
casserole
I
used
to
love
her
hooters
now
Carmen
Elektra's
cuter
Strap
an
extension
cord
to
her
arm
and
electrocute
her
I’m
off
my
fucking
meds,
but
I’m
on
an
electric
scooter
I
might
just
scoot
by
and
shoot
my
mom
in
the
neck
with
rugers
Spit
in
Jason's
face
while
I
vomit
on
Freddy
Kruegar
They
can’t
even
get
Jeffrey
Dahmer
to
pet
the
cougar
Now
I’m
gone
get
the
rectal
thermometer,
get
the
lubra-
Cation
and
get
the
patient
some
Darvocet
to
chew
cause...
There’s
no
need
to
say
shit
you
already
know
The
question
is
just
how
far
will
this
go
How
far
will
he
take
it?
And
when
will
he
stop?
B.o.B
I
done
told
you
once
homie
to
easy
up,
jeez
There’s
no
need
to
say
shit
you
already
know
The
question
is
just
how
far
will
this
go
Cause
I
will
never
lay
down
And
I
will
never
let
up
I
guess
things
are
gonna
get
much
worse
‘fore
they
get
better
With
the
soul
of
a
Shaman
I'll
eat
a
beat
then
vomit
Like
a
bulimic
woman
with
an
uneasy
stomach
I
pass
by
people
on
the
street
they
seem
like
sheep
and
zombies
Stiffer
than
a
therapeutic
pair
of
jeans
you
run
in
So
can
you
hear
me
coming
Eminem
this
beat
is
absolutely
disgusting
It’s
probably
got
diseases
on
it
I’m
just
being
honest,
I
can
see
the
comments
I
can
see
the
evolution
as
we
creep
up
on
it
I
put
that
music
in
your
veins
like
a
needle
junkie
Shit
I
just
do
this
for
the
haters,
I
don't
need
the
money
I'm
diarrhea
on
the
track
so
it
needs
plunging
Somebody
please
tell
these
girls
to
release
my
undies
Nobody
really
understands
my
language
I
find
it
complicated
just
to
hold
a
conversation
But
still
I
got
a
whole
lot
of
patience
Sittin’
back
watching
Earth
from
my
Space
station
There’s
no
need
to
say
shit,
you
already
know
The
question
is
just
how
far
will
this
go?
How
far
will
he
take
it?
And
when
will
he
stop?
Shady
man,
I
done
told
you
once
homie
to
ease
up
But
you
just
won’t
listen
will
ya?
Nah,
I
guess
not
You
just
can’t
can
ya?
Man,
I
can’t
stand
ya
You’re
rotten,
what
you
plottin’
for
us?
Man,
when
are
you
gonna
let
up?
I
guess
things
are
gonna
get
much
worse
‘fore
they
get
better
Oh
my
gosh
I
put
Natasha
Bedingfield
in
a
washer
Watch
it
go
from
rinse
to
spin
cycle
It's
like
I
got
ya
hypnotized
and
I
forgot
ya
My
God,
ya
psychologically
fucked
Michael
would
like
an
apology,
what?
Tell
that
psycho
to
stick
a
Tyco
truck
and
a
white
tricycle
up
his
butt
And
glue
the
seat
of
bicycle
to
his
nuts
I’m
as
cold
as
a
muthafucking
icicle
i'm
a
nut
I
ain't
nuttin’
nice,
man
I
like
to
pull
knives
and
I
like
to
cut
The
poster
addict
for
post
traumatic
stress
I
guess
this
is
the
most
dramatic
I’ve
been
in
a
while
This
is
the
closest
that
it's
come
to
the
Marshall
Mathers
I
can
hear
him
start
to
gather
I
don’t
paint
the
portrait
of
the
picture
perfect
Partridge
family
This
ain't
your
orphan
Annie,
no
this
is
more
uncanny
Kick
down
Dakota
Fanning's
front
door
while
the
whore
is
tanning
("He
can’t
say
whore"),
of
course
he
can,
man
he
just
saw
her
fanny
Then
murdered
her
while
he
danced
around
the
room
and
wore
her
panties
There’s
no
need
to
say
shit,
you
already
know
The
question
is
just
how
far
will
this
go?
How
far
will
he
take
it?
And
when
will
he
stop?
Shady
man,
I
done
told
you
once
homie
to
ease
up
But
you
just
won’t
listen
will
ya?
Nah,
I
guess
not
You
just
can’t
can
ya?
Man,
I
can’t
stand
ya
You’re
rotten,
what
you
plottin’
for
us?
Man,
when
are
you
gonna
let
up?
I
guess
things
are
gonna
get
much
worse
‘fore
they
get
better
Ayo,
I
know
it’s
been
a
minute,
but
we're
back
It’s
the
return
of
the
Dozen
motherfuckers,
let's
go!
Fame
I
think
it’s
got
me
goin'
crazy,
oh—oh—oh
I'm
gettin'
lost
in
this
game
I'm
gettin'
tired
of
all
you
naysayers,
whoa—oh—oh
Keep
speakin'
my
name
And
then
we'll
have
reason
to
hate
me,
ye—eh—eah
It's
like
you
don't
want
me
to
win
So
this
time
I’m
goin'
in
This
the
life
of
a
rocker,
Jägermeister
and
vodka
Hopping
off
of
the
club's
balcony
into
the
crowd,
surfing
And
when
they
drop
me
I’m
randomly
socking
fans
Doin'
my
interviews
in
hockey
masks,
slapped
a
journalist
on
her
ass
I’m
high
off
speed,
driving
my
car
at
high
speed
Pocket
full
of
weed
while
lesbians
swallow
E
I'm
in
the
studio
ign'ant,
my
engineer
gon’
call
police
I
feel
asleep
on
the
sound
board,
ain't
did
a
song
for
weeks
(What?)
LSD
be
all
up
in
my
head,
giving
thanks
for
Grateful
Dead
Bussing
in
the
air
with
30
bitches
up
in
my
bed
I’m
kickin’
'em
out
naked
and
it's
December
Niggas
ask
me
why
I
did
it,
but
fuck
it,
I
can’t
remember
Fame
I
think
it’s
got
me
goin'
crazy,
oh—oh—oh
I'm
gettin'
lost
in
this
game
I'm
gettin'
tired
of
all
you
naysayers,
whoa—oh—oh
Keep
speakin'
my
name
And
then
we'll
have
reason
to
hate
me,
ye—eh—eah
It's
like
you
don't
want
me
to
win
So
this
time
I’m
goin'
in
Them
boys
are
wylin’,
drinkin’,
cussin’
and
hyper
smilin’
Been
ridin’
for
days,
tour
bus
look
like
Rikers
Island
Henny,
Jack
Daniels,
spray
paintin'
a
die
hard
fan
Little
Cocker
Spaniel
fresh
outta
the
damn
zoo
Man,
you
better
be
cautious,
I’m
backstage
Livin'
it
up
with
a
couple
of
sluts
feeling
nauseous
From
drinkin',
it’s
been
a
couple
of
days
since
I’ve
slept
My
dick
is
sore
from
fuckin',
when
I
bust
there’s
nothing
left,
just
dust
Back
on
the
stage,
gimme
my
microphone
Scrapping
with
the
audience
while
we
perform
hyper
songs
Our
label
presented
us
with
a
plaque
Brought
it
on
stage
and
bash
it
to
pieces
with
aluminium
bats,
thanks!
Now
which
one
of
you
bitches
down
for
the
cause?
Yeah,
I
said
my
dick
is
sore,
but
I
ain't
say
shit
about
my
balls
(Last
call)
Then
we
off
to
the
next
city
Whatever
I
didn’t
drink
on
my
rider,
bag
it
up
and
take
the
rest
with
me
Fame
I
think
it’s
got
me
goin'
crazy,
oh—oh—oh
I'm
gettin'
lost
in
this
game
I'm
gettin'
tired
of
all
you
naysayers,
whoa—oh—oh
Keep
speakin'
my
name
And
then
we'll
have
reason
to
hate
me,
ye—eh—eah
It's
like
you
don't
want
me
to
win
So
this
time
I’m
goin'
in
Yeah,
this
game
has
got
me
goin'
crazy
Fuck
it,
I
am
crazy,
what's
new?
What
kind
of
fuckin'
glue
you
think
I’d
be
if
I
was
glue?
We
lost
Proof,
he
was
our
group's
glue
but
where
was
you
When
we
were
falling
apart?
You
were
shittin'
on
us
too
But
no
one
but
us
knew
we
were
beefing
'cause
that's
what
happens
When
you
beef
with
crew,
it
stays
in
your
crew
'cause
it's
just
crew
But
we're
back
now,
yeah,
we
took
our
time
but
in
one
crew
Only
thing
we're
in
a
hurry
for
now
is
to
rush
you
And
we're
back
to
say
shit
you
don't
got
the
guts
or
the
nuts
to
Pussy,
go
pick
your
pussy
leaves
off
your
cunt
tree,
fuck
you
Achoo,
bless
you,
I’m
allergic
to
pussy
Sluts
too,
yeah,
you
think
you’re
the
shit
'til
we
flush
you
Had
some
bullshit
to
readjust
to
Now
there's
just
a
few
of
us
left,
but
it’d
be
unjust
to
rob
us
our
just
due
So
rest
in
peace
to
Bugz
and
Proof,
this
one's
for
you
homies,
we
love
you
But
we
can’t
stop
now,
we'd
have
too
much
of
our
blood
drew
from
this...
Fame
I
think
it’s
got
me
goin'
crazy,
oh—oh—oh
I'm
gettin'
lost
in
this
game
I'm
gettin'
tired
of
all
you
naysayers,
whoa—oh—oh
Keep
speakin'
my
name
And
then
we'll
have
reason
to
hate
me,
ye—eh—eah
It's
like
you
don't
want
me
to
win
So
this
time
I’m
goin'
in
It's
the
Return
of
the
Dozen
Volume
Number
Two.
I
go
by
the
name
of
DJ
Young
Mase.
Welcome
back.
Swifty
McVay,
Kon
Artis,
Kuniva,
Bizarre,
Marshall
Mathers,
Big
Proof
the
mayor
forever,
and
Fuzz
Scoota.
Let's
go!
"You
little
scumbag!
I
got
your
name!
I
got
your
ass!
You
will
not
laugh!
You
will
not
cry!
Now
get
up!
Get
on
your
feet!"
Yeah,
you
got
me
I’m
up
now,
it’s
your
loss
Must
suck
to
be
you
History
is
like
a
quarter-note
delay
It
keeps
repeating
itself,
and
what
else
can
I
say?
You
wondering
why
I
act
this
way
I
never
should've
gave
you
the
time
of
day
Guess
you
know
what
time
it
is
now,
eh?
There
must've
been
a
gust
of
wind
‘Cause
you
change
your
mind
every
time
it
blows
And
you
just
changed
it
a-motherfuckin'-gain
You
just
said
you
just
wanted
some
dick
'fore
I
stuck
it
in
I
wouldn't
have
been
such
a
prick
to
you,
fuckin'
men
You
say
you
don't
trust
'em
Why
do
I
hear
the
sound
of
toilets
flushin'?
Some
shit
is
goin'
down
You
must've
just
not
been
truthful
from
the
start
See
for
me
it’d
be
nothin'
to
say
you
never
had
my
heart
But
I’d
be
lyin'
Fuckin'
see
why
they
call
this
bullshit
a
relationship:
ships
sink
And
you
know
it's
love
as
soon
as
you
fall
in
it
‘cause
shit
stinks
And
it
feels
like
every
time
I
fuckin'
do
I
get
jinxed
Cupid
must
have
put
a
curse
on
me,
six
weeks
Have
went
by
and
we
only
spoke
twice
I’m
sittin'
in
your
driveway,
callin'
you
from
the
car,
suffice
I
think
it's
safe
to
say
you’re
not
at
home
I’m
callin'
your
cell
phone
You
answer
but
I
can
tell
though
that
you're
not
alone
How
was
I
to
know?
It
should've
been
time
to
go
a
long
time
ago
I
kept
holdin'
on,
it's
comical
When
I
think
back
now
why
I
couldn't
get
the
hint
And
feel
the
draft
you
were
throwin',
I
wasn't
catchin'
your
drift
But
there's
a
cold
breeze
blowin'
over
me,
I'm
over
you
Success
is
the
best
revenge
to
pay
you
back
And
that
payment
is
overdue
I
overcame
odds
to
get
even
The
sober
me
is
shittin'
all
over
the
un-sober
you
And
I
hope
they
play
this
in
every
club
that
you're
goin'
to
I’m
hauntin'
you,
bitch,
everywhere
you
turn
I'm
followin'
you
‘Cause
I
loved
you
with
every
ounce
of
me,
you
know
it's
true
It's
killin'
you
now,
yeah,
I
hope
the
ho
dies
slow
in
you
It's
‘cause
of
you
now
I
don’t
trust
‘em
at
all,
fuck
'em!
Middle
finger
up,
I’m
gon'
just
keep
grabbin'
my
balls,
cup
'em
I’ll
never
fall
again,
I
trip
on
stairs,
I
fall
up
'em
So,
buttercup,
don't
try
to
come
back
knockin'
on
my
door
all
dolled
up
‘Cause
I’m
movin'
on,
don’t
worry
about
me
‘Cause
I’m
gon'
be
just
fine
without
you,
you’ll
see
There
ain't
no
one
on
this
Earth
right
now
I’d
much
rather

I
said
if
you
could
be
where
I’m
at
(bye,
bye)
You’d
wanna
be
you
too
(I'ma
be
good
without
you)
If
you
felt
the
way
I
feel,
I
bet
you’d
be
in
as
good
a
mood
as
I

But
you
don’t
‘cause
you
just
feel

Uh,
I’ve
had
it
for
the
last
time
Your
actions
got
me
hot
as
my
last
rhyme
Your
options
are
leave
or
put
out,
granted,
your
ass
fine
Fine
just
ain't

Drama
is
what
you’re
in
love
with
You
and
them
bitches
you
run
with
Lately
I’m
feelin'
smothered
You
snooped
around
for
dirt
to
be
uncovered
Conceited
with
cover
girl
motives,
I
gotta
rise
above
it
You
thinkin'
about
who's
lovin'
me,
I’m
thinkin'
about
who
doesn’t
Doesn’t
really
matter
what
you
say,
sickness
in
my
stomach
Told
you
I
was
gon'
be
splittin',
you
don’t
think
I
mean
it?
Left
you
with
everything
I
got,
fuck
you!
Ain’t
no
secret
No
apologies,
you
keep
it
Now
that
I’m
doin'
my
thing
and
you
peep
it
The
badder
times
all
outweigh
the
recent
Your
energy,
who
needs
it?
Every
rumor
you
hear,
you
go
believe
it
Point
out
the
times
you’ve
seen
it
You
stabbed
me,
should
have
leaned
it
Revenge
is
mine,
I
need
it,
need
a
way
out
It’s
my
fuckin'
life,
let
her
find
a
way
to
stay
out
Bet
you
thought
I’d
break,
it
ain't
that
easy
Bet
you
thought
I'd
need
you
a
million
times
before
you
need
me
Leave
me
everything
that
I
gave
to
you
Ain't
no
freebies,
get
your
coat
and
go
The
female
Pinocchio,
money-hungry
hopeless
ho
You
fuckin'
with
my
focus
so
Go
back
to
that
chump
that
played
the
role
befo'
Love
is
like
a
cancer
when
you
don’t
let
go
I’ma
blow
fo'
sho'
Unnecessary
weight
makes
the
boat
go
slow
I
don’t
need
you
sinkin'
us,
hope
you
float
Lyin'
through
my
teeth,
I
hope
you
don’t
(Drown,
drown!)
Not
a
sound
out
her
be
dope
Bottles
pop
out
while
he
smoke
Hate
we
met,
proud
that
we
broke
Let
them
girls
crowdin'
me
go
If
they
got
somethin'
to

let
'em
show
me
I
don't
love
'em,
never
lonely,
never

You

Tire

No

‘Cause
I’m

don’t
worry
about
me
‘Cause
I’m

be
aight
without
you,
you’ll
see
There
ain't
no
one

this
Earth

I’d

‘Cause,

My
name
is
Chauncey
Billups,
I'm
kind
of
like
a
raunchy
Phillips
Screwdriver,
my
crew's
liver
when
you
can't
sleep
and
you're
still
up
I
get
the
ball
and
I'm
like
Rip,
you
can't
get
a
grip
You
probably
got
stripped,
you
wanna
rumble,
no
reason
to
trip
I
grab
her
like
Gnarls
Barkley
holds
the
mic,
your
snarls
spark
me
I
smile
like
Charles
Barkley
come
on
I'm
hard,
guard
me
Ain’t
booin’,
ain’t
pursuin’,
no
lawsuits,
I
ain’t
suin’
I
know
what
I’m
doin’,
give
me
the
ball
and
your
life
is
ruined
I'm
like
Rasheed,
I
remind
me
the
spirit
of
Proof
I'm
happy
and
lucky,
ballin'
and
groovin',
I'm
on
the
move
I'm
smooth
with
it,
give
me
the
ball,
you
don't
know
what
to
do
with
it
Shoot
it
in
the
basket,
you
other
teams
need
a
casket
LeBron
sayin'
don't
respond,
there's
no
back
and
forth
This
game
is
mental,
man,
I
play
aloud
and
walk
away
just
to
hush
the
crowd
You
trying
to
touch?
Sit
down
Detroit
basketball
Homie
like
I
told
you
this
is
Detroit
basketball
Man
I
don't
think
you
ready
for
the
I
get
the
crowd
rolled
up
Like
a
U-Haul
truck
Just
call
me
2
Ball
Chuck,
ain't
too
tall
what
I'll
leave
Utah
stuffed
Man
I
love
this
game,
who
the
hell
you
called
up?
You
need
points
on
the
paint,
I'm
the
joints
when
they
stained
All
my
coins
in
the
bank
and
we're
going
all
the
way
Yeah
baby

true,
I'm

to
you
You
already
know
what
to
do
Just
pass
to
me,

just
so

to
be
That
I
adapt
with
this
heat
so
strap
in
your
seat
I
got
a
grasp
on
this
beat,
you
ain't
convinced?
Give
it
to
Tayshaun
Prince,
we
haven't
stayed
calm
since
Leave
the
ball
with
delayed
palm
prints
Detroit
basketball
Homie
like
I
told

Man

Yeah
Ahh
I
said

You

Tell

Detroit

Homie,
hey
yo
Beam
me
up
Scottie
Hahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaa
Oh
no,
what's
happening
to
my
brain?
I
can't
believe
this
is
happening
again!
Lava
on
my
lips
I
flips,
wake
up
think
I
have
a
cramp
I'm
trying
to
shove
the
lava
lamp
up
my
father's
ass
I
think
I'm
out
of
gas,
man,
I
need
another
mask
I'd
ask
my
mother
but
I
think
she's
laughing
at
the
plants
A
half
a
gram
of
graham
crackers
and
some
Van
de
Kamp's
I
think
I'll
eat
some
Ambiens
like
they're
candied
yams
Cut
a
couple
cadavers
up
and
have
a
little
snack
Abra-fucking-cadabra,
motherfucker
look
who's
back
Just
like
a
pendulum,
Satan's
pentagram
swings
I
accidentally
dented
it
and
bent
the
damn
thing
Shit
I
think
I
might
have
did
it
when
I
was
dancing
While
I
was
chopping
one
of
my
legs
off
when
I
pulled
a
hamstring
First
I
Re-Up,
then
I
Relapse
Go
to
rehab
and
I
Detox
after
I
see
Doc
And
I'll
be
back
with
the
sequel,
repeat
the
cycle
Cause
I
react
like
the
She-Hulk
when
I
see
NyQuil
Oh
no!
(Oh
no!)
Here
we
go
again
(again)
Don't
know
(don't
know)
When
it's
going
to
end
Uh,
oh!
(Uh,
oh!)
Where
did
it
begin?
Don't
go
(don't
go)
Maybe
way
back
when
(Relapse!)
Into
the
well,
baby
Jessica
fell,
she
may
have
wetted
herself
Quit
playing,
get
her
some
help
Mary
Kay
Letourneau
sending
me
letters
from
jail
Every
day
in
journals
saying
how,
she
wanted
to
smother
me
in
lettuce
and
mayo
I'm
the
medicine
man,
my
medical
marijuana
Was
prescribed
by
a
doctor,
shove
a
typewriter
up
Perez
Hilton's
ass,
shit,
almost
forgot
that
He's
always
shoving
something
up
his
ass
so
why
not
that?
And
fuck
it
while
I'm
venting
let's
shove
a
vending
machine
Up
his
rear
end
when
he's
bending
over
pretending
that
he
Didn't
say
anything
that
would
be
offending
to
me
Stick
his
head
in
a
blender,
begin
blending
in
G
Where
should
I
put
the
pink
sissy
with
the
fluffy
hair?
Put
him
under
the
stairs?
People
are
already
under
there
Hmm,
I
wonder
where.
Wait,
I
think
the
cubpoard's
bare
Stuff
him
up
in
the
Tupperware
and
shove
him
up
in
there
Oh
no!
(Oh
no!)
Here
we
go
again
(again)
Don't
know
(don't
know)
When
it's
going
to
end
Uh,
oh!
(Uh,
oh!)
Where
did
it
begin?
Don't
go
(don't
go)
Maybe
way
back
when
(Relapse!)
Vicodin's
like
a
nitrogen
hydrogen
vitamin
I
bite
into
five
and
then
I
get
high
as
a
kite
again
I
like
it
when
I
get
in
my
zone
on
the
mic
again
Who
am
I
kidding?
I
couldn't
quit
this
shit
if
my
life
depends
I
relapsed
twice
after
I
came
outta
Brighton
then
Yeah,
rehab's
nice,
I
had
my
name
up
in
lights
again
You
see
that's
why
I
can't
decipher
what
life
I'm
in
I
might
pull
a
knife
on
your
wife
and
slice
her
and
dice
her
then
It
sounds
so
enticing,
isn't
it
nice
when
I'm
hype
again?
On
nights
when
I'm
like
this,
no
time
to
write
just
type
it
in
If
I
could
get
my
pen
to
slow
down,
what'd
I
write
just
then?
Man
I'm
'bout
to
hyperventilate,
I
just
have
hypertension
I
have
the
type
of
mental
state
you
couldn't
comprehend
Unusually
stupid
of
you
for
you
to
think
I'm
your
friend
I
usually
do
what
I
do
and
suffer
no
consequence
I
offer
no
mercy,
the
controversy
is
once
again
Oh
no!
(Oh
no!)
Here
we
go
again
(again)
Don't
know
(don't
know)
When
it's
going
to
end
Uh,
oh!
(Uh,
oh!)
Where
did
it
begin?
Don't
go
(don't
go)
Maybe
way
back
when
(Relapse!)
All
around
The
world
there's
an
echo
As
he
takes
A
bow,
and
they
all
know
All
the
girls,
the
boys
They
chase
the
noise
Through
the
highs
and
through
the
lows
They
will
follow
the
echo
Echo,
echo,
echo
They
will
follow
the
echo
Echo,
echo
It
seems
like
no
matter
what
I
do,
I
just
can't
get
away
from
them
Get
away
from
what?
The
voices
I
can
hear
'em
callin',
callin',
callin',
callin',
callin'
I
eat
rappers,
with
the
rhyme,
consume
'em
The
only
fucking
thing
that
you
consume
is
time,
I'm
super
human
My
world
is
like
a
Rubik's
Cube,
it's
too
complex
girl
You
assuming,
Cupid's
looming,
my
mentality's
caveman
stupid
woman
My
life
is
Truman
Show,
all
I
have
is
music,
ho
I
stopped
chasing
every
chick
under
the
sun
many
moons
ago,
so
pretend
my
dick
is
a
balloon
and
blow
But
you
better
put
a
fork
in
it
if
you
think
I’ma
lay
here
just
spooning,
yo
Oh,
you
think
you
the
shit
'cause
I
just
said
you
was
beautiful?
Diabolical
to
my
last
molecule,
down
to
my
last
hair
follicle
and
cuticle
Rotten
to
the
core
to
the
bone
cold
all
the
way
down
to
my
soul
from
my
head
to
my
toe
Ever
since
I
was
13
I
learned
how
to
sew
and
sewed
shut
my
own
bootyhole
'Cause
I
ain't
took
no
shit
since
I
looked
down
to
my
nuts
and
saw
my
first
pubic
grow
I
told
these
stupid
hoes
when
I
come
back
I’ma
set
this
bitch
on
fire!
And
this
time
I
don't
mean
I'ma
pour
gasoline
on
some
chick
and
light
her
'Cause
this
time
when
I
fuck
this
world
I’ma
put
the
whole
goddamn
dick
inside
her
I
ain't
even
put
my
tip
in
that
hole
yet,
I'ma
go
get
Nickel
and
try
to
rip
it
wider
All
around
The
world
there's
an
echo
As
he
takes
A
bow,
and
they
all
know
All
the
girls,
the
boys
They
chase
the
noise
Through
the
highs
and
through
the
lows
They
will
follow
the
echo
Echo,
echo,
echo
They
will
follow
The
echo,
echo,
echo
Shh!
Did
you
hear
that?
Somebody
just
said
something
Is
anybody
there?
I
can
hear
'em
callin',
callin',

Classical
poems,
battle
my
own
demons,
I
need
a
glass
of
Patron
Bad
as
I
need
a
horn
stabbing
my
clavicle
bone,
I'm
matador
prone
First
time
I
seen
a
desert
eagle
I
was
letting
the
.44
buss,
the
.44
pop
The
first
time
you
seen
one,
you
was
eating
coco
puffs,
looking
at
Robocop
I
am
not
a
man,
I'm
a
logo,
I'm
a
such
thang
In
order
to
clean
my
veins
you
need
Saleen,
I'm
never
referring
to
the
solution,
I’m
talking
about
more
like
the
Mustang
Vroom!
Get
respect
from
the
get-go,
hello!
Step
to
the
echo,
echo,
echo
Pen
got
a
mind
of
its
own,
got
to
write
my
rhymes
with
a
timer
Otherwise
I’ll
probably
vibe
out
to
a
nine
minute
song
As
the
echo
follows
the
Maserati,
as
the
petrol
swallows
I'm
a
thousand
bodies
away
from
a
skeleton,
check
your
Bible
inside
it
It'll
say
this
guy's
an
elephant,
I’m
fly
like
I’m
killing
the
scene
like
I’m
a
villain
with
wings,
I’ll
sleep
when
I’m
6
feet
deep
Right
now
I’m
living
a
dream,
though
we
may
be
reckless
The
ladies
check
us,
they
whisper
Shady
Records,
baby
echo!
All,
around,
the
world,
there's
an
echo
As,
he
takes,
a
bow,
and
they
all
know
All
the
girls,
the
boys,
they
chase
the
noise
Through
the
highs
and
through
the
lows
They
will
follow
the
echo,
echo,
echo,
echo

Got

as
big
as
a
banana
I
try
to
control
it
but
I
guess
I
can't
It
shoots
off
like
an
AK-clip
banana
You

Man,

No

Now

Run

In
your

It
could've
been
a
molotov
cocktail
for

Wait

You

in
a
Freddy
Kruger

Who

Superman?
All

is
a

Of

You

steady
She's
probably
back
there
with
a
damn
machete
She's
probably
gonna
eat
you
like
canned
spaghetti
She's
probably
gonna
kill
you,
still
wanna
check,

Have
a

The

probably
should
run
Don't

Probably,

probably
was

At

you
And
when
you
see
her,
make
sure
you
get

We

Back

they
scream
and
shout
Yeah,

demons

It's
the
kind
of
nightmare
you
dream
about
Uh-oh,
now
the
whipped
cream
is
out
I
get
sick

Some
people
ask
me,
where
I've
been
lately
They
thought
I
fell
off,
nobody
can
save
me
They
play
in
the
background,
I
don't
back
down
So
don't
get
it
twisted
or
try
to
play
me
First
I
come
out,
they
underrate
me
Then
I
come
back,
they
still
try
to
fade
me
They
say
I'm
nasty,
they
say
I'm
crazy
They
ask
what
me
I
think
and
I
say
maybe
I'll
fly
away
And
ain't
nothing
in
the
way
so
I
may
as
well
fly
away
There
ain't
nothing

I

'Cause
I

And
the
only

me's
if
you
looking

And
there's

Got
my
self
esteem
back,
got
my
confidence
up
I'ma
step
up
on
this
stage
now,
I'm
gonna
strut
And
walk
around
with
my
pants
hanging
offa
my
butt
And
you
ain't
'bout
to
tell
me
nothing
boy,
get
off
of
my
nuts
It
goes
one
for
the
money,
two
for
the
show
My
shit
don't
stink,
I
don't
think
so
Wipe
my
ass
with
the
tissue
and
roll
it
back
up
in
the
roll
Are
you
ready
now,
here
we
go,
the
bald
eagle
has
landed
I'm
back
in
your
hair,
sorry
for
leaving
you
stranded
I'm
twice
as
dreaded,
evil
and
rancid
They
can't
sit,
I
don't
think
anybody
understands
it
Especially
when
the
world's
silly
putty
in
your
hands
It's
Play-Doh,
I
ain't
back
to
play,
though
They
say
he
died
in
a
fatal
car
crash,
shows
what
they
know
Shit
if
I
did,
it'd
be
a
trailer
not
a
car
The
white
trash

Homie
you

you're
dipping
your

Inside
your

I
can
carry
rap
till
my
back
hurts
Set
it
down,
go
right
back
to
the
chiropractors
Get
my
back
right
then
I'm
right
back
on
you
bastards
I
was
chasing
the
dragon,
I
don't
know
what
happened
It's
like
the
feeling
I
had
when
I
first
started
rappin'
I
just
couldn't
seem
to
get
back
and
recapture
that
magic
So
I
went
back
to
the
lab,
that's
where
I

Some

I'm

Got

to
cool
me
off
I
told
them
I
would
grow
up
one
day
and
show
them
I'd
be
able
to
choke
clouds
Pick
up
lightning
bolts
and
throw
them
Take
the
world
by
storm
with
these
words
I
form
Georgi-porgi
kissed
the
girls,
make
the
girls
cry
for
it
Make
'em
swarm,
make
'em
fight
over
the
shirts
I've
worn
Swoon
over
my
sweat
towels,
it's
mind
blowing
Yes
I'm
living
the
dream
homie,
can't
nothing
compare
I’m
so
up,
I’m
stuck
in
mid
air,
I’m
loving
it
yeah
It's
like
these
people
are
steps
now,
all
they
do
is
stare
These
haters
are
so
pussy
they
afraid
to
be
scared
This
is
pay
back,
like
I
owe
'em
back
pay
They
spat
in
my
face
now
I'm
back
to
do
them
the
same
exact
way
And
leave
this
rap
game
with
a
bad
taste
And
slap
it
back
out
before
I
step
back
outta
this
crap,
they
Slap
me
now
I'm
slapping
them
back
hey,
fuck
it
We're
slap
happy,
yeah
okay,
now
I'm
talking
some
smack,
aye
And
I
ain't
looking
back,
in
fact,
they
can
stare
at
my
ass
crack
How's
that
for
hind
sight,
what
the
track
say?
Some
people
ask
me,
where
I've
been
lately
They
thought
I
fell
off,
nobody
can
save
me
They
play
in
the
background,
I
don't
back
down
So
don't
get
it
twisted
or
try
to
play
me
First
I
come
out,
they
underrate
me
Then
I
come
back,
they
still
try
to
fade
me
They
say
I'm
nasty,
they
say
I'm
crazy
They
ask
what
me
I
think
and
I
say
maybe
I'll
fly
away
And
ain't
nothing
in
the
way
so
I
may
as
well
fly
away
There
ain't
nothing
else
to
say
so
I
may
as
well
fly
away
I
know
you
wanna
see
me
down
but
we
ain't
gon'
die
today
'Cause
I
done
been
to
the
top
and
there's
nowhere
else
to
go
And
the
only
way
to
see
me's
if
you
looking
up
from
down
below
And
there's
nothing
else
to
say
so
I
may
as
well
fly
away
And
there's
nothing
in
my
way
so
I
may
as
well
fly
away
I'm
on
top
of
this
thing
so
I
may
as
well
fly
away
They
ask
me
am
I
okay,
they
ask
me
if
I'm
happy
Are
they
asking
me
that
because
of
the
shit
that's
been
thrown
at
me?
Or
am
I
just
a
little
snappy
and
they
genuinely
care?
Doody,
most
of
my
life
it's
just
been
me
and
you
there
And
I
continuously
stare
at
pictures
of
you
I
never
got
to
say
I
love
you
as
much
as
I
wanted
to,
but
I
do
Yeah,
I
say
it
now
when
you
can't
hear
me
What
the
fuck
good
does
that
do
me
now?
But
somehow
I
know
you're
near
me
in
presence
Oh,
I
went
and
dropped
some
presents
off
for
Easter
To
them
two
little
beautiful
boys
of
yours
to
try
to
ease
their
Minds
a
little,
and
dog,
you'll
never
believe
this
But
Sharonda
actually
talks
to
me
now—Jesus!
And
everyone
else
is
just
tryin'
to
pick
up
the
pieces
Man,
how
could
you
touch
so
many
fuckin'
lives
and
just
leave
us?
They
say
grievance
has
a
way
of
affectin'
everyone
different
If
it's
true,
how
the
fuck
I'm
s'posed
to
get
over
you?
Difficult
as
it
sounds
Doody,
I
drop
a
tear
in
a
rhyme
The
day
you
find
it
is
the
day
I
stop
missin'
DeShaun
Holton,
it
was
written,
it
was
woven
For
a
soldier
to
leave
so
suddenly,
got
me
wide
open
How
could
God
take
a
soul
so
dope
and
Turn
around,
leave
us
all
heartbroken?
Know
that
you're
sayin',
"Keep
goin'!
Be
a
man!
No
emotion!
It's
your
duty!"
Until
we
meet
again,
Doody
"Doody,"
that's
what
we'd
call
each
other
I
don't
know
where
it
came
from
But
it
just
stuck
with
us,
we
was
always
brothers
Never
thought
about
each
other's
skin
colors
'Til
one
day
we
was
walkin'
up
the
block
in
the
summer
It
was
like
90
degrees,
I
was
catchin'
a
sunburn
Tryin'
to
walk
under
the
trees
just
to
give
me
some
comfort
I'm
moanin',
I
just
wanna
get
home
and
I
look
over
and
your
shirt
is
off
I'm
like,
"You're
gonna
fry,"
you're
like,
"No,
I
won't
I'm
black,
stupid!
And
black
people
they
got
melatonin
In
their
skin—we
don’t
burn,"
meanwhile
my
face
is
glowin'
And
I
feel
like
I'm
on
fire
And
the
entire
time
you're
just
laughin'
at
me
And
snappin'
at
me
with
your
shirt,
bastard
And
I
still
have
to
get
you
back
for
that
shit
And
by
the
way,
them
Playboy
rings
my
mother
stole
from
you
Well,
Nate
finally
got
'em
back,
shit
It
must've
been
at
least
sixteen
years
ago
Well,
I
put
'em
in
your
cask—oww
Movin'
past
it,
it
still
ain't
registered
yet
But
you
can
bet,
your
legacy
they'll
never
forget
The
Motor
City,
Motown,
hip
hop
vet
Hip
Hop
Shop,
dreads,
it
don't
stop
there
Yeah,
as
difficult
as
it
sounds
Doody,
I
drop
a
tear
in
a
rhyme
The
day
you
find
it
is
the
day
I
stop
missin'
DeShaun
Holton,
it
was
written,
it
was
woven
For
a
soldier
to
leave
so
suddenly,
got
me
wide
open
How
could
God
take

and
Turn

Know
that
you're

"Keep

Be
a

No

It's
your
duty!"
Until
we
meet
again,
Doody
And
this
might
sound
a
little
strange
but
I'ma
tell
it
I
found
that
jacket
that
you
left
at
my
wedding
And
I
picked
it
up
to
smell
it
I
wrapped
it
up
in
plastic
until
I
put
it
in
glass
And
hang
up
in
the
hallway
so
I
can
always
look
at
it
And
as
for
all
me
and
D12
we
feel
like
"Fuck
rap!"
It
feels
like
our
general
just
fuckin'
died
in
our
lap
We
shut
off
all
our
pagers,
all
our
cell
numbers
is
changed
Our
two-ways
are
in
the
trash
So
some
cats
will
have
to
find
a
new
way
And
I
know
it
feels
like
the
dreams
will
die
with
you
today
But
the
truth
is
they're
all
still
here
and
you
ain't
Purple
Gang,
you
gotta
keep
pressin'
on
Don't
ever
give
up
the
dream,
dog,
I
got
love
for
you
all
And
Doody,
it's
true
you
brought
people
together
Who
never
woulda
been
in
the
same
room
if
it
wasn't
for
you
You
were
the
peacemaker,
Doody
I
know
sometimes
you
were
moody
But
you
hated
confrontation
and
truly
hated
the
feuding
But
you
was
down
for
yours
whenever
it
came
to
scrappin'
If
it
had
to
happen,
it
had
to
happen
Believe
me,
I
know
you're
the
one
who
taught
me
to
throw
them
'bows
back
on
Dresden
From
eggin'
cars
to
paintballin'
and
gettin'
arrested
To
sittin'
across
from
each
other
in
cells,
laughin'
and
jestin'
They
tried
to
hit
us
for
five
years
for
that,
no
question
I
guess
them
hookers
and
bums
that
we
shot
up
didn't
show
up
for
court,
so
we
got
off
on
a
technicality,
left
sweatin'
Me,
you
and…
what's
his
face?
I
forgot
his
fuckin'
name
Shame
he
even
came
to
your
funeral,
he
betrayed
our
team
And
if
I
see
him
again
I'ma
punch
him
in
the
fuckin'
face
And
that’s
on
Hailie
Jade,
Whitney
Laine
and
Alaina’s
name
I
let
the
pistol
bang
once
just
to
lick
a
shot
In
the
air
for
you
and
pour
some
liquor
out
With
Obie
in
the
parking
lot
of
54
just
before
We
were
supposed
to
get
in
cars
to
come
and
see
you
once
more
Difficult
as
it
sounds
Doody!
Obie
the
person
that
came
up
introverted
'Cause
of
nervousness,
that
was
solely
the
only
verdict
It
was
worth
it
'cause
he
changed,
became
so
observant
Servin'
such
of
a
purpose
If
you
knew
him
earlier
in
his
days,
it's
like
a
different
version
So
much
hurtin'
and
pain
gave
him
game
for
certain
That's
why
it's
curtains
in
this
murder,
if
you
get
him
worked
up
I'm
so
assertive
on
these
muthafuckas
acting
tougher
Had
enough
of
isolatin'
myself
in
a
room
Writing
poems
and
songs,
doing
the
same
in
school
Now
look
what
he
became,
a
fool
'Cause
he
learned
how
to
sustain
his
tool
and
obtain
fame
from
you
Livin'
hard
but
still
Julliard
A
god
walks
and
ain't
spend
a
day
in
the
pew
Regardless
of
this
I
draw
visual,
pictures
when
a
nigga
vents
So
welcome
to
the
art
department
I
stimulate
the
brain,
mimic,
emulate
the
sane
Cynics
keep
on
thinkin'
it's
a
fuckin'
gimmick
when
it
ain't
Clinically
insane,
brain
is
on
Venus,
up
Uranus
Label
me
a
genius
if
you
ever
seen
us
you
would
say
"He
may
seem
as
though
he's
plain
normal"
if
you
ever
meet
him
Greet
him
with
a
shake,
see
he
ain't
as
mean
as
what
they
say
See
the
thing
is
maybe
he
can't
always
think
of
things
to
say
So
he's
vague,
so
they
mistake
him
for
bein'
crazed
You
part
ways,
your
impression
of
him
changed
You
don't
think
he's
strange,
you
turn
around
and
tell
him;
"Peace
and
thanks"
You
catch
him
flippin'
you
off,
with
his
pants
down
Hands
around
his
scrotum,
tuckin'
his
fuckin'
penis
between
his
legs

So
welcome
to
the
art
department
It's
all
psychologic,
why
am
I
so
maniacal?
Am
I
a
psycho
or
some
kind
of
psychotic
shtick?
Or
am
I
truly
psychotic?
Or
my
molecules
just
diabolical?
'Cause
biologically,
I
defy
logic,
by
golly,
haul
me
off
on
a
trolley
Probably
want
a
quack,
or
I'm
back
on
that
whacky
tobacca
I'ma
step
away
from
crack,
Obie
smacked
the
shit
out
of
me
I'm
so
slap
happy,
man,
snap
me
back
to
reality
I'm
a
walkin'
art
gallery,
a
science
museum
Elephantitis
of
the
nuts,
you'd
probably
die
if
you
see
them
I
pull
them
out,
they
hit
the
ground
and
probably
crack
the
cement
I
need
an
ambulance,
I
can't
just
put
them
back
in
my

Looking

All

Stuntin

Hello
Yeah,
Bad
and
Evil
is
(back)
(Don't
stop)
We
'bout
to
get
into
a
tale
of
a
gunner
that
details
the
dungeon
Just
as
the
pale
moon
illuminates
the
hail
and
thunderin'
'01's
the
year
where
I
fell
from
blunderin'
Shady
lifted
his
wing,
then
I
fell
from
under
it
Now
I’m
freefallin’,
my
career
is
gone
into
re-calling
Regardless
of
who’s
fault,
I
was
speedballin'
God
bubble
wrapped
me
and
dropped
me
on
top
of
the
Earth
Then
Marshall
doubled
back
and
got
me
from
on
top
of
the
Hearse
I’m
alive,
nigga,
Justin
T
ain’t
got
nothin'
on
me
'Cause
I
done
cried
Mary
J.
Blige
rivers
I
realized
that
God’s
with
us,
soon
as
I
decided
To
put
that
bottle
down
and
pick
up
my
Todd
Bridges
The
writing's
on
the
wall
Since
niggas
seen
me
at
the
baseball
game
With
Shady
and
Jay-Z,
suddenly
everybody
calls
Like,
"I’m
just
checking
on
you,
dog!"
While
I
throw
up
this
message
on
the
stall
When
them
bottles
stop
poppin’
and
them
dollars
start
stopping
Do
what
you
did
to
get
it
and
don't
stop
(don't
stop)
I
made
a
promise
to
my
momma,
I'mma
out
live
her
How
can
I
be
a
quitter
when
haters
don't
stop?
(don't
stop)
I’m
living
proof,
nigga,
it's
pretty
safe
to
say
God
giveth
and
God
taketh
away
It's
the
Worldwide
American
way,
I’m
living
proof,
nigga
Your
body
language
is
sayin’
your
confidence
is
gone
Well,
pick
ya
ass
up,
lil'
homie,
come
on
You
just
gon'
sit
there
and
take
it
or
make
'em
suck
it?
Tell
'em
where
to
shove
it
straight
up
You
gon'
make
love
to
the
world
or
you
gon'
fuck
it?
The
last
time
that
life
kicked
me
in
the
ass
I
pulled
down
its
pants
and
put
a
foot
up
its
ass
Man,
what
a
catastrophe
it’d
be
for
me
to
be
a
bitch-ass
pussy
And
not
open
a
can
of
whoop-ass,
let
you
piss-ants
whoop
me
Will
be
the
day
I
say
I
ate
poop,
shit,
the
day
that
I
don't
straight
shoot,
I'll
drop
outta
my
anti-women
hate
group
Say
I’m
a
sissy
faggot,
record
it,
play
it
back
And
put
it
on
straight
loop,
you
haters
look
like
you
ate
a
grape
fruit
To
see
me
climbing
back
on
that
wagon,
got
my
swagger
back
I
was
dragging,
hopped
back
on
it,
grab
the
reigns
on
that
bastard
And
came
back
on
'em
without
remorse
man
Man,
of
course,
I’m
a
one-trick
pony
'Cause
I’ll
be
screaming
on
these
whores
'til
I’m
hoarse!
When
them
bottles
stop
poppin’
and
them
dollars
start
stopping
Do
what
you
did
to
get
it
and
don't
stop
(don't
stop)
I
made
a
promise
to
my
momma,
I'mma
out
live
her
How
can
I
be
a
quitter
when
haters
don't
stop?
(don't
stop)
I’m
living
proof,
nigga,
it's
pretty
safe
to
say
God
giveth
and
God
taketh
away
It's
the
Worldwide
American
way,
I’m
living
proof,
nigga
Nah,
I
ain't
fading
yet,
I’d
rather
stay
and
rap
I
might've
made
a
debt
but
I
find
excitement
in
wondering
what
I’ma
write
next
so
I
don't
stay
in
debt
Me
broke,
you
might
as
well
cut
the
embryo
Out
of
my
momma
and
play
catch
With
the
baby
with
AKs
with
baby
bayonets
I’ma
get
rich
or
I’ma
die
trying
That's
why
it's
either
kill
or
be
killed
So
call
me
suicide
homicide
Ryan
There's
a
bomb
inside
my
head,
I’m
a
live
wire
I
am
on
the
edge,
teetering
on
it
like
a
totter,
I
might
Get
on
a
nut
like
a
tire
iron,
I
have
no
desire
stopping
So
why
would
I
drop
and
roll?
That's
how
much
on
fire
I
am
Rappers
are
fun
and
I’m
the
time
'cause
I’m
just
flying
by
‘em
Man,
I’m
laughing
at
‘em
the
entire
time,
why
am
I
up?
'Cause
tribulations
I
have
triumphed,
bitch,
I’m
fired
up
"So
one
time
for
me,
just
let
your
fuckin'
lighters
light
the
sky
up"
When
them
bottles
stop
poppin’
and
them
dollars
start
stopping
Do
what
you
did
to
get
it
and
don't
stop
(don't
stop)
I
made
a
promise
to
my
momma,
I'mma
out

her
How
can
I
be
a
quitter
when
haters
don't
stop?
(don't
stop)
I’m
living
proof,
nigga,
it's
pretty
safe
to
say
God
giveth
and
God
taketh
away
It's
the
Worldwide
American
way,
I’m
living
proof,
nigga
Yeah
Ooh...
This
game
is
like
cocaine
I
want
this
more
than
anything
in
the
world
Haha...
So
do
I...
At
least
I
thought
I
did
Got
to
have
it,
yeah
I
need
it,
I'm
addicted,
yeah
I'm
fading
This
is
a
beat
with
no
words
at
first,
it’s
a
blank
painting
Exercising
the
mind,
it’s
brain
strength
training
It
starts
off
something
like,
"Shady's
an
insane
maniac
Yeah,
Slim
Shady,
that's
a
zany
name,
ain't
it?"
Now
all
you
need's
an
image
to
go
with
the
name,
baby
Wifebeaters
and
white
t-shirts,
Hanes
mainly
It's
a
long
shot,
but
is
it
possible?
There's
a
lane,
maybe
If
not
he's
gon'
have
to
come
and
change
the
whole
game,
ain't
he?
He
wants
the
fame
so
bad
he
can
taste
it,
he
can
see
his
name
up
in
lights
Women
screaming
his
fucking
name,
fainting
Shady
did
it,
he
sold
out
the
whole
dang
stadium
Joe
Shmoe
made
it,
he
took
his
Plain
Jane
lady
And
his
baby
Hailie
out
the
trailer
but
he
ain't
trailing
anymore
He's
ahead
of
the
race
while
maintaining
his
innocence
Little
does
he
know
his
train
is
derailing
And
he's
about
to
be
raped
by
this
game
anally,
now
What
would
you
do
for
a
little
bit?
What
would
you
give
for
a
little
bit
of
that
c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause
once
you
cave
in,
you
don't
want
to
leave)
I
got
to
have
it,
yeah
I
made
it,
I'm
addicted,
yeah
I'm
fading
(Cause
once
you
cave
in,
you
don't
want
to
leave)
You’re
operating
on
all
cylinders,
syllables
spit
like
dillingers
Spilling
your
guts,
people
are
feeling
your
mic
skills
But
these
haters
are
ice
grilling
ya
Willing
to
sacrifice
anything
for
the
life
that
they
might
steal
from
ya
Fake
friends
will
kill
for
ya,
die
for
ya
but
you
can’t
decipher
Why
for
the
life
of
ya,
it
wasn’t
like
this
when
you
were
cyphering
Argue
with
your
wife
again,
she
found
Vicodin
In
your
pants
last
night
again,
your
dispute's
public
Nothing
is
private
anymore,
oh,
and
your
best
friend?
Say
bye-bye
to
him,
what
kind
of
apple
you
take
a
bite
of,
Slim?
(But
this
is
what
you
wanted
Marshall,
ain't
it?)
Fuck
no!
The
way
that
it
turned
out
was
nothin'
like
the
picture
that
I
painted
In
my
head,
sometimes
a
dream
and
making
it's
more
fun
Than
it's
to
actually
make
it,
the
game
stripped
me
naked
It
robbed
me
of
ever
having
another
real
relationship
With
another
girl,
this
world
is
a
fucking
trip
As
I
slip
in
another
world,
proceed,
take
another
hit
Sniff
'til
I
fucking
hurl,
tell
'em
all
to
fucking
sit
And
spin
'til
they
fucking
twirl,
middle
finger
up
again
Relapsing
back
in
this
game,
oh
well,
fuck
it
then,
now
What
would
you
do
for
a
little
bit?
What
would
you
give
for
a
little
bit
of
that
c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause
once
you
cave
in,
you
don't
want
to
leave)
I
got
to
have
it,
yeah
I
made
it,
I'm
addicted,
yeah
I'm
fading
(Cause
once
you
cave
in,
you
don't
want
to
leave)
You
start
off
bright,
just
to
see
your
name
in
lights
Just
so
you
can
live
the
life
You
take
a
bite
and
lose
your
sight,
they
call
this
(fame)
You
think
you're
good,
just
cause
you
got
out
the
hood
Concerned
only
with
getting
dough,
no
longer
poor
But
lost
your
soul,
they
call
it
(fame)
I
hear
it
callin',
my
name
is
callin'
Why
you
struggling
when
you
could
be
ballin'?
My
head
is
saying
yes
but
my
feet
is
stallin'
So
many
walkin'
by
the
end
they
fallin'
But
I
got
to
have
it,
like
Eve
and
the
apple
She
had
to
grab
it,
I
got
to
take
it,
I
got
to
make
it
That's
the
plan
and
I
can't
forsake
it,
yee-yeah
What
would
you
do
for
a
little
bit?
What
would
you
give
for
a
little
bit
of
that
c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause
once
you
cave
in,
you
don't
want
to
leave)
I
got
to
have
it,
yeah
I
made
it,
I'm
addicted,
yeah
I'm
fading
(Cause
once
you
cave
in,
you
don't
want
to
leave)
Guess
I
can't
leave
it
So
I'm
?
Oh
well...
(Fame,
fame)
(Fame)
Yeah,
yeah,
I
get
it
I
run
this
rap
shit,
now
guess
who's
back
You
thought
I
left
you,
now
why
would
I
do
that?
(1,
2,
3)
They
keep
on
sayin'
the
same
rappers
are
the
best
Jay-Z
and
Kanye
West,
maybe
they're
just
tryna
distract
it
From
the
fact
that
I'm
comin'
back
Or
maybe
it's
'cause
I
ain't
black,
maybe
it's
because
of
that
Maybe
it's
because
I'm
the
highest
sellin'
artist
in
rap
While
I'm
sittin'
back
in
my
office
jackin'
off
to
my
plaques
I'm
still
sick,
how
can
I
be
sick
this
long?
And
I'm
still
alive,
Magic
Johnson
of
rhymes
I
thrive
on
makin'
my
opponents
think
that
I've
died
That's
when
I
just
pop
up
outta
nowhere,
oh

Told
him
that

So
I
figured
that
I

Sometimes

Isn't

The

Tracy,
I
joined
this
class
cuz
I
thought
I’d
be
cooking
with
a
partner
But
she’s
never
here,
and
I
don’t
get
twice
the
credit
for
all
the
work
I
didn't
invent
odd
numbers
Seth
I
know,
but
I’m
over
here
in
my
unit,
every
day,
cooking
my
terrible-tasting
food,
and
then
I
gotta
look
over
at
Evan,
I
mean
look
at
him,
it
looks
like
the
most
fun
I’ve
ever
seen
in
my
entire
life.
And,
I’m
just
saying,
I
wash
and
dry,
I’m
like
a
single
mother.
And,
no
offense
but,
everyone
takes
this
class
to
get
an
A
and
it’s
bullshit,
but
uh
no
offense,
I’m
just
saying.
And
I’m
not
putting
down
your
profession,
but
when
am
I
gonna
need
to
cook
tiramisu?
Am
I
gonna
be
a
chef?
No.
There’s
3
weeks
left
in
school,
give
me
a
freaking
break,
sorry
for
cursing.
OH
MY
GOD
that’s
like
the
coolest
fucking
story
I’ve
ever
heard
in
my
life,
it’s
insane.
Can
you
tell
us
again?
Do
you
have
time?
Tracy,
Tracy,
can
you
hear
me?
I’m
in
the
car
right
now.
Listen,
I
am
McLovin,
yeah.
McLovin
in
the
house!
McLovin
in
the
house!
Yeah
There
are
enough
insults
in
my
head
to
fill
up
a
swear
jar
And
have
it
overflowing
So
don't
get
me
going:
don't
dare
start
You'll
never
see
me
again:
Amelia
Earhart
I'm
popping
a
wheelie,
off
to
a
really
unfair
start
I'm
past
grinding,
for
me–
guess
I
just
be
grounded
up
Like
Ground
Round
or
a
pound
of
chuck
Tightly-wound
as
fuck
'till
the
Fire
Marshalls
come
shut
Fire
Marshall,
down
and
up
I
suggest
you
better
shut
the
fuck
up
And
stop
fucking
around
and
duck!
I
ain't
playing
this
time,
I
told
you
I'm
out
for
blood
So
to
say
"I
keep
it
100"
would
probably
sound
redundant
Like
calling
a
bitch
a
ho
or
asking
a
gal
to
suck
And
blow
on
your
dick
cock
Is
she
up
to
screwing?
Down
to
fuck?
It's
a
man's
world
and
I'm
trapped
in
a
land
of
smut
With
a
thousand
sluts
strapped
and
muzzled
Running
through
a
house
of
mutts
In
other
words,
I'm
shutting
every
one
of
you
bitches'
mouths
up
And
I'm
watching
my
language
if
I
tell
you
to
kiss
my
fucking
butt!
And
ain't
shit
changed,
my
shit
still
don't
stink,
player
My
farts
may
have
gotten
staler
ever
since
I
became
a
trailer
park
celebrity
Maybe
my
complexion
became
a
little
paler
Poster
child
for
white
trash
I'm
a
Garbage
Pail
Kid
sailor,
yeah
See
me
I'm
all
up
on
your
bitch
means
I'mma
rape
her
All
I
got
for
these
hoes
is
dick,
duct
tape
and
a
stapler
So
bitch,
you
better
look
for
table
scraps
to
scrape
up
I
don't
subscribe
to
the
News
or
the
Free
Press
But
homie,
I
get
the
paper!
Fuckin'
stupid..
It’s
not
about
lyrics
anymore,
it’s
about
a
hot
beat
and
a
catchy
hook
If
we
gotta
dumb
down
our
style
and
ABC
it
Then
so
be
it
Cause
nowadays
these
kids,
jeez
Don’t
give
a
shit
bout
lyrics
All
they
wanna
hear
is
a
beat
and
thats
it
Long
as
they
can
go
to
the
club
and
get
blitzed
Pick
up
some
chicks
and
get
some
digits
And
the
DJ’s
playing
them
hits
Oh
this
my
jam,
this
my
shit
We
dont
know
a
word
to
a
verse
All
we
know
is
the
chorus
Cause
the
chorus
repeats
the
same
four
words
for
us
And
the
songs
ginormous,
the
whole
formula’s
switched
Cause
we
don’t
know
anymore,
what
are
hits
Is
it
the
beat,
is
it
the
rap
Is
it
a
finger
snap
or
the
same
808
clap
And
how
do
we
adapt
and
get
TRL
votes
When
13
year
olds
control
the
remote
And
Ashley’s
got
a
brand
new
nose
We
gotta
put
some
new
em-phasis
on
our
syllables
If
the
emphasis
on
the
compact
disc
isn’t
the
beat
Than
I’m
gon
feature
EM
and
get
rich
And
let
Dre
mix
the
shit
and
drive
off
in
the
Range
Rove
Cause
everywhere
I
go
they
love
the
bling
bling
flow
Bang
bang
look
at
the
way
my
chain
glow
The
ring
on
my
fing’
cost
ya
man
lot
of
dough,
oh
The
fuck
am
I
busting
my
brain
for?
Its
just
the
way
the
game
go,
oh,
it
takes
two
to
tango
You
call
this
a
lame
flow
You
bought
the
shit
I
guess
you
to
blame
too
I
just
found
the
angle
No
more
reality
flow
I’m
tryna
time
my
album
dropping
with
a
reality
show
Cock
the
Mac
11
in
front
of
Hot
97
And
call
my
publicist
tell
her
“we
in
press
heaven”
No
one
gives
a
shit
except
some
kids
who
just
got
into
sex
on
the
internet
So
you
want
the
chat
room
or
the
house
of
Malibu
Em?
Your
emphasis
is
on
the
wrong
Syllable
They
said
30′s
the
new
20
Funny,
must
mean
40′s
the
new
30
Interesting
cause
ever
since
then
it’s
been
in
a
sense
An
extension
for
veteran
rappers
that
are
better
than
half
Of
the
shit
coming
out
right
now
Its
all
trash
The
torch
is
gonna
burn
out
before
it
gets
passed

So

MC's
In
the
immortal
words
of
LL
Cool
J
As
he
would
say:
"I'm
a
G.O.A.T.!"
And
for
those
of
y'all
who
don't
know
what
a
G.O.A.T.
is
It
means
the
Greatest
Of
All
Time
And
I
consider
myself
one
of
those
So
thank
you
very
much,
here
it
goes
This
is
the
part
I
was
worried
about
Everyone
thinks
that
my
career
is
down
the
tubes
And
I'm
in
some
dusty
garage
Inhalin'
them
carbon
monoxide
fumes
And
everyone's
tellin'
me
what
I
should
do
And
how
I
should
come
out
and
what
to
rap
about
And
I
know
I
got
a
lot
up
In
my
medulla
oblongata
that
I
gotta
get
out
And
I'm
not
sure
how
this
is
gonna
come
off
They're
probably
gonna
think
that
I'm
comin'
off
as
cocky
Like
I
just
started
givin'
a
fuck
what
you
really
think
about
me
See,
the
thing
about
me
Is
you
don't
really
know
a
thing
about
me
Everyone's
makin'
a
stink
about
me
Like
there's
some
kind
of
an
aura
of
that
of
the
king
around
me
Surround
me
with
nothin'
but
gangsters
Killers
and
bangers
and
the
most
dangerous
criminals
And
I
feel
like
I'm
more
comfortable
around
them
Than
I
do
my
own
motherfuckin'
neighbors
But
see,
my
dream
is
to
be
remembered
as
one
of
the
best
when
I
leave
But
why
does
it
seem
like
I'm
not
even
put
up
in
the
same
category
as
other
MC's?
So
when
Weezy
says
that
he's
better
than
Jay
Z
Please
be
that
just
subliminally
Means
he
thinks
Jigga's
the
best
And
that
he's
the
only
one
up
in
that
league,
see
And
it's
easy
just
to
consider
me
One
of
the
greatest
white
rappers
there
is
Knowin'
goddamn
well
that
I'm
one
of
the
best
motherfuckin'
rappers
who
ever
lived,
period
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
and
I
don't
mean
to
gloat
But
I
know
what
I
know
and
I
know
what
you
think
And
these
magazines'll
never
put
it
in
ink
Because
how
would
it
look
if
they
considered
me
as
a
G.O.A.T.?
And
for
those
of
y'all
who
don't
know
what
a
G.O.A.T.
is
It
means
the
Greatest
Of
All
Time
And
I
consider
myself
one
of
those
So
thank
you
very
much,
here
it
goes
Maybe
they
figure
that
I'm
on
my
way
out
the
game
So
they
gotta
go
try
to
find
'em
a
new
Eminem
or
a
new
Shady
If
they
think
it's
gonna
happen,
man,
I
thought
I
was
crazy
Or
maybe
I
could
be
takin'
it
wrong
And
they're
tryna
pay
homage
to
me
in
a
strange
way
So
let
me
pay
homage
to
my
fellow
white
competitors
almost
in
the
same
way
See,
you
hardly
ever
do
hear
anyone
even
bringin'
up
that
Paul
Wall's
white
‘Cause
lyrically
he
doesn't
pose
a
threat
to
anyone,
see,
he's
just
aight
And
Bubba
Sparxxx,
he
just
won't
write
Because
he's
so
caught
up
in
that
snow
white
That
Timbaland
can't
even
get
him
in
the
studio
He's
so
gone
off
that
coke,
right?
And
it's
so
sad
‘cause
he's
dope,
right?
America's
next
great
white
hope,
right?
So
now
they
feel
like
they
gotta
come
up
with
some
corny-ass
White
Rapper
Show,
right?
And
which
I'm
still
havin'
mixed
feelings
about
They
said
it'd
be
real,
I'm
just
spillin'
it
out
There's
somethin'
about
a
white
boy
talkin'
black
And
runnin'
around
with
a
damn
grill
in
his
mouth
And
I
love
when
the
say
that
Tiger
Woods
shit
"Isn't
it
ironic
that
the
best
rapper's
white
And
the
best
golfer's
black?"
And
I'm
the
one
who's
gotta
catch
all
the
flack
off
of
that
But
these
are
the
people
who
never
had
heard
of
an
Eminem
until
8
Mile
had
came
out
But
I
had
already
hit
middle
America
Parents
had
all
got
to
likin'
me
now
When
suddenly
I
wasn't
such
a
bad
guy
All
of
the
hatred
for
me
must've
died
Thought
I
committed
career
suicide
So
I
had
to
turn
back
into
the
bad
guy
So
faggoty
faggoty
faggoty
gays
Anatomy
God
made
Raggedy
Ann
and
Andy
Not
Raggedy
Andy
and
Andy
and
Andy
And
Angelina
Jolie
is
just
another
ho
And
Brad
is
a
sucka,
because
once
I
fuck
her
She
wants
to
go
to
Somalia
to
adopt
another
baby
You
know
what
I
say?
—
"No."
You
better
save
some
of
them
kids
from
Madonna
She
needs
all
the
publicity
she
can
get
You
wanted
Shady,
well
you
got
it,
man,
I
ain't
apologizin'
for
shit
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
and
I
don't
mean
to
gloat
But
I
know
what
I
know
and
I
know
what
you
think
And
these
magazines'll
never
put
it
in
ink
Because
how
would
it
look
If
they
considered
me
as
a
G.O.A.T.?
And
for
those
of
y'all
who
don't
know
what
a
G.O.A.T.
is
It
means
the
Greatest
Of
All
Time
And
I
consider
myself
one
of
those
So
thank
you
very
much,
here
it
goes
Man,
I'm
takin'
my
ball
and
goin'
home
Man,
shit
is
too
easy
Nobody
even
wants
to
pass
me
the
ball
‘Cause
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
So
don't
worry,
I'm
out
the
motherfuckin'
game
And
y'all
can
sit
and
argue
about
who's
the
motherfuckin'
best
But
y'all
know
that
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
And
like
I
said,
I'm
one
of
the
motherfuckin'
best
Before
you
get
your
panties
in
a
motherfuckin'
bunch
But
before
I
go,
I'd
like
to
say
fuck
you
very
much
To
everybody
who
wasn't
there
from
the
start
And
thank
you
very
much
to
everybody
who
was
And
y'all
ain't
gotta
say
it,
just
think
it
‘Cause
I
know
that
you
know
that
I
know
That
you
know
that
I
know
that
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
I'm
out
y'all,
it's
been
real—peace!
Thanks
it's
been
real
I
love
you
but
I
just
can't
deal
With
the
stress
this
game
is
giving
me...
But
before
I
go
You
know
I
can't
close
the
show
Without
no
closure
So
before
I
leave...
Yeah
I
just
want
to
take
the
time
out
to
basically
say
Rest
In
Peace
to
Deshaun
Holton
That's
my
heart
man
Dr.
Dre
For
giving
me
the
opportunity
Just
to
even
listen
to
me
To
get
me
to
this
point
I
wanna
thank
Jimmy
Iovine
Interscope,
Aftermath
Everybody
in
the
whole
Shady
staff
Everybody
who’s
basically
supported
me
from
day
one
Paul
Rosenberg,
Tracy
McNew
You
know
I
love
you
guys
I
couldn't
do
it
all
without
you
D12
Ca$his,
you're
gonna
be
a
beast
when
you
get
out
there
man
Trust
me
homie,
my
ears
don't
lie
to
me
Who
else
am
I
forgetting
Oh
yeah,
Obie
Trice
Bobby
Creekwater,
and
basically
man
The
whole
city
of
Detroit
8
mile
road
for
making
what
I
am
today
Which
basically
goes
back
to
Proof
and
D12
I
love
you
guys
man
Runyon
Ave
for
holding
me
down
when
shit
got
thick
Oh,
it
wouldn't
be
complete,
If
I
didn't
Thank
my
mom,
bitch
Haha
Thanks
it's
been
real
I
love
you
but
I
just
can't
deal
With
the
stress
this
game
is
giving
me...
But
before
I
go
You
know
I
can't
close
the
show
Without
no
closure
So
before
I
leave...
'Cause
some
things
just
don't
change
It's
better
when
they
stay
the
same
Although
the
whole
world
knows
your
name
Some
want
a
bigger
stage
They
came
to
see
you
spit
your
game,
whoa
But
it
shouldn't
be
difficult
to
explain
Just
why
you
came
back
again
You
hate
the
fame,
love
the
game
Cold
as
ice
you
remain,
fuck
'em
all
Tell
'em
all
eat
shit,
here
we
go
again
God
damn!
Is
it
that
time
again
already?
Haha,
okay
Y'all
don’t
look
too
happy
to
see
me
Fuck,
man
Don’t
everybody
welcome
me
back
at
once
All

Fuck

You

Fuck

And

You'll

your
butt

Yeah,

I
call
you

slut,

funny
Shorty,

while
I
diss
you
to
the
beat,

words
You

to
'em
anyway,

struck
a
nerve,
sucker
Motherfucker,
might
as
well
let
my
lips
pucker
Like
Elton
John,
'cause
I'm
just
a
mean
cocksucker
The
shit
is
on
'cause
you
went
and
pissed
me
off
Now
I'm
shittin'
and
pissin'
on
everybody
Give
a
fuck
if
it's
right
or
wrong
So
puff
the
Buddha,
light
a
bong,
but
take
a
look
at
Mariah
Next
time
I
inspire
you
to
write
a
song—come
on!
Oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh
I'm
as
cold
as
the
cold
wind
blows
When
it
snows
and
it's
twenty
below
Ask
me
why,
man,
I
just
don't
know
No-no-no,
no-no,
no
I'm
as
cold
as
the
cold
wind
blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow,
blows,
oh,
oh-oh
Fuck
it,
I'm
a
loose
cannon,
Bruce
Banner's
back
in
the
booth
Y'all
are
sittin'
ducks,
I'm
the
only
goose
standin'
I'll
set
the
world
on
fire,
piss
on
it,
put
it
out
Stick
my
dick
in
a
circle,
but
I'm
not
fuckin'
around
Motherfucker,
I'll
show
you
pussy-footin'
I'll
kick
a
bitch
in
the
cunt
'til
it
makes
a
queef
And
sounds
like
a
fuckin'
whoopee
cushion
Who
the
fuck
is
you
pushin'?
You
musta
mistook
me
for
some
sissy
soft
punk
Lookin'
for
some
nookie
or
bosom
Go
ahead,
fuckin'
hater,
push
me!
I
told
you
ain't
no
fuckin'
way
to
shush
me
Call
me
a
faggot
'cause
I
hate
a
pussy
Man
the
fuck
up,
sissy,
G's
up,
all
you
gardeners
freeze
up
Put
your
hoes
down,
"Shady
ease
up!
Man,
chill!"
Nah,
I
can't,
goddamn
it,
rap
is
a
landfill
Drop
the
anvil,
these
are
shoes
that
you
can't
fill
Shit,
the
day
that
happens
the
world
will
stop
spinnin'
And
Michael
J.
Fox'll
come
to
a
standstill
During
an
earthquake,
urine
in
your
face
(*Lightning
noise*)
Ow!
What
the
fuck?
I
just
got
struck
by
lightnin'
Alright
then,
I
quit,
God,
I
give
up
Call
it
evil
that
men
do
Lord,
forgive
me
for
what
my
pen
do
"This
is
for
your
sins,
I
cleanse
you
And
you
can
repent,
but
I
warn
you
If
you
continue,
to
Hell
I'll
send
you"
And
just
then
the
wind
blew,
and
I
said...
Oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh
I'm
as
cold
as
the
cold
wind
blows
When
it
snows
and
it's
twenty
below
Ask
me
why,
man,
I
just
don't
know
No-no-no,
no-no,
no
I'm
as
cold
as
the
cold
wind
blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow,
blows,
oh,
oh-oh-oh,
oh
How
long
will
I
be
this
way?
Shady
until
my
dyin'
day
'Til
I
hang
up
the
mic
and
it's
time
for
me
to
say
"So
long,"
'til
then,
I'll
drop
the
fuckin'
bombs
Like
I
missed
the
pass
when
I
went
long
If
you
don't
like
it,
you
can
kiss
my
ass
in
a
lint
thong
Now
sing
along,
slut
this,
slut
that,
learn
the
words
to
the
song
"Oh,
bitches
don't
like
that,"
homie,
I'll
be
nicer
to
women
When
Aquaman
drowns
and
the
Human
Torch
starts
swimmin'
Man,
I'm
a
cold
soul,
I
roll
solo
So,
don't
compare
me
to
them
other
bums
over
there
It's
like
apples
to
oranges,
peaches
to
plums,
yeah
I'm
bananas,
pussy,
cut
off
the
grapes
and
grow
a
pair
But
I
swear,
you
try
to
diss
me,
I'll
slaughter
you
I
put
that
on
everything,
like
everyone
does
with
Auto-Tune
The
last
thing
you
want
to
do
is
have
me
spit
out
a
rhyme
And
say,
"I
was
writing
this
and
I
thought
of
you,"
so
Oh,
oh-oh,
oh-oh,
oh
I'm
as
cold
as
the
cold
wind
blows
When
it
snows
and
it's
twenty
below
Ask
me
why,
man,
I
just
don't
know
No-no-no,
no-no,
no
I'm
as
cold
as
the
cold
wind
blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow,
blows,
oh,
oh-oh-oh,
oh
I
don't
know,
I
don't
know
what
caused
I
don't
know
what
caused
me
to
be
this
way
I
don't
know,
I
don't
know
But
I'll
probably
be
this
way
'til
my
dyin'
day
I
don't
know
why
I'm
so,
I'm
so
cold
Mean
things
I
don't
mean
to
say
I
guess
this
is
how
you
made
me
Ayo,
before
I
start
this
song,
man
I
just
wanna
thank
everybody
for
being
so
patient
And
bearing
with
me
over
these
last
couple
of
years
While
I
figure
this
shit
out
Is
anybody
out
there?
It
feels
like
I'm
talkin'
to
myself
No
one
seems
to
know
my
struggle
And
everything
I've
come
from
Can
anybody
hear
me?
Yeah,
I
guess
I
keep
talkin'
to
myself
It
feels
like
I'm
goin'
insane
Am
I
the
one
who's
crazy?
Yeah,
whoa-whoa,
whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa,
whoa-whoa,
whoa-whoa
So
why
in
the
world
do
I
feel
so
alone?
Nobody
but
me,
I'm
on
my
own
Is
there
anyone
out
there
who
feels
the
way
I
feel?
If
there
is,
let
me
hear
Just
so
I
know
that
I'm
not
the
only
one
I
went
away,
I
guess,
and
opened
up
some
lanes
But
there
was
no
one
who
even
knew
I
was
goin'
through
growin'
pains
Hatred
was
flowin'
through
my
veins
On
the
verge
of
goin'
insane
I
almost
made
a
song
dissin'
Lil
Wayne
It's
like
I
was
jealous
of
him
'cause
of
the
attention
he
was
gettin'
I
felt
horrible
about
myself,
he
was
spittin'
and
I
wasn't
Anyone
who
was
buzzin'
back
then
coulda
got
it
Almost
went
at
Kanye
too
God,
it
feels
like
I'm
goin'
psychotic,
thank
God
that
I
didn't
do
it
I'da
had
my
ass
handed
to
me,
and
I
knew
it
But
Proof
isn't
here
to
see
me
through
it
I'm
in
the
booth,
poppin'
another
pill,
tryna
talk
myself
into
it
Are
you
stupid?
You're
gon'
start
dissin'
people
for
no
reason?
'Specially
when
you
can't
even
write
a
decent
punchline
even?
You're
lyin'
to
yourself,
you're
slowly
dyin'
You're
denyin'
your
health
is
declinin'
with
your
self-esteem
You're
cryin'
out
for
help
Is
anybody
out
there?
It
feels
like
I'm
talkin'
to
myself
No
one
seems
to
know
my
struggle
And
everything
I've
come
from
Can
anybody
hear
me?
Yeah,
I
guess
I
keep
talkin'
to
myself
It
feels
like
I'm
goin'
insane
Am
I
the
one
who's
crazy?
Yeah
So
why
in
the
world
do
I
feel
so
alone?
Nobody
but
me,
I'm
on
my
own
Is
there
anyone
out
there
who
feels
the
way
I
feel?
If
there
is,
let
me
hear
Just
so
I
know
that
I'm
not
the
only
one
Marshall,
you're
no
longer
the
man,
that's
a
bitter
pill
to
swallow
All
I
know
is
I'm
wallowing,
self-loathing
and
hollow
Bottoms
up
on
the
pill
bottle,
maybe
I'll
hit
my
bottom
tomorrow
My
sorrow
echoes
in
this
hall
though
(Oh-oh,
oh)
But
I
must
be
talkin'
to
the
wall
though,
I
don't
see
nobody
else
(I
guess
I
keep
talkin'
to
myself)
But
all
these
other
rappers
suck
is
all
that
I
know
I've
turned
into
a
hater,
I
put
up
a
false
bravado
But
Marshall
is
not
an
egomaniac,
that's
not
his
motto
He's
not
a
desperado,
he's
desperate
His
thoughts
are
bottled
inside
him
One
foot
on
the
brake,
one
on
the
throttle
Fallin'
asleep
with
writer's
block
in
the
parkin'
lot
of
McDonald's
But
instead
of
feeling
sorry
for
yourself
Do
something
'bout
it,
admit
you
got
a
problem
Your
brain
is
clouded,
you
pouted
long
enough
It
isn't
them,
it's
you,
you
fuckin'
baby!
Quit
worryin'
'bout
what
they
do,
and
do
Shady
I'm
fuckin'
goin'
crazy
Is
anybody
out
there?
It
feels
like
I'm
talkin'
to
myself
No
one
seems
to
know
my
struggle
And
everything
I've
come
from
Can
anybody
hear
me?
Yeah,
I
guess
I
keep
talkin'
to
myself
It
feels
like
I'm
goin'
insane
Am
I
the
one
who's
crazy?
Yeah
So
why
in
the
world
do
I
feel
so
alone?
Nobody
but
me,
I'm
on
my
own
Is
there
anyone
out
there
who
feels
the
way
I
feel?
If
there
is,
let
me
hear
Just
so
I
know
that
I'm
not
the
only
one
So
I
picked
myself
up
off
the
ground
And
fuckin'
swam
'fore
I
drowned
Hit
my
bottom
so
hard
I
bounced
twice,
suffice,
this
time
around
It's
different,
them
last
two
albums
didn't
count
Encore,
I
was
on
drugs;
Relapse,
I
was
flushin'
'em
out
I've
come
to
make
it
up
to
you
now,
no
more
fuckin'
around
I
got
somethin'
to
prove
to
fans,
'cause
I
feel
like
I
let
'em
down
So
please
accept
my
apology,
I
finally
feel
like
I'm
back
to
normal
I
feel
like
me
again,
let
me
formally
Reintroduce
myself
to
you
for
those
of
you
who
don't
know
The
new
me's
back
to
the
old
me
And
homie,
I
don't
show
no
signs
of
slowin'
up
Oh,
and
I'm
blowin'
up
all
over
My
life
is
no
longer
a
movie,
but
the
show
ain't
over,
homos
I'm
back
with
a
vengeance,
homie
Weezy,
keep
ya
head
up,
T.I.,
keep
ya
head
up
Kanye,
keep
ya
head
up,
don't
let
up
Just
keep
slayin'
them,
rest
in
peace
to
DJ
AM
'Cause
I
know
what
it's
like
I
struggle
with
this
shit
every
single
day,
and
um…
Is
anybody
out
there?
It
feels
like
I'm
talkin'
to
myself
No
one
seems
to
know
my
struggle
And
everything
I've
come
from
Can
anybody
hear
me?
Yeah,
I
guess
I
keep
talkin'
to
myself
It
feels
like
I'm
goin'
insane
Am
I
the
one
who's
crazy?
Yeah
So
why
in
the
world
do
I
feel
so
alone?
Nobody
but
me,
I'm
on
my
own
Is
there
anyone
out
there
who
feels
the
way
I
feel?
If
there
is,
let
me
hear
Just
so
I
know
that
I'm
not
the
only
one
So
there
it
is,
damn
Feels
like
I
just
woke
up
or
something
I
guess
I
just
forgot
who
the
fuck
I
was,
man
Ayo,
and
to
anybody
I
thought
about
going
at
It
was
never
nothing
personal
It
was
just
some
shit
I
was
going
through
And
to
everybody
else,
I'm
back!
(I'm
back!)
Ha-ha
(Ha-ha)
You
know,
critics,
man
Critics
never
got
nothin'
nice
to
say,
man
You
know,
the
one
thing
I
notice
about
critics,
man
Is
critics
never
ask
me
how
my
day
went
Well,
I'ma
tell
'em
Augh,
yesterday
my
dog
died
I
hog
tied
a
ho,
tied
her
in
a
bow
Said:
"Next
time
you
blog,
try
to
spit
a
flow."
You
wanna
criticize,
dog?
Try
a
little
mo'
I'm
so
tired
of
this
I
could
blow,
fire
in
the
hole
I'm
fired
up,
so
fire
up
the
lighter
and
the
dro
Better
hold
on
a
little
tighter,
here
I
go
Flows
tighter,
hot-headed
as
Ghost
Rider
Cold-hearted
as
Spider-Man
throwing
a
spider
in
the
snow
So
you
better
get
lower
than
Flo-rida
Inside
of
a
lowrider
with
no
tires,
in
a
hole
Why
am
I
like
this?
Why
is
winter
cold?
Why
is
it
when
I
talk
I'm
so
biased
to
the
hoes?
Listen,
dog,
Christmas
is
off,
this
is
as
soft
as
it
gets
This
isn't
golf,
this
is
a
blistering
assault
Those
are
your
wounds,
this
is
the
salt,
so
get
lost
Shit,
dissin'
me
is
just
like
pissin'
off
the
Wizard
of
Oz
Wrap
a
lizard
in
gauze
Beat
you
in
the
jaws
with
it,
grab
the
scissors
and
saws
And
cut
out
your
livers,
gizzards,
and
balls
Throw
you
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
in
a
blizzard
with
Jaws
So
sip
piss
like
sizzurp
through
a
straw
Then
describe
how
it
tasted
like
dessert
to
us
all
Got
the
gall
to
make
Chris
piss
in
his
drawers
Tickle
him,
go
to
his
grave,
skip
him,
and
visit
his
dog
(You're
on
fire)
That's
how
you
know
you're
on
a
roll
'Cause
when
you're
hot
it's
like
you're
burning
up
everyone
else's
cold
(You're
on
fire)
Man,
I'm
so
fuckin'
sick
I
got
ambulances
pullin'
me
over
and
shit
(You're
on
fire)
You
need
to
stop,
drop,
and
roll
'Cause
when
you
say
the
shit
to
get
the
whole
hip-hop
shop
to
blow
(You're
on
fire)
(You're
on
fire)
I
just
put
a
bullshit
hook
in
between
two
long-ass
verses
If
you
mistook
this
for
a
song,
look,
this
ain't
a
song
It's
a
warning
to
Brooke
Hogan
and
David
Cook
That
the
crook
just
took
over,
so
book
Run
as
fast
as
you
can,
stop
writing
and
kill
it
I'm
lightning
in
a
skillet,
you're
a
fuckin'
flash
in
the
pan
I
pop
up,
you
bitches
scatter
like
hot
grease
splashing
a
fan
Mr.
Mathers
is
the
man,
yeah,
I'm
pissed
But
I
would
rather
take
this
energy
and
stash
it
in
a
can
Come
back
and
whip
your
ass
with
it
again
Saliva's
like
sulfuric
acid
in
your
hand
It'll
eat
through
anything,
metal,
the
ass
of
Iron
Man
Turn
him
into
plastic
So
for
you
to
think
that
you
could
stand
a
fuckin'
chance
is
asinine
Yeah,
ask
Denaun,
man
Hit
a
blind
man
with
a
coloring
book
And
told
him
color
inside
the
lines
or
get
hit
with
a
flying
crayon
Fuck
it,
I
ain't
playin',
pull
up
in
a
van
And
hop
out
on
a
homeless
man
holding
a
sign
sayin'
"Vietnam
vet",
I'm
out
my
fuckin'
mind,
man
Kick
over
the
can,
beat
his
ass,
and
leave
him
nine
grand
So
if
I
seem
a
little
mean
to
you
This
ain't
savage,
you
ain't
never
seen
a
brute
You
wanna
get
graphic,
we
can
go
the
scenic
route
You
couldn't
make
a
bulimic
puke
On
a
piece
of
fuckin'
corn
and
peanut
poop
Sayin'
you

quit
playin',
you
prick,
don't
nobody
care
And
why
the
fuck
am
I
yellin'
at
air
I
ain't
even
talkin'
to
no
one,
'cause
ain't
nobody
there
And
nobody
will
fuckin'
test
me
'Cause
these
hoes
won't
even
dare
I'm
wasting
punchlines,
but
I
got
so
many
to
spare
I
just
thought
of
another
one
that
might
go
here
Nah,
don't
waste
it,
save
it,
psycho—yeah
Plus

got
to
rewrite
those
lines
That

about
Michael's
hair
(Woops!)
(You're

That's
how
you
know
you're
on
a
roll
'Cause
when
you're
hot
it's
like
you're
burning
up
everyone
else's
cold
(You're
on
fire)
Man,

so
hot
My
motherfuckin'
firetruck's
on

(You're

You

'Cause

You

Get

Shady's

White

Trailer

You

You

Does
Lil'
Wayne
slurp
'zurp
'Til
he
burps
and
smoke
purp?
Does
a
word
search
get
circles
wrapped
around
it
Like
you
do
when
I
come
through?
I'd
like
you
to
remind
yourself
of
what

When
I'm

Oh,

Been

You're

Got

Turn

Shut

I'm

What's
the
saying?
Where
there's
thunder,
there
is
lightning
And
they
say
that
it
never
strikes
twice
in
the
same
place
Then
how
the
fuck
have
I
been
hit
six
times
In
three
different
locations
on
four
separate
occasions?
And
you
can
bet
your
stankin'
ass
That
I've
come

everything
in
my
path
Fork

the
psycho
path
Poison
Ivy

So

the
dance-floor,
cutie,
while
I
do
my
duty
On
this
microphone;
shake
your
booty,
shorty!
I'm
the
shit—why
you
think
Proof
used
to
call
me
"Doody"?
You
can
sound
the
alarm,
you
can
call
out
your
guards
You
can
fence
in
your
yard,
you
can
hold
all
the
cards
But
I
won't
back
down
Oh
no,
I
won't
back
down,
oh
no
Yeah!
Oh!
Get
up
(Where
my
trash
at?)
I
said,
get
up
You
know
what
happens
when
I'm
around,
man
Woo!
Let's
go
Better
watch
out
now
'cause
here
we
come
And
we
ain’t
stoppin'
until
we
see
the
morning
sun
So
give
us
room
to
do
our
thing
'Cause
we
ain’t
come
to
hurt
no
one
So
everybody
come
and
get
up
on
the
floor
now
And
grab
someone
Man,
first
of
all;
I’m
a
boss
I
just
want
to
get
that
across
Man,
even
my
dentist
hates
when
I
floss
Pull
up
to
the
club
in
a
Pinto
like
it’s
a
Porsche
Garbage
bag
for
one
of
the
windows,
spray-painted
doors
With
the
flames
on
‘em,
Michigan
plates,
and
my
name's
on
‘em
Baby,
Shady’s
here,
come
and
get
him
if
you
dames
want
him
But
he
ain’t
stupid
so
quit
tryna
run
them
games
on
him
He's
immune
to
Cupid,
why
you
tryna
put
your
claims
on
him?
'Cause
you
won’t
do
to
me
what
you
did
to
the
last
man
Now
climb
in
back,
try
not
to
kick
over
the
gas
can
There’s
a
half
a
gallon
in
it,
that
could
be
our
last
chance
We
have
of
just
gettin'
home,
now
can
I
get
that
lap
dance?
She’s
got
a
tattoo
of
me
right
above
her
ass,
man
In
the
streets
of
Warren,
Michigan,
we
call
‘em
tramp
stamps
That
means
she
belongs
to
me,
time
to
put
the
damn
clamps
down
And
show
this
hussy
who’s
the
man
now
get
amped,
dance
Now
you
can
do
this
on
your
own
But
everyone
knows
that
no
one
likes
to
be
alone
So
get
on
the
floor
and
grab
somebody
Ain't
nothin'
but
a
white
trash
party
(white
trash
party)
So
let’s
have
us
a
little
bash
And
if
anyone
asks,
it
ain’t
no
one
but
us
trash
You
don’t
know,
you
better
ask
somebody
'Cause
we’re
having
a
white
trash
party
(white
trash
party)
Pull
a
fifth
of
Bacardi
from
out
of
my
underwear
And
walk
around
the
party
without
a
care
Like
a
body
without
a
head
Lookin'
like
a
zombie
from
Night
of
the
Living
Dead
And
tomorrow
I'll
probably
still
be
too
high
to
get
out
of
bed
'Til
I
feel
like
I
been
hit
with
the
sharp
part
of
the
hammer
I'm
mixin'
Hennessy
and
Fanta
with
Pepto
and
Mylanta
I
shoot
the
gift
like
I’m
hollering
"Die
Santa"
Missed
the
tree
and
hit
Rudolph
and
two
innocent
bystanders
So
quit
tryna
play
the
wall
like
you
Paul
And
get
on
the
floor
when
the
beat
drops
and
stop
stallin'
They
call
me
the
Stephon
Marbury
of
rap,
darlin'
'Cause
as
soon
as
they
throw
on
some
R.
Kelly,
I
start
ballin'
Makin'
it
rain
for
the
ladies
in
the
minis
But
I’m
not
throwin'
ones,
fives,
tens,
or
even
twenties
I’m
throwin'
quarters,
nickels,
dimes,
pennies
up
at
skinnies
Man,
I
do
this
for
them
bunnies
up
at
Denny’s
From
the
North,
East,
and
West
But
when
it
comes
to
them
trailers
in
them
South
parks
Muffle
it,
'cause,
homie,
that
hood’s
tighter
than
Kenny’s
So,
ladies,
if
your
belly
button’s
not
an
innie,
then
I’m
outtie
Now
hop
in
my
minivan,
let's
get
rowdy
Come
on
Now
you
can
do
this
on
your
own
But
everyone
knows
that
no
one
likes
to
be
alone
So
get
on
the
floor
and
grab
somebody
Ain't
nothin'
but
a
white
trash
party
(white
trash

So
let’s
have
us
a
little
bash
And
if
anyone
asks,
it
ain’t
no
one
but
us
trash
You
don’t
know,
you
better
ask
somebody
'Cause
we’re
having
a
white
trash
party
(white
trash
party)
Now
whether
you’re
black,
white,
or
purple
If
you’re
misunderstood
But
you
don’t
give
a
fuck,
you
ain’t
doin'
shit
that
you
should
Long
as
you
know
you’re
up
to
evil
and
you’re
no
damn
good
Get
on
the
floor,
man,
and
rep
your
hood
Now
honey,
don’t
let
them
pricks
trip
We
should
make
a
quick
dip
And
go
do
some
doughnuts
in
the
hospital
parking
lot
'Cause,
girl—I
got
a
sick
whip
Kick
the
back
window
outta
my
Gremlin
Put
two
milk
crates
in
the
trunk,
rip
out
the
stick
shift
And
make
a
five-seater,
I’ll
be
damned
if
I
feed
a
chick
It
ain’t
like
me
to
split
a
piece
of
dry
pita
I
be
the
S-L-to-the-I-M
to
the
S-H-A-D-Y
And
I
don’t
need
a
tank
top
to
be
a
wife
beater
I’ll
rip
a
tree
out
the
ground
and
flip
it
upside
down
'Fore
I
turn
over
a
new
leaf,
clown
I’ll
tell
you
now,
I’m
so
raw,
I
still
need
to
unthaw
You
feel
me,
y'all?
I
shut
the
club
down
like
Drake
in
the
mall
But
baby,
a
body
like
that’s
against
the
law
You
the
baddest
little
chain
with
the
blades
I
ever
saw
Coleslaw
containers,
empty
straw
wrappers
and
all
You
got
more
junk
in
your
trunk
than
I
do
in
my
car
Now
get
up
Now
you
can
do
this
on
your
own
But
everyone
knows
that
no
one
likes
to
be
alone
So
get
on
the
floor
and
grab
somebody
Ain't
nothin'
but
a
white
trash
party
So
let’s
have
us
a
little
bash
And
if
anyone
asks,
it
ain’t
no
one
but
us
trash
You
don’t
know,
you
better
ask
somebody
'Cause
we’re
having
a
white
trash
party
(white
trash
party)
I'm
going
through
changes
I'm
going
through
changes
Lately
I
really
feel
like
I'm
rollin'
for
delf
Like
Philly,
feel
like
I'm
losin'
control
of
myself
I
sincerely
apologize
if
all
that
I
sound
like
Is
I'm
complainin'
but
life
keeps
on
complicatin'
And
I'm
debatin'
on
leavin'
this
world
this
evenin'
Even
my
girls
can
see
I'm
grievin',
I
try
and
hide
it
But
I
can't,
why
do
I
act
like
I'm
all
high
and
mighty
When
inside
I'm
dyin'?
I
am
finally
realizin'
I
need
Help,
can't
do
it
myself,
too
weak
Two
weeks
I've
been
havin'
ups
and
downs
goin'
through
peaks
And
valleys,
dilly-dallyin'
'round
with
the
idea
I
walk
around
the
house
tryna
fight
mirrors
I
can't
stand
what
I
look
like,
yeah
I
look
fat
But
what
do
I
care?
I
give
a
fuck
Only
thing
I
fear's
Hailie,
I'm
afraid
if
I
close
my
eyes,
that
I
might
see
her...
shit
I'm
going
through
changes
I'm
going
through
changes
I
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom,
bathroom,
nappin'
at
noon
Yeah,
Dad's
in
a
bad
mood,
he's
always
snappin'
at
you
Marshall,
what
happened
that
you
can't
stop
with
these
pills?
And
you've
fallen
off
with
your
skills
and
your
own
fans
are
laughin'
at
you
It
become
a
problem
you're
too
pussy
to
tackle?
Get
up
Be
a
man,
stand,
a
real
man
woulda
had
this
shit
handled
Know
you
just
had
your
heart
ripped
out
and
crushed
They
say
Proof
just
flipped
out,
homie
just
whipped
out
and
bust
Nah,
it
ain't
like
Doody
to
do
that,
he
wouldn't
fuckin'
Shoot
at
nobody,
he'd
fight
first,
but
dwellin'
On
it
only
makes
the
night
worse,
now
I'm
poppin'
Vics,
Percs
And
Methadone
pills,
"Yeah,
Em,
tight
verse
You
killed
it!"
Fuckin'
drug
dealers
hang
around
me
like
yes
men
And
they
gon'
do
whatever
I
says
when
I
says
it
It's
in
their
best
interest
to
protect
their
investment
And
I
just
lost
my
fuckin'
best
friend,
so
fuck
it,
I
guess
then—
(I'm
going
through
changes)
Don’t
know
what
I’m
gonna
do
(I'm
going
through
changes)
But
I
just
keep
on
going
through
changes
My
friends
can't
understand
this
new
me,
that's
understandable
Man,
but
think
how
bananas
you'd
be,
you'd
be
an
animal
too
If
you
were
trapped
in
this
fame
and
caged
in
it
like
a
zoo
And
everybody's
lookin'
at
you,
what
you
want
me
to
do?
I'm
startin'
to
live
like
a
recluse
And
the
truth
is,
fame's
startin'
to
give
me
an
excuse
To
be
at
an
all-time
low;
I
sit
alone
in
my
home
theater
Watchin'
the
same
damn
DVD
of
the
First
tour;
the
last
tour,
he
was
still
alive
And
it
hurts
so
I
fast
forward,
sleeping
pills'll
make
me
feel
alright
And
if
I'm
still
awake
in
the
middle
of
the
night
I'll
just
take
a
couple
more,
yeah,
you're
motherfuckin'
right
I
ain't
slowin'
down
for
no
one,
I
am
almost
homeward
bound
Almost
in
a
coma,
yeah
homie,
come
on,
dole
'em
out!
"Daddy,
don't
you
die
on
me!
Daddy,
better
hold
your
ground!"
Fuck,
don't
I
know
the
sound
of
that
voice?
Yeah,
baby,
hold
me
down
(Daddy!)
(I'm
going
through
changes)
(Daddy!)
Don’t
know
what
I’m
gonna
do
(I'm
going
through
changes)
But
I
just
keep
on
going
through
changes
Wake
up
in
the
hospital,
full
of
tubes,
but
somehow
I'm
pullin'
through
Swear
when
I
come
back
I'ma
be
bulletproof
I'ma
do
it
just
for
Proof,
I
think
I
should
state
a
few
Facts,
'cause
I
may
not
get
a
chance
again
to
say
the
truth
Shit,
it
just
hit
me
that
what
if
I
would
not've
made
it
through?
I
think
about
the
things
I
woulda
never
got
to
say
to
you
I'd
never
get
to
make
it
right,
so
here's
what
I
came
to
do
Hailie,
this
one
is
for
you,
Whitney
and
Alaina
too
I
still
love
your
mother,
that'll
never
change
Think
about
her
every
day,
we
just
could
never
get
it
together,
hey
Wish
there
was
a
better
way
for
me
to
say
it
But
I
swear
on
everything,
I'd
do
anything
for
her
on
any
day
There
are
just
too
many
things
to
explain,
when
it
rains
Guess
it
pours
—
yes,
it
does,
wish
there
wasn't
any
pain
But
I
can't
pretend
there
ain't,
I
ain't
placin'
any
blame
I
ain't
pointin'
fingers,
Heaven
knows
I've
never
been
a
saint
I
know
that
it
feels
like
we
just
pissed
away
our
history
And
just
today
I
looked
at
your
picture,
almost
if
to
say
I
miss
you
subconsciously,
wish
it
didn't
end
this
way
But
I
just
had
to
get
away,
don't
know
why,
I
don't
know
what
else
to
say,
I
guess
I'm—
(I'm
going
through
changes)
Don’t
know
what
I’m
gonna
do
(I'm
going
through
changes)
But
I
just
keep
on
going
through
changes
I'm
not
afraid
(I'm
not
afraid)
To
take
a
stand
(To
take
a
stand)
Everybody
(Everybody)
Come
take
my
hand
(Come
take
my
hand)
We'll
walk
this
road
together,
through
the
storm
Whatever
weather,
cold
or
warm
Just
lettin'
you
know
that
you're
not
alone
Holla
if
you
feel
like
you've
been
down
the
same
road
Yeah,
it's
been
a
ride
I
guess
I
had
to
go
to
that
place
to
get
to
this
one
Now
some
of
you
might
still
be
in
that
place
If
you're
tryna
get
out,
just
follow
me
I'll
get
you
there
You
can
try
and
read
my
lyrics
off
of
this
paper
before
I
lay
'em
But
you
won't
take
the
sting
out
these
words
before
I
say
'em
'Cause
ain't
no
way
I'ma
let
you
stop
me
from
causin'
mayhem
When
I
say
I'ma
do
somethin',
I
do
it
I
don't
give
a
damn
what
you
think,
I'm
doin'
this
for
me
So
fuck
the
world,
feed
it
beans
It's
gassed
up
if
it
thinks
it's
stoppin'
me
I'ma
be
what
I
set
out
to
be,
without
a
doubt,
undoubtably
And
all
those
who
look
down
on
me
I'm
tearin'
down
your
balcony
No
ifs,
ands
or
buts,
don't
try
to
ask
him
why
or
how
can
he
From
Infinite
down
to
the
last
Relapse
album
he's
still
shittin'
Whether
he's
on
salary,
paid
hourly
Until
he
bows
out
or
he
shits
his
bowels
out
of
him
Whichever
comes
first,
for
better
or
worse
He's
married
to
the
game
Like
a
"fuck
you"
for
Christmas,
his
gift
is
a
curse
Forget
the
Earth,
he's
got
the
urge
to
pull
his
dick
from
the
dirt
And
fuck
the
whole
universe
I'm
not
afraid
(I'm
not
afraid)
To
take
a
stand
(To
take
a
stand)
Everybody
(Everybody)
Come
take
my
hand
(Come
take
my
hand)
We'll
walk
this
road
together,
through
the
storm
Whatever
weather,
cold
or
warm
Just
lettin'
you
know
that
you're
not
alone
Holla
if
you
feel
like
you've
been
down
the
same
road
Okay,
quit
playin'
with
the
scissors
and
shit,
and
cut
the
crap
I
shouldn't
have
to
rhyme
these
words
in
a
rhythm
For
you
to
know
it's
a
rap
You
said
you
was
king,
you
lied
through
your
teeth
For
that,
fuck
your
feelings
Instead
of
gettin'
crowned,
you're
gettin'
capped
And
to
the
fans,
I'll
never
let
you
down
again,
I'm
back
I
promise
to
never
go
back
on
that
promise
In
fact,
let's
be
honest,
that
last
Relapse
CD
was
"ehh"
Perhaps
I
ran
them
accents
into
the
ground
Relax,
I
ain't
goin'
back
to
that
now
All
I'm
tryin'
to
say
is
get
back,
click-clack-blaow
'Cause
I
ain't
playin'
around
There's
a
game
called
circle
and
I
don't
know
how
I'm
way
too
up
to
back
down
But
I
think
I'm
still
tryin'
to
figure
this
crap
out
Thought
I
had
it
mapped
out,
but
I
guess
I
didn't
This
fuckin'
black
cloud
still
follows
me
around
But
it's
time
to
exorcise
these
demons
These
muh'fuckers
are
doin'
jumpin'
jacks
now
I'm
not
afraid
(I'm
not
afraid)
To
take
a
stand
(To
take
a
stand)
Everybody
(Everybody)
Come
take
my
hand
(Come
take
my
hand)
We'll
walk
this
road
together,
through
the
storm
Whatever
weather,
cold
or
warm
Just
lettin'
you
know
that
you're
not
alone
Holla
if
you
feel
like
you've
been
down
the
same
road
And
I
just
can't
keep
livin'
this
way
So
startin'
today
I'm
breakin'
out
of
this
cage
I'm
standin'
up,
I'ma
face
my
demons
I'm
mannin'
up,
I'ma
hold
my
ground
I've
had
enough,
now
I’m
so
fed
up
Time
to
put
my
life
back
together
right
now
It
was
my
decision
to
get
clean,
I
did
it
for
me
Admittedly
I
probably
did
it
subliminally
for
you
So
I
could
come
back
a
brand-new
me
You
helped
see
me
through
And
don't
even
realize
what
you
did,
believe
me
you
I've
been
through
the
wringer
But
they
can
do
little
to
the
middle
finger
I
think
I
got
a
tear
in
my
eye,
I
feel
like
the
king
of
My
world,
haters
can
make
like
bees
with
no
stingers
And
drop
dead:
no
more
beef
lingers
No
more
drama
from
now
on,
I
promise
To
focus
solely
on
handlin'
my
responsibilities
as
a
father
So
I
solemnly
swear
to
always
treat
this
roof
like
my
daughters
And
raise
it,
you
couldn't
lift
a
single
shingle
on
it
'Cause
the
way
I
feel,
I'm
strong
enough
to
go
to
the
club
Or
the
corner
pub
and
lift
the
whole
liquor
counter
up
'Cause
I'm
raisin'
the
bar
I'd
shoot
for
the
moon,
but
I'm
too
busy
gazin'
at
stars
I
feel
amazin',
and
I'm—
I'm
not
afraid
(I'm
not
afraid)
To
take
a
stand
(To
take
a
stand)
Everybody
(Everybody)
Come
take
my
hand
(Come
take
my
hand)
We'll
walk
this
road
together,
through
the
storm
Whatever
weather,
cold
or
warm
Just
lettin'
you
know
that
you're
not
alone
Holla
if
you
feel
like
you've
been
down
the
same
road
Like
a
verbal
seduction
when
Seduction
when
I
tell
'em
girls
on
the
floor
I
don't
know,
man
(Geh-geh-geh)
Just
feels
like
we're
a
lot
different
(Right
now)
(Girls
on
the
floor)
It
kinda
feels
like
(Like
a
verbal
seduction
when)
I'm
on
a
whole
different
page
right
now
than
you
(Girls
on
the
floor)
It
feels
strange,
but
umm
(Girls
on
the
floor)
I
guess
it's
kinda
like,
it's
kinda
like...
I
feel
like
I'm
morphin'
into
somethin'
that's
so
incredible
That
I'm
dwarfin'
all
competitors
Better
get
your
girlfriend
in
check
It's
psychological
warfare,
endorphins
I
effect
Your
self-esteem
shatters
as
dialect
comes
blastin'
out
your
deck
She
loves
me,
such
passion,
you'd
expect
This
sort
of
reaction
from
her,
yet
you
strong-arm
You're
fuckin'
corny,
you
try
to
turn
your
charm
on
'Cause
you
just
think
you're
Bishop
the
Don
Juan
But
if
you
think
that
you're
fuckin'
with
me,
homie,
you're
on
one
I'm
cockin'
my
head
back
like
Ed
Lover,
"C'mon,
son!"
She's
on
my
Johnson,
she
brings
my
name
up
constant
Your
boys
are
like,
"She's
fuckin'
with
dude,
she
wants
some"
Homeboy,
you
better
get
a
clue
She's
on
my
dick
'cause
I
spit
better
than
you
What
you
expect
her
to
do?
How
you
expect
her
to
act
in
the
sack
when
she's
closin'
her
eyes
Fantasizin'
of
diggin'
her
nails
in
my
back
to
this
track?
Seduction,
seduce
Ain't
nobody
who's
as
good
at
what
I
do
(It's
like
a
verbal
seduction
when)
'Cause
one
minute
she
loves
you,
the
next
she
don't
She's
been
stolen
from
you

She's
sittin'
there
gettin'
liquored
up
at
the
bar
She
says
it's
quicker
to
count
the
things
that
ain't
wrong
with
you
Than
to
count
the
things
that
are
There's
a
seven-disc
CD
changer
in
her
car
And
I'm
in
every
single
slot,
and
you're
not
—
aww!
I'm
the
logo
on
that
Dallas
Cowboy
helmet:
a
star
And
I'm
not
about
to
sit
back
And
just
keep
rhymin'
one
syllable
—
naw!
Switch
it
up
and
watch
them
haters
not
give
it
up
'Cause
they're
just
not
good
enough,
but
I'm
not
givin'
up
'Til
I
get
my
respect
and
I
won't
stop
'til
I
get
enough
'Cause
I'm
not
livin'
up
to
my
own
expectations
(Aww!)
That
hater
alarm
is
soundin'
off
And
Obama
took
the
bomb
from
my
name
(Aww!)
So
quit
cryin'
that
I
took
your
dame,
homie,
she's
my
dame
(Aww!)
You
sadly
mistaken
if
you
thinkin'
that
I'm
not
on
my
game,
boy
And
things
just
ain't
been
the
same
since
the
day
that
I
came
forth
You
wear
your
heart
on
your
sleeve,
I
sport
that
white
tank,
boy
But
you
got
a
hard-on
for
me,
what

hollerin'
my
name
for?
It's
your

it

You

Come

Put

While

With

Rummage

If

but

Prick,

You

Fire
Marshall:
I
shut
the

down
Your
entire
arsenal
is
not
enough
to
fuck
with
one
round
I
am
also
the
opposite
of
what
you
are
like
You're
a
microcosm
of
what
the
fuck
I
am
on
the
mic
I
am
awesome
and
you
are
just
awe-struck
She's
love-stricken,

got
her

stuck
From
suckin'
my

Throw

But

Yeah,
my
life
a

Been

I'm

Sweets,

sour
Married
to

but
she
broke
her
vows
That's
why
my
bars
are
full
of
broken
bottles
And
my
nightstands
are
full
of
open
Bibles
Uh,
I
think
about
more
than
I
forget
But
I
don't
go
around
fire
expectin'
not
to
sweat
And
these
niggas
know
I
lay
'em
down,
make
your
bed
Bitches
try
to
kick
me
while
I'm
down,
I'll
break
your
leg
Money
outweighin'
problems
on
a
triple
beam
I'm

you
niggas
skippin'
scenes
Uh,

Fuckin'

my
gun,
semi-Cartermatic
Yeah,

a
dick
in
they
mouth,
so
I
guess
it's
fuck
what
they
say
I'm
high
as
a
bitch,
up,
up
and
away
Man,
I'll
come
down
in
a
couple
of
days
Okay,
you
want
me
up
in
the
cage?
Then
I'll
come
out
in
beast
mode
I
got
this
world
stuck
in
the
safe,
combination
is
the
G
code
It's
Weezy,
motherfucker,
Blood
gang,
and
I'm
in
bleed
mode
All
about
my
dough,
but
I
don't
even
check
the
peephole
So
you
can
keep
knockin',
but
won't
knock
me
down
No
love
lost,
no
love
found
It's
a
little
too
late
to
say
that
you're
sorry
now
(yeah)
You
kicked
me
when
I
was
down
But
what
you
say
just
don't
(hurt
me)
That's
right,
it
don't
(hurt
me)
And
I
don't
need
you
(no
more)
Don't
wanna
see
you
(no
more)
Ha,
bitch,
you
get
no
(love)
You
showed
me
nothing
but
hate
(haha!)
You
ran
me
into
the
ground
But
what
comes
around
goes
around
(yeah)
And
I
don't
need
you
(don't
hurt
me)
That's
right,
you
don't
(hurt
me)
And
I
don't
need
you
(no
more)
Don't
wanna
see
you
Ha,
bitch,
you
get
(no
love)
No!
(No

No!
(No
love)

(No

Ha,

No!
(No

No!
(No

And
I
don't
need
you
(no
more)
Get
'em!
I'm
alive
again,
more
alive
than
I
have
been
In
my
whole
entire
life,
I
can
(yeah)
See
these
people's
ears
perk
up
as
I
begin
to
spaz
with
the
pen
Uh,
I'm
a
little
bit
sicker
than
most
Shit's
finna
get
thick
again,
they
say
the
competition
is
stiff
But
I
get
a
hard
dick
from
this
shit
and
I
stick
it
in
I
ain't
never
giving
in
again
(yeah)
Caution
to
the
wind,
complete
freedom
Look
at
these
rappers,
how
I
treat
'em
So
why
the
fuck
would
I
join
'em
when
I
beat
'em?
(yeah!)
They
call
me
a
freak,
'cause
I
like
to
Spit
on
these
pussies
'fore
I
eat
'em
(haha)
Man,
get
these
whack
cocksuckers
off
stage!
Where
the
fuck
is
Kanye
when
you
need
him?
(oh!)
Snatch
the
mic
from
'em,
bitch,
I'ma
let
you
finish
in
a
minute
Yeah,
that
rap
was
tight,
but
I'm
(yeah!)
'Bout
to
spit
the
greatest
verse
of
all
time
So
you
might
want
to
go
back
to
the
lab
tonight
and,
um
(yeah!)
Scribble
out
them
rhymes
you
were
gonna
spit
And
start
over
from
scratch
and
write
new
ones
But
I'm
afraid
that
it
ain't
gonna
make
no
difference
When
I
rip
this
stage
and
tear
it
in
half
tonight
It's
an
adrenaline
rush
to
feel
the
bass
thump
From
the
place
all
the
way
to
the
parking
lot,
fellow
Set
fire
to
the
mic
and
ignite
the
crowd
(yeah)
You
can
see
the
sparks
from
hot
metal
(yeah)
Cold-hearted,
from
the
day
I
Bogarted
The
game,
my
soul
started
to
rot,
fellow
(yeah)
When
I'm
not
even
in
my
harshest
You
can
still
get
roasted,
‘cause
Marsh
is
not
mellow
'Til
I'm
topplin'
from
the
top,
I'm
not
gonna
stop
I'm
standin'
on
my
Monopoly
board
(uh)
That
means
I'm
on
top
of
my
game
And
it
don't
stop
'til
my
hip
don't
hop
anymore
(shit)
When
you're
so
good
that
you
can't
say
it
‘Cause
it
ain't
even
cool
for
you
to
sound
cocky
anymore
(shit)
People
just
get
sick
‘cause
you
spit
These
fools
can't
drool
or
dribble
a
drop
anymore
(ow!)
And
you
can
never
break
my
stride
(nope)
You'll
never
slow
the
momentum
at
any
moment
I'm
'bout
to
blow,
you'll
never
take
my
pride
Killin'
the
flow,
slow
venom
And
the
opponent
is
gettin'
no
mercy,
mark
my
words
Ain't
lettin'
up,
relentless,
I
smell
blood
I
don't
give
a
fuck,
keep
givin'
them
hell
Where
was
you
when
I
fell
and
needed
help
up?
You
get
no
love
It's
a
little
too
late
to
say
that
you're
sorry
now
(uh)
You
kicked
me
when
I
was
down
But
what
you
say
just
don't
(hurt
me)
Yeah,
that's
right,
it
don't
(hurt
me)
And
I
don't
need
you
(no
more)
Don't
wanna
see
you
(no
more)
Ha,
bitch,
you
get
no
(love)
You
showed
me
nothing
but
hate
(yeah!)
You
ran
me
into
the
ground
But
what
comes
around
goes
around
And
I
don't
need
you
(don't
hurt
me)
That's
right,
you
don't
(hurt
me)
And
I
don't
need
you
(no
more)
Don't
wanna
see
you
Ha,
bitch,
you
get
(no
love)
No!
(No
love)
No!
(No
love)
No!
(No
love)
Ha,
bitch,
you
get
(no
love)
No!
(No
love)
No!
(No
love)
And
I
don't
need
you
(no
more)
Ha,
bitch,
you
get
(no
love)
We
touch,
I
feel
a
rush;
we
clutch,
it
isn't
much
But
it's
enough
to
make
me
wonder
what's
in
store
for
us
It's
lust,
it's
torturous,
you
must
be
a
sorceress
'Cause
you
just
did
the
impossible:
gained
my
trust
Don't
play
games,
it'll
be
dangerous
If
you
fuck
me
over,
‘cause
if
I
get
burnt,
I'ma
show
ya
What
it's
like
to
hurt,
‘cause
I
been
treated
like
dirt
before
ya
And
love
is
evil
—
spell
it
backwards,
I'll
show
ya
Nobody
knows
me,
I'm
cold,
walk
down
this
road
all
alone
It's
no
one's
fault
but
my
own,
it's
the
path
I've
chosen
to
go
Frozen
as
snow,
I
show
no
emotion
whatsoever
so
Don't
ask
me
why
I
have
no
love
for
these
muh'fuckin'
hoes
Bloodsuckin'
succubuses,
what
the
fuck
is
up
with
this?
I've
tried
in
this
department,
but
I
ain't
had
no
luck
with
this
It
sucks,
but
it's
exactly
what
I
thought
it
would
be
like
Tryin'
to
start
over,
I
got
a
hole
in
my
heart
But
some
kind
of
emotional
roller
coaster
Is
something
I
won't
go
on
So
you
toy
with
my
emotions,
so
it's
over
It's
like
an
explosion
every
time
I
hold
ya
Wasn't
joking
when
I
told
ya
You
take
my
breath
away,
you're
a
supernova,
and
I'm
a—
I'm
a
space-bound
rocket
ship
and
your
heart's
the
Moon
And
I'm
aimin'
right
at
you,
right
at
you
250,000
miles
on
a
clear
night
in
June
And
I'm
aimin'
right
at
you
Right
at
you,
right
at
you
I'll
do
whatever
it
takes,
when
I'm
with
you,
I
get
the
shakes
My
body
aches
when
I
ain't
with
you,
I
have
zero
strength
There's
no
limit
on
how
far
I
would
go,
no
boundaries,
no
lengths
Why
do
we
say
that
until
we
get
that
person
that
we
think's
Gonna
be
that
one?
And
then
once
we
get
'em,
it's
never
the
same
You
want
'em
when
they
don't
want
you
Soon
as
they
do,
feelings
change
It's
not
a
contest
and
I
ain't
on
no
conquest
for
no
mate
I
wasn't
lookin'
when
I
stumbled
on
to
you,
musta
been
fate
But
so
much
is
at
stake,
what
the
fuck
does
it
take?
Let's
cut
to
the
chase
'fore
the
door
shuts
in
your
face
Promise
me
if
I
cave
in
and
break
and
leave
myself
open
That
I
won't
be
makin'
a
mistake,
‘cause
I'm
a—
I'm
a
space-bound
rocket
ship
and
your
heart's
the
Moon
And
I'm
aimin'
right
at
you,
right
at
you
250,000
miles
on
a
clear
night
in
June
And
I'm
aimin'
right
at
you
Right
at
you,
right
at
you
So,
after
a
year
and
six
months,
it's
no
longer
me
that
you
want
But
I
love
you
so
much
it
hurts,
never
mistreated
you
once
I
poured
my
heart
out
to
you,
let
down
my
guard,
swear
to
God
I
blow
my
brains
in
your
lap,
lay
here
and
die
in
your
arms
Drop
to
my
knees
and
I'm
pleadin',
I'm
tryna
stop
you
from
leavin'
You
won't
even
listen,
so
fuck
it,
I'm
tryna
stop
you
from
breathin'
I
put
both
hands
on
your
throat,
I
sit
on
top
of
you
squeezin'
'Til
I
snap
your
neck
like
a
Popsicle
stick,
ain't
no
possible
reason
I
can
think
of
to
let
you
walk
up
out
this
house
and
let
you
live
Tears
stream
down
both
of
my
cheeks
Now
I
let
you
go
and
just
give
And
'fore
I
put
that
gun
to
my
temple,
I
told
you
this
And
I
would've
done
anything
for
you
To
show
you
how
much
I
adored
you
But
it's
over
now,
it's
too
late
to
save
our
love
Just
promise
me
you'll
think
of
me
Every
time
you
look
up
in
the
sky
and
see
a
star,
‘cause
I'm
a—
I'm
a
space-bound
rocket
ship
and
your
heart's
the
Moon
And
I'm
aimin'
right
at
you,
right
at
you
250,000
miles
on
a
clear
night
in
June
And
I'm
so
lost
without
you
Without
you,
without
you
Yeah,
you
know,
technically
I'm
not
even
really
supposed
to
be
here
right
now
So
fuck
it,
might
as
well
make
the
most
of
it
(Amen,
Amen)
Yeah!
Ha
ha,
feels
good
Guess
I'm
lucky
Some
of
us
don't
get
a
second
chance
But
I
ain't
blowin'
this
one
Nah,
man,
ha
ha
Shit,
I
feel
like
I
can
do
anything
now

Potato's
baked,

the
veggies
on
my
plate
can
fly
My
filet
is
smokin'
weed—yeah,
faggot,
the
steaks
are
high
Shit,
I
ain't
even
suppose
to
be
here
by
the
grace
of
God
The
skin
of
my
teeth
and
the
hair
on
my
nuts,
I
skated
by
Now
y'all
are
on
thin
ice
with
ankle
weights,
I'd
hate
to
lie
How
fuckin'
irritated
are
you?
How
much
in
your
face
am
I?
It
ain't
shit
you
could
do
but
fear
it,
Proof
is
here
in
spirit
And
I'm
his
spittin'
image,
I
mirror
it
when
I
stand
near
it
Your
pussy
lyric,
I
"cunt"
hear
it
Who
forms
pyramids
and
raps
circles
around
square
lyricists?
Who?
Here's
a
clue
(Hey!)
He
came
to
the
ball
in
his
wife
beater,
lost
his
Nike
shoe
It's
in
your
ass,
(Hey!),
he's
in
your
ass
He's
all
up
in
your
psyche
too
(Hey!)
Now,
(Hey!)
what's
his
name?
(Cinderella
Man,
Cinderella
Man
Cinderella,
Cinderella
Man,
Cinderella
Man)
If
I
had
a
time
machine,
I'd
be
(Cinderella

Music

machine,
so

Too
late
for
the
other
side
Caught
in
a
chase,
25
to
life
Too
late
for
the
other
side
Caught
in
a
chase,
25
to
life
Too
late
(Yeah,
I
can't
keep
chasing
you
I'm
taking
my
life
back)
Caught
in
a
chase,
25
to
life
I
don't
think
she
understands
the
sacrifices
that
I've
made
Maybe
if
this
bitch
had
acted
right
I
woulda
stayed
But
I've
already
wasted
over
half
my
life,
I
woulda
laid
Down
and
died
for
you,
I
no
longer
cry
for
you,
no
more
pain
Bitch,
you
took
me
for
granted
Took
my
heart
and
ran
it
straight
into
the
planet
Into
the
dirt,
I
can
no
longer
stand
it,
now
my
respect,
I
demand
it
I'ma
take
control
of
this
relationship,
command
it
And
I'ma
be
the
boss
of
you
now,
goddamn
it
And
what
I
mean
is
that
I
will
no
longer
let
you
control
me
So
you
better
hear
me
out,
this
much
you
owe
me
I
gave
up
my
life
for
you,
totally
devoted
to
you
I
have
stayed
Faithful
all
the
way,
this
is
how
I
fuckin'
get
repaid?
Look
at
how
I
dress,
fuckin'
baggy
sweats,
go
to
work
a
mess
Always
in
a
rush
to
get
back
to
you,
I
ain't
heard
you
yet
Not
even
once
say
you
appreciate
me,
I
deserve
respect
I've
done
my
best
to
give
you
nothin'
less
than
perfectness
And
I
know
that
if
I
end
this
I'll
no
longer
have
nothin'
left
But
you
keep
treatin'
me
like
a
staircase:
it's
time
to
fuckin'
step
And
I
won't
be
comin'
back,
so
don't
hold
your
fuckin'
breath
You
know
what
you've
done,
no
need
to
go
in-depth
I
told
you
you'd
be
sorry
if
I
fuckin'
left
I
laughed
while
you
wept,
how's
it
feel
now?
Yeah,
funny,
ain't
it?
You
neglected
me
Did
me
a
favor,
though,
my
spirit
free
you've
set
But
a
special
place
for
you
in
my
heart
I
have
kept
It's
unfortunate,
but
it's…
Too
late
for
the
other
side
Caught
in
a
chase,
25
to
life
(Yeah,
can't
take
no
more)
Too
late
for
the
other
side
Caught
in
a
chase,
25
to
life
I
feel
like
when
I
bend
over
backwards
for
you,
all
you
do
is
laugh
‘Cause
that
ain't
good
enough
You
expect
me
to
fold
myself
in
half
'til
I
snap
Don't
think
I'm
loyal,
all
I
do
is
rap
How
can
I
moonlight
on
the
side?
I
have
no
life
outside
of
that
Don't
I
give
you
enough
of
my
time?
You
don't
think
so,
do
you?
Jealous
when
I
spend
time
with
the
girls
Why
I'm
married
to
you
still?
Man,
I
don't
know
But
tonight
I'm
serving
you
with
papers
I'm
divorcing
you
–
go
marry
someone
else
and
make
'em
famous!
And
take
away
their
freedom
like
you
did
to
me
Treat
'em
like
you
don't
need
'em
and
they
ain't
worthy
of
you
Feed
'em
the
same
shit
that
you
made
me
eat
I'm
moving
on,
forget
you
Oh,
now
I'm
special?
I
ain't
feel
special
when
I
was
with
you
All
I
ever
felt
was
this
helplessness,
imprisoned
by
a
selfish
bitch
Chew
me
up
and
spit
me
out,
I
fell
for
this
So
many
times
it's
ridiculous
And
still
I
stick
with
this,
I'm
sick
of
this
But
in
my
sickness
and
addiction,
you're
addictive
as
they
get
Evil
as
they
come,
vindictive
as
they
make
'em
My
friends
keep
askin'
me
why
I
can't
just
walk
away
from
I'm
addicted
to
the
pain,
the
stress,
the
drama
I'm
drawn
to
shit,
I
guess
I'm
a
Mess,
cursed
and
blessed,
but
this
time
I
Ain't
changin'
my
mind,
I'm
climbin'
out
this
abyss
You're
screamin'
as
I
walk
out
that
I'll
be
missed
But
when
you
spoke
of
people
Who
meant
the
most
to
you,
you
left
me
off
your
list
Fuck
you,
hip
hop!
I'm
leavin'
you
My
life
sentence
is
served,
bitch,
and
it's
just...
Too
late
for
the

Caught

(I'm
gone,
man)
Too

that,
baby?
Yeah,
I
feel
it
too,
damn
You
know,
I'm
so
glad
we
could
spend
this
time
together
You

you
thought
I
was,

I?

Oh,

Can't

Let

you
the
whole
story
of
Shady’s
origin
You'll
be
sorry
if
you
slam
my
Mercedes
door
again
Now,
it
all
started
with
my
father
I
must've
got
my
pimpin'
genes
from
him
The
way
he
left

I'm

Why

You

My

Lightyears

of
you
I
can
almost
taste
it
This
shit
makes
no
sense
to
me
What
does
it
all
mean?
I
can
almost

I

it
This
shit

What

I

I

Yeah,

This
might

the

chance
I
get
to
be
famous
(I
just
wanna
be

You
dream

places,
I
have
been
changing
faces
You
cannot
fill
these
shoes,
there
is
too
much
to
lose
Wake
up
behind
these
trenches,
you
run
around
defenseless
There
is
too
much
to
lose,
you
cannot
fill
these
shoes
I
just
wanna
be
famous,
but...
Be
careful
what
you
wish
for
I
stuck
my
dick
in
this
game
like
a
rapist
They
call
me
Slim
Roethlisberger
I
go
berserker
than
a
fed-up
post
office
worker
I
murk
her
with
a
Mossberg,
I'm
pissed
off,
get
murdered
Like
someone
took
a
ketchup
squirter,
squirted
a
frankfurter
For
a
gangster,
you
sure
did
shit
your
pants
When
you
saw
the
chainsaw
get
to
waving
like
a
terrible
towel
How
thangs
turn
around
when
his
fangs
come
out
Get
your
brains
blown
out,
that's
what
I
call
blowin'
your
mind
When
I
come
back,
like
nut
on
your
spine
I'm
a
thumb
tack
that
you
slept
on,
son
Now
here
I
come,
screaming
"Attack!"
like
I
just
stepped
on
one
Low
on
the
totem
'til
he
showed
'em
defiance,
giant
scrotum
He
don't
owe
them
bitches
shit,
his
britches,
he
outgrowed
'em
He's
so
out
cold,
he's
knocked
out
at
the
South
Pole
And
nobody
fucks
with
him,
rigor
mortis
and
post
mortem
He's
dyin'
of
boredom
Take
your
best
rhymes,
record
'em,
then
try
to
thwart
him
He'll
just
take
your
punch
lines
and
snort
'em
Shit-stained
drawers,
you
gon'
fuck
with
a
guy
Who
licks
the
blades
of
his
chainsaws
While
he
dips
'em
in
P.F.
Chang's
sauce?
Game's
up,
homie,
hang
it
up
like
some
crank
calls
You
think
I'm
backin'
down?
You
must
be
out
of
your
dang
skulls;
I'm
almost
famous
You
dream
of
trading
places,
I
have
been
changing
faces
You
cannot
fill
these
shoes,
there
is
too
much
to
lose
Wake
up
behind
these
trenches,
you
run
around
defenseless
There
is
too
much
to
lose,
you
cannot
fill
these
shoes
I
just
wanna
be
famous,
but...
Be
careful
what
you
wish
for
I'm
back
for
revenge,
I
lost
a
battle,
that
ain't
happenin'
again
I'm
at
your
throat
like
strep,
I
step,
strapped
with
a
pen
Metaphors
wrote
on
my
hand,
some
are
just
stored
in
my
memory
Some
I
wrote
on
a
napkin;
I
do
what
I
have
to
to
win
Pullin'
out
all
stops,
any
who
touch
a
mic
prior's
Not
even
Austin
Powers,
how
the
fuck
are
they
Mike
Myers?
And
tell
that
psycho
to
pass
the
torch
to
the
wacko
'Fore
I
take
a
shit
in
his
Jack-O-Lantern
and
smash
it
on
his
porch
Now
get
off
my
dick!
'Dick''s
too
short
of
a
word
for
my
dick
Get
off
my
antidisestablishmentarianism,
you
prick!
Don't
call
me
the
Champ,
call
me
the
Space
Shuttle
Destroyer
I
just
blew
up
the
Challenger;
matter
fact,
I
need
a
lawyer
I
just
laced
my
gloves
with
enough
plaster
to
make
a
cast
Beat
his
ass
naked
and
peed
in
his
corner
like
Verne
Troyer
Y'all
are
Eminem
backwards:
you're
Mini
Mes
See,
he's
in
a
whole
nother
weight
class
He's
slugs,
you're
BBs:
you're
bean-bag
bullets
You're
full
of
it,
you
were
dissin'
his
CD's
Laughed
at
Infinite,
now
he's
back
like
someone
pissed
in
his
Wheaties
No
peace
treaties,
he's
turned
into
a
beast
His
new
Slim
Shady
EP's
got
the
attention
of
the
mighty
D.R.E
He's
almost
famous
You
dream
of
trading
places,
I
have
been
changing
faces
You
cannot
fill
these
shoes,
there
is
too
much
to
lose
Wake
up
behind
these
trenches,
you
run
around
defenseless
There
is
too
much
to
lose,
you
cannot
fill
these
shoes
I
just
wanna
be
famous,
but...
Be
careful
what
you
wish
for
Now
there
he
goes
in
Dre's
studio,
cuppin'
his
balls
Screamin'
the
wood
off
the
panelin',
cussin'
the
paint
off
the
walls
Spewin'
his
hate
to
these
haters,
showin'
no
love
for
these
broads
He
ain't
givin'
them
shit,
he
says
he'll
pinch
a
penny
so
hard
He'll
leave
a
bruise
on
the
bronze
so
dark
you
can
see
the
mark
With
the
scars,
'til
Abraham
Lincoln
is
screamin'
out,
"Ahh!"
These
metaphors
and
similes
ain't
similar
to
them,
not
at
all
If
they
don't
like
it,
they
can
all
get
fucked
Instead
of
suckin'
him
off
They
can
go
get
a
belt
or
a
neck
tie
to
hang
themselves
by
Like
David
Carradine,
they
can
go
fuck
themselves
and
just
die
And
eat
shit
while
they
at
it,
he's
fuckin'
had
it
He's
mad
at
the
whole
world
So
go
to
hell
and
build
a
snowman,
girl
The
bullies
become
bullied,
and
pussies
get
pushed
Then
they
better
pull
me,
take
me
back
to
9th
grade
to
school
me
'Cause
I
ain't
lookin'
back,
only
forward,
this
whole
spot
blowin'
Who
coulda
known
he'd
grow
to
be
a
poet
and
not
know
it?
And
while
I'm
bein'
poetic,
let
me
get
it
stoic
and
raise
the
bar
Higher
than
my
opinion
of
these
women's
been
lowered
So
bear
witness
to
some
biblical
shit,
there's
a
cold
wind
blowin'
This
world
ain't
gonna
know
what
hit
it
He
did
it,
he
made
it,
he's
finally
famous
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn?
Well,
that's
all
right
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry?
Well,
that's
all
right
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
can't
tell
you
what
it
really
is,
I
can
only
tell
you
what
it
feels
like
And
right
now,
there's
a
steel
knife
in
my
windpipe
I
can't
breathe,
but
I
still
fight
while
I
can
fight
As
long
as
the
wrong
feels
right,
it's
like
I'm
in
flight
High
off
her
love,
drunk
from
her
hate
It's
like
I'm
huffin'
paint
and
I
love
her,
the
more
I
suffer,
I
suffocate
And
right
before
I'm
about
to
drown,
she
resuscitates
Me,
she
fuckin'
hates
me,
and
I
love
it
—
"Wait!
Where
you
going?"
—
"I'm
leaving
you!"
—
"No,
you
ain't!
Come
back!"
—
We're
runnin'
right
back,
here
we
go
again
It's
so
insane,
'cause
when
it's
goin'
good,
it's
goin'
great
I'm
Superman
with
the
wind
at
his
back,
she's
Lois
Lane
But
when
it's
bad,
it's
awful,
I
feel
so
ashamed
I
snapped,
"Who's
that
dude?",
I
don't
even
know
his
name
I
laid
hands
on
her,
I'll
never
stoop
so
low
again
I
guess
I
don't
know
my
own
strength
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn?
Well,
that's
all
right
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry?
Well,
that's
all
right
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
You
ever
love
somebody
so
much
you
can
barely
breathe
when
you're
with
'em?
You
meet,
and
neither
one
of
you
even
know
what
hit
'em
Got
that
warm
fuzzy
feelin',
yeah,
them
chills,
used
to
get
'em
Now
you're
gettin'
fuckin'
sick
of
lookin'
at
'em?
You
swore
you'd
never
hit
'em,
never
do
nothin'
to
hurt
'em
Now
you're
in
each
other's
face
spewin'
venom
in
your
words
when
you
spit
'em
You
push,
pull
each
other's
hair,
scratch,
claw,
bit
'em
Throw
'em
down,
pin
'em,
so
lost
in
the
moments
when
you're
in
'em
It's
the
rage
that
took
over,
it
controls
you
both
So
they
say
you're
best
to
go
your
separate
ways,
guess
that
they
don't
know
ya
'Cause
today,
that
was
yesterday,
yesterday
is
over
It's
a
different
day,
sound
like
broken
records
playin'
over
But
you
promised
her,
next
time
you'll
show
restraint
You
don't
get
another
chance,
life
is
no
Nintendo
game,
but
you
lied
again
Now
you
get
to
watch
her
leave
out
the
window
Guess
that's
why
they
call
it
window
pane
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn?
Well,
that's
all
right
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry?
Well,
that's
all
right
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
Now,
I
know
we
said
things,
did
things
that
we
didn't
mean
Then
we
fall
back
into
the
same
patterns,
same
routine
But
your
temper's
just
as
bad
as
mine
is,
you're
the
same
as
me
When
it
comes
to
love
you're
just
as
blinded,
baby,
please
Come
back,
it
wasn't
you,
baby,
it
was
me
Maybe
our
relationship
isn't
as
crazy
as
it
seems
Maybe
that's
what
happens
when
a
tornado
meets
a
volcano
All
I
know
is
I
love
you
too
much
to
walk
away
though
Come
inside,
pick
up
your
bags
off
the
sidewalk
Don't
you
hear
sincerity
in
my
voice
when
I
talk?
Told
you
this
is
my
fault,
look
me
in
the
eyeball
Next
time
I'm
pissed,
I'll
aim
my
fist
at
the
drywall
Next
time?
There
won't
be
no
next
time!
I
apologize,
even
though
I
know
it's
lies
I'm
tired
of
the
games,
I
just
want
her
back,
I
know
I'm
a
liar
If
she
ever
tries
to
fuckin'
leave
again,
I'ma
tie
her
To
the
bed
and
set
this
house
on
fire,
just
gonna
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn?
Well,
that's
all
right
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry?
Well,
that's
all
right
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
The
days
are
cold,
livin'
without
you
The
nights
are
long,
I'm
growin'
older
I
miss
the
days
of
old,
thinkin'
about
you
You
may
be
gone,
but
you're
never
over
If
Proof
could
see
me
now,
I
know
he'd
be
proud
Somewhere
in
me
deep
down,
there's
something
in
me
he
found
That
made
him
believe
in
me,
now
no
one
can
beat
me
now
You
try,
it'll
be
them
doors
on
Dre's
Phantom,
believe
me,
clowns
That
means
"suicide,"
homie,
you'll
never
throw
me
Off
of
this
course,
blow
me!
Bitch,
I
do
this
all
for
the
sport
only
But
I
want
it
all,
I'm
not
just
talkin'
awards,
homie
And
the
ball's
in
my
court
and
it's
lonely
On
top
of
the
world,
when
you're
the
only
one
With
the
balls
in
your
shorts
To
leave
their
jaws
on
the
floors
with
no
remorse
'Member
that
when
they
get
to
doggin'
you
boy,
homie
So
y'all
can
just
get
to
bloggin'
about
bologna
I'm
not
gonna
stop,
the
saga
continues,
no
stoppin'
the
force,
Obi
I'm
moppin'
the
floors
with
'em,
I
keep
tryna
pass
it,
but
they
keep
on
Droppin'
the
torch
and
it
won't
be
long
'til
this
sport
is
O-V-
-E-R,
just
Blaze
and
me,
we
are
knockin'
on
doors
and
no,
we
Ain't
pumpkins
on
Halloween,
but
we'll
show
up
on
your
porch,
so
be
Careful
what
you
say,
there
ain't
no
punks
over
here,
so
follow
me
Through
the
fog
like
I'm
S-N-double-O-P,
let
me
guide
you
through
the
smoke,
G
If
only
I
wasn't
travelin'
down
this
road
by
my
lonely
No
one
who
knew
me
like
you
will
ever
know
me
I
don't
think
you
understand
how
much
you
meant
to
me
The
days
are
cold,
livin'
without
you
The
nights
are
long,
I'm
growin'
older
I
miss
the
days
of
old,
thinkin'
about
you
You
may
be
gone,
but
you're
never
over
And
it
don't
stop,
oh-oh
And
it
don't
quit,
oh-oh
And
it
don't
stop,
oh-oh
And
it
don't
quit,
oh-oh
And
I
miss
you,
oh-oh
I
just
miss
you,
oh-oh
I
just
miss
you,
oh-oh
Homie,
I'll
never
forget
you,
no
For
you,
I
wanna
write
the
sickest
rhyme
of
my
life
So
sick
it'll
blow
up
the
mic,
it'll
put
the
"dyna"
in
"mite"
Yeah,
it'll
make
the
dopest
MC
wanna
jump
off
a
bridge
and
shit
himself
Tap
dancin'
all
over
the
beat,
it'll
jump
off
the
page
and
spit
itself
Guess
that
the
best
thing
I
can
do
right
now,
Doody,
for
you
is
to
rep
So
I'm
gonna
fuck
'til
I
die,
yeah,
I'ma
do
it
to
death
And
instead
of
mournin'
your
death,
I'd
rather
celebrate
your
life
Elevate
to
new
heights,
step
on
the
gas
and
accelerate,
I'ma
need
two
mics
'Cause
the
way
that
I'm
feelin'
tonight,
everything
I
can
just
do
right
There's
nothin'
that
I
can
do
wrong,
I'm
too
strong
and
I'm
just
too
hype
Just
finish
the
rhyme
and
I
bust
it,
excuse
the
corny
metaphor
But
they'll
never
catch
up
to
all
this
energy
that
I've
mustered
So
God,
just
help
me
out
while
I
fight
through
this
grievin'
process
Tryna
process
this
loss
is
makin'
me
nauseous
But
this
depression
ain't
takin'
me
hostage,
I've
been
patiently
watchin'
This
game,
pacin'
these
hallways,
you
had
faith
in
me
always
Proof,
you
knew
I'd
come
out
of
this
slump,
rise
from
these
ashes
Come
right
back
on
their
asses
and
go
Mike
Tyson
on
these
bastards
And
I'ma
show
'em,
blow
'em
out
the
water,
slaughter
'em,
homes
I'ma
own
so
many
belts,
only
place
they
can
hit
me
is
below
'em
Homie,
I
know
I'm
never
gonna
be
the
same
without
you
I
never
woulda
came
in
this
game,
I'm
goin'
insane
without
you
Matter
fact,
it
was
just
the
other
night
had
another
dream
about
you
You
told
me
to
get
up,
I
got
up,
I
spread
my
wings
and
I
flew
You
gave
me
a
reason
to
fight,
I
was
on
my
way
to
see
you
You
told
me,
"Naw,
Doody,
you're
not!";
layin'
on
that
table,
I
knew
I
was
gonna
make
it;
soon
as
you
said,
"Think
of
Hailie"
I
knew
There
wasn't
no
way
that
I
was
ever
gonna
leave
them
babies;
and
Proof
Not
many
are
lucky
enough
to
have
a
guardian
angel
like
you
Lord,
I'm
so
thankful,
please
don't
think
that
I
don't
feel
grateful,
I
do
Just
grant
me
the
strength
that
I
need
for
one
more
day
to
get
through
So,
homie,
this
is
your
song,
I
dedicate
this
to
you
I
love
you,
Doody
The
days
are
cold,
livin'
without
you
The
nights
are
long,
I'm
growin'
older
I
miss
the
days
of
old,
thinkin'
about
you
You
may
be
gone,
but
you're
never
over
And
it
don't
stop,
oh-oh
And
it
don't
quit,
oh-oh
And
it
don't
stop,
oh-oh
And
it
don't
quit,
oh-oh
And
I
miss
you,
oh-oh
I
just
miss
you,
oh-oh
I
just
miss
you,
oh-oh
Homie,
I'll
never
forget
you,
no
Nah,
man—not
quite
finished
yet
Haha,
woo!
Girl,
I
think
you
just
might've
tried
To
pull
a
motherfuckin’
fast
one,
I’m
mad
You
just
hurt
my
goddamn
feeling
and
that
was
the
last
one
I
had
Does
this
look
like
an
arcade?
Tryna
play
games?
See
this
saw
blade?
See
this
silhouette
of
a
stalker
in
your
walkway?
Better
cooperate
or
get
sauteed
And
rotisseried
while
you’re
hog-tied
MC’s
get
so
quiet
You
can
hear
a
motherfuckin'
dog
whistle
when
I
walk
by
Colt
Seavers
on
a
mule,
stuntin'
on
that
ass
like
the
fuckin’
Fall
Guy
I
don’t
gas
my
Mercedes
after
midnight,
I
treat
it
like
a
Mogwai
'Cause
it
will
turn
into
a
Gremlin
And
run
over
kids,
women,
and
men—Vrinn-Vrinn!
Motor
so
big,
you
can
fit
a
midget
in
his
engine
Bitch,
give
me
them
digits,
why
you
cringin’?
Not
by
the
hair
on
my
chinny-chin-chin
Will
I
spend-spend
even
ten
cents
on
you,
since
when
Do
you
think
it’s
gonna
cost
me
a
pretty
penny?
Shit,
if
I
think
a
penny’s
pretty
Just
imagine
how
beautiful
a
quarter
is
to
me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch
an
Eskimo
by
his
toe
while
he’s
tryna
roll
a
snowball
But
don’t
make
him
lose
his
cool
If
he
hollers,
better
let
him
go,
y’all
'Cause
"You
don't
own
me"
Now
here
we
go,
go,
go
Get
up,
baby,
get
a
move
on
like
a
U-Haul
You
can
rack
your
brain
like
pool
balls
You
won't
ever
think
of
this
shit—yeah,
honey,
you
called?
Well,
here
I
come,
Havoc
on
the
beat,
I
wreak
it
Evil—I
see,
hear,
and
speak
it
Lady,
put
your
money
on
Shady,
fuck
that
other
weak
shit
Put
your
eggs
in
the
same
basket
You
can
count
every
motherfuckin’
chicken
'fore
it
hatches
'Cause
you
can
bet
your
ass
that
we
gonna
get
it
crackin’
Like
the
Kraken
and
Titans
when
they're
clashin'
Get
your
brains
bashed
in
So
bad,
you
will
have
Kurt
Cobain
askin’
To
autograph
a
bloodstained
napkin
Unfashionable,
and
'bout
as
rational
as
a
rash
on
a
fag’s
asshole
Now
let’s
take
that
line,
run
it
up
the
flagpole
With
Elton,
see
if
he’s
cool
with
it
Don’t
stand
there
and
look
stupid
at
Me,
bitch,
I
ain’t
in
the
mood
for
this
shit
Get
my
dick,
Google
it
'til
it
pops
up
Y’all
are
so
motherfuckin’
full
of
shit
that
you're
stopped
up
Me,
I’m
always
shittin'
diarrhea
of
the
mouth
'Til
your
speakers
crap
out
Pfft,
huh,
what?
Girl,
you
got
a
hot
butt
Like
a
lit
cigarette
(chig-chigga-ret-ret)
But
you
won’t
get
a
hot
fudge
sundae
from
me
So
do
not
strut
my
way,
slut,
because—
"You
don't
own
me"
Now
here
we
go,
go,
go
And
now
that
I
got
your
panties
in
a
bunch
And
your
bowels
in
an
uproar
I'ma
show
you
why
I
came,
so
you
stop
askin'
me
what
the
fuck
for
Now
look
you
little
slut,
cunt,
whore,
I
know
you
want
more
Bitch,
it’s
time
to
put
the
math
back
into
Mathers
'Cause
I’m
a
fuckin’
problem—run,
boy!
Every
flow,
got
it
mastered
So
every
last
word
that
you
fuckin’
fags
heard
Comes
straight
from
the
fish's
ass
Yeah,
in
other
words,
I’m
a
bass-turd
Lookin'
at
me
like
I
killed
Kenny,
gas
in
the
tank,
yeah,
still
plenty
No
morals
are
instilled
in
me,
so
remorse,
I
really
don’t
feel
any
Eat
your
heart
out,
Hannibal,
understandable
why
you're
jealous
Fuck
an
animal,
I
got
cannibal
magnetism
Can't
resist
him
now—can
you,
ho?
“Shady,
I
don’t
understand
your
flow”
Understand
my
flow?
Bitch,
I
flow
like
Troy
Polamalu’s
hair,
boy
Don’t
you
dare
try
to
follow
or
compare,
boy
I’m
raw,
you
ain’t
even
medium-rare
Stay
the
fuck
outta
my
hair,
boy
You
can
look,
you
can
stare,
and
point
But
you
can’t
touch,
I’m
too
clairvoyant
I
don’t
get
it,
man,
is
there
a
void?
All
this
weak
shit,
what
am
I,
steroids?
Well,
bitch,
I’m
back
with
some
shit
for
that
ass
And
your
trunk,
elephant
hemorrhoids
And
remember,
boys—
"You
don't
own
me"
Now
here
we
go,
go,
go
Thank
you
for
coming
out
I
hope
you
enjoyed
the
show
Until
next
time;
ha-ha
Peace
Aw,
man,
yeah
You
ever
be
in
the
club,
man,
you
get
in
a
fight
And
people
that
you
don't
even
know
jump
in?
You
feel
like
you
wanna
hit
somethin'
Your
fist
clenches,
you're
pissed
You
just
wanna
get
someone
with
shit,
jump
on
this
You're
'bout
to
get
your
shit
pushed
in,
I'm
just
inches
away
From
splittin'
your
shit
wide
open,
no
stitches
can
save
You'll
die
with
your
eyes
open,
you
hope
this
isn't
the
way
You
end
up
going
out,
but
I
guess
it
just
is,
I'm
afraid
Razors,
scissors
and
blades
make
Jason
say,
"Isn't
this
great?"
On-lookers
participate
in
this
ass-kicking
debate
That's
startin'
to
take
place
in
the
middle
of
the
street
Little
did
you
know
there'd
be
an
all-out
brawl
Soon
as
you
heard
this
beat
Emergency
personnel
rush
to
the
murder
scene
But
it's
too
late,
it's
absolute
pandemonium
Whisked
away
in
an
ambulance
is
your
fate
Nothing
nobody
told
you
when
you
left
the
house
today
Could've
made
you
anticipate
such
an
ass-whipping,
okay
'Til
the
anger
dissipates
You'll
get
punched
in
the
face,
reciprocate,
come
on
So
what
the
deal,
ridaz?
Would
you
excuse
me
while
I
feel
my
nuts?
My
balls
are
feeling
a
mighty
big
now
I
might
just
have
to
dig
down
and
pull
'em
through
my
britches
I
said,
so
what
the
deal,
ridaz?
Would
you
excuse
me
while
I
feel
my
nuts?
My
balls
are
feeling
a
mighty
big
now
I
might
just
have
to
dig
down
and
pull
'em
through
my
britches
You
step
in
the
place
with
enough
misplaced
anger
to
catch
a
case
Anxious
to
get
in
some
shit,
got
your
gangstas
all
with
your
ladies
You
better
go
get
your
mace
'cause
Shady
said
so
You
may
wanna
pick
up
the
radio
and
bang
it
against
your
face
That's
how
fuckin'
rowdy
you
feel,
now
do
you
still
wanna
grill?
If
you
don't
wanna
get
the
shit
beat
out
of
you,
chill
'Cause
if
you
doubt
me,
you
will
Yeah,
got
me
a
pill,
found
me
a
thrill
I
got
a
couple
of
drinks
here,
and
I'm
bound
to
refill
Girl,
howdy,
how
do
you
feel,
ma?
This
cocksucker
did
not
spill
my
drink,
oh,
hell
nah
He
must
be
trying
to
kill
my
buzz
I
will
not
budge,
so
what
the
deal,
ridaz?
Now
here
they
all
come
And
they
got
your
back
in,
like,
two
seconds
flat
And
that's
probably
a
record,
yeah,
you
wasn't
expecting
that
'Cause
they
want
in
on
the
act,
there's
a
Cognac
bottle
We
snuck
it
in
'cause
the
beer
That
they
was
serving
here
was
only
tap
I'm
bitin',
I
fight
dirty,
you
might
get
kicked
in
the
nuts
You're
frightened
like,
"This
guy
might
hurt
me"
You're
quite
certain
he's
nuts,
I've
hit
myself
in
the
face
harder
Play
smarter,
you
may
start
her
over,
you
need
a
chainsaw
to
Dig
your
way
out
or
go
powder
your
nose,
pussy
The
louder
you
yell,
the
harder
I
slap
the
shit
outta
you
hoes
You
set
it
off,
faggot,
so
now
how
do
you
'spose
we
settle
it?
Hit
me
in
the
nose
and
we'll
see
how
it
goes
So
what
the
deal,
ridaz?
Would
you
excuse
me
while
I
feel
my
nuts?
My
balls
are
feeling
a
mighty
big
now
I
might
just
have
to
dig
down
and
pull
'em
through
my
britches
I
said,
so
what
the
deal,
ridaz?
Would
you
excuse
me
while
I
feel
my
nuts?
My
balls
are
feeling
a
mighty
big
now
I
might
just
have
to
dig
down
and
pull
'em
through
my
britches
It's
sheer
hustle,
I
bob,
weave,
deflate
your
beer
muscles
We're
tusslin',
the
crowd's
starting
to
cheer
us
and
Adrenaline's
rushin'
through
us
just
like
a
geyser
gushin'
Too
much
Budweiser
in
my
blood
I'm
stranglin'
your
windpipe
for
nothing
My
signature's
ligature
marks,
look
at
you
all
Big
with
your
remarks
'til
I
swing
an
icepick
at
your
heart
At
least
that's
what
it
feels
like
when
I
pick
you
apart
And
dig
at
ya,
and
break
you
down
like
the
bitch
that
you
are
The
predicament
starts
when
I
throw
a
brick
at
your
car
The
pain
inflicted
upon
you
is
so
sick,
it's
bizarre
Shit,
this
is
almost
ridiculous,
addictive
as
far
As
havin'
me
wanna
rip
out
your
fricking
ligaments,
ah
You
hit
like
a
bitch,
you
scratch
me
with
your
nails
for
that
You
catch
an
open
hand
slap
like
a
female
like
bap
In
fact,
I'll
have
the
crowd
smackin'
you

I

Would

Couple

So

Damn

You

It's

Break

Now

your
favorite
pain

Who

spitting
the
same
flames
as

I'm
Kanye
when
he
crashed
In
other
words
I
got
the
hood
on
smash
like
I
stepped
on
the
gas
Destroyed
the
front
end
Deployed
the
damn
airbags
from
the
dash
Went
through
'em
and
laughed
Came
back
an
hour
after
the
accident
And
bit
a
goddamn
Jawbreaker
in
half!
So
stop
faking
the
funk
and
start
shaking
your
ass
Slaughterhouse
in
the
house
with
the
Caucasian
of
rap
And
Just
Blaze

Slut,

The

and

upside-down
Like

69ing
It's

FUCK
YO'
COUCH

You're

with
your
middle
finger
up
While
I'm
over
here
shoving
my
dick
in
a
hole
in
the
mud
My
bitch
know
I'm
perfectly
fit
for
murder
Because
I
murdered
her,
so
you
can
call
me
Nickel
to
O.J.

I
got
a
Posse

Blow

It's
a

Get

like
I'm
Middle

FIRE,
nobody
touching
that
Good
day
and
good
night,
Ortiz,
yo,
where
the
FUCK
you
at?
I'm
right
here
in
my
Nike
Airs,
Buzz
Light-years
Ahead
of
my
mic
peers,
quite
scary
to
look
at
a
nightmare
Where
my
book
at?
I
write
fear
in
the
heart
of
you
tight
squares
I
harbor
the
art
of
my
nice
wear
It's
type
weird
'cause
that
made
me
hotter
than
my
dear
Uncle
Al's
breath
after
polishing
off
his
ninth
beer
Homie
chill,
listen,
I
swear
I'm
God,
I
give
tracks
a
Holy-feel,
and
they
bite
ears
I'm
right
here,
why
wouldn't
I
be?
Just
waiting
to
be
hooked
to
IV
as
Mumm-Ra's
Well,
when
you
look
at
my
pee
And
this
joint
no
exception,
so
just
point
a
direction
And
record
the
pig's
oink
when
I
rip
his
intestine
This
isn't
just
an
infection
This
won't
go
away
with
penicillin
injections
Millions
of
questions
arose
After
they
did
an
inspection,
what
I
exhibit
Seems
to
be
non-contagious
yet
anybody
can
get
it
Aw
shiddit,
I
did
it
again,
when
I
liddift
this
pen
I
emitted
this
phlegm,
this
time
it's
alongside
Edimminem
So

a
friend

Jump

Get

And

A

and
my

I
laugh
when
you

the

I'll

Man,

Then

Where's
Jumpoff
Joe
Beezy?
"Morning,
Marshall."
"Morning,
doc."
"So
we're
discharging
you
today,
how
are
you
feeling?"
"Ah,
anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well,
anxious
to
get
home,
anxious
to
get
back
into
the
world.
Nervous."
"Nervous?
C'mon,
Marshall,
you're
a
big
boy
now
You're
sounding
like
a
bit
of
a
baby,
you
can
do
this
You
found
a
sponsor
yet?"
"Um,
not
yet.
But
I
mean,
when
I
get
back..."
"Well,
if
you
find
one,
you
find
one.
If
you
don't,
you
don't."
"Well,
yeah,
I
mean
I
gotta
start
going
to
meetings
first
and...
Wait,
what?"
"Well,
I
mean
you
don't
absolutely
have
to
go
to
meetings
I
mean
it's
not
like...
a
requirement
If
they
fit
into
your
schedule,
I
know
you're
a
busy
person."
"Well,
yeah,
but
I
thought
sobriety
was
the
most
important
thing?"
"So
what
else
are
you
thinking?"
"Um,
well,
I
know
I
gotta
start
practicing
the
steps,
and
I
mean,
learn
'em,
and
start
being
able
to
apply
'em."
"The
steps?"
"Yeah,
the
steps."
"There's
a
lot
of
them,
aren't
there?"
"Well,
twelve,
but–"
"Christ,
I
don't
even
know
them
all."
"Really?"
"Anything
else?"
"Um,
well,
I
mean
the
only
other
question
I
have
is,
like
What
do
I
do
if
I
find
myself
in
a
situation
where
Maybe
somebody
is
drinking
around
me
or
something
like
that
And
I
get
tempted
to—"
"Take
a
drink."
"What?"
"Take
a
drink,
and
y'know,
take
the
edge
off."
"Take
the
edge
off?
Man,
if
I
have
a
drink
I
already
know
what
that's
gonna
lead
me
to."
"What,
you
mean
these?"
*shakes
pills*
"No,
what
the
fuck?!"
"Marshall,
what's
the
matter,
darling?
Having
some
doubts,
are
we?
Marshall,
you
can't
leave
me,
you'll
never
leave
me,
Marshall
We'll
always
be
together,
Marshall.
Marshall?
Marshall!!
"Oh
no,
no,
no!
Come
on,
man!
Oh,
fuck
you,
man!
No,
no,
no,
NO!"
*Alarm
beeps*
"Oh,
shit!"
There
is
no
escaping
(Yo)
There's
no
place
to
hide
(Ayo)
You
scream,
"Someone
save
me!"
(Yo)
But
they
don't
pay
no
mind
(Ayo)
Goodnight,
goodbye!
You're
walkin'
down
a
horror
corridor
It's
almost
four
in
the
mornin'
and
you're
in
a
Nightmare,
it's
horrible,
right
there's
the
coroner
Waiting
for
ya
to
turn
the
corner
so
he
can
corner
ya
You're
a
goner,
he's
onto
ya
Out
the
corner
of
his
cornea,
he
just
saw
ya
run
All
you
want
is
to
rest
'cause
you
can't
run
anymore,
you're
done
All
he
wants
is
to
kill
you
in
front
of
an
audience
While
everybody
is
watching
in
the
party,
applauding
it
Here
I
sit,
while
I'm
caught
up
in
deep
thought
again
Contemplating
my
next
plot
again
Swallowin'
a
Klonopin
while
I'm
noddin'
in
and
out
on
the
ottoman
At
the
Ramada
Inn,
holding
onto
the
pill
bottle,
then
Lick
my
finger
and
swirl
it
'round
the
bottom
And
make
sure
I
got
all
of
it
Wake
up
naked
at
McDonald's
with
Blood
all
over
me,
dead
bodies
behind
the
counter,
shit
Guess
I
must've
just
blacked
out
again—not
again!
It's
3
a.m.
in
the
mornin'
Put
my
key
in
the
door
and
Bodies
layin'
all
over
the
floor
and
I
don't
remember
how
they
got
there
But
I
guess
I
must've
killed
'em,
killed
'em
I
said,

Put

'em,

'em
Sitting
nude
in
my
living
room,
it's
almost
noon
I
wonder
what's
on
the
tube,
maybe
they'll
show
some
boobs
Surfing
every
channel
until
I
find
Hannah
Montana
then
I
reach
for
the
aloe

lanolin,
bust
all
over
the
wall
panellin'
Dismantlin'
every
candle
on
top
of
the
fireplace
mantel
and
Grab
my
flannel
and
my
bandana,
then
Kiss
the
naked
mannequin

again
You
can
see
him
standin'
in
my
front
window
if
you
look
in
I'm
just
a
hooligan
who's
used
to
using
hallucinogens
Causin'
illusions
again,
brain
contusions
again
Cutting
and
bruising
the
skin,
razors,
scissors,
and
pins
Jesus,
when
does
it
end?
Phases
that
I
go
through
Dazed
and
I'm
so
confused
Days
that
I
don't
know
who
gave
these
molecules
to
Me,
what
am
I
gon'
do?
Hey,
the
prodigal
son,
the
diabolical
one
Very
methodical
when
I
slaughter
them
It's

I
cut
and
I
slash,
slice
and
gash,
last
night
was
a
blast
I
can't
quite
remember
when
I
had
that
Much
fun
off
a
half-pint
of
the
Jack,
my
last
Vic
and-a-half
A

up
Kim
Kardashian's
ass
I
remember
the
first
time
I
dismembered
a
family
member
December,
I
think
it
was,
I
was
having
drinks
with
my
cousin
I
wrapped
him
in
Christmas
lights
Pushed
him
into
the
stinkin'
tub,
cut
him
up
into
pieces
And
just
when
I
went
to
drink
his
blood
I
thought,
"I
oughta
drink
his
bathwater,
that
oughta
be
fun"
That's
when
my
days
of
serial
murder
manslaughter
begun
The
sight
of
blood
excites
me,
that
might
be
an
artery,
son
Your
blood-curdling
screams
just
don't
seem
to
bother
me
none
It's
3
a.m.
and
here
I
come,
so
you
should
probably
run
A
secret
passageway
around
here,
man,
there's
got
to
be
one
Oh
no,
there's
probably
none
He
can
scream
all
that
he
wants,
top
of
his
lungs
But
ain't
no
stopping
me
from
chopping
him
up-up,
'cause…
It's
3
a.m.
in
the
mornin'
Put
my
key
in
the
door
and
Bodies
layin'
all
over
the
floor
and
I
don't
remember
how
they
got
there
But
I
guess
I
must've
killed
'em,
killed
'em
I
said,
it's
3
a.m.
in
the
mornin'
Put
my
key
in
the
door
and
Bodies
layin'
all
over
the
floor
and
I
don't
remember

Yo,

Alright,

Here
we
go
now
My
mom
loved
Valium
and
lots
of
drugs
That's
why
I
am
like
I
am
'cause
I'm
like
her
Because
my
mom
loved
Valium
and
lots
of
drugs
That's
why
I'm
on
what
I'm
on
'cause
I'm
my
mom
My
mom,
my
mom,
I
know
you're
probably
tired
Of
hearin'
'bout
my
mom,
oh-ho,
whoa-ho
But
this
is
just
a
story
of
when
I
was
just
a
shorty
And
how
I
became
hooked
on
Va-aliu-um
Valium
was
in
everything,
food
that
I
ate
The
water
that
I
drank,
fuckin'
peas
in
my
plate
She
sprinkled
just
enough
of
it
to
season
my
steak
So
every
day
I'd
have
at
least
three
stomachaches
Now
tell
me,
what
kind
of
mother
would
want
to
see
her
Son
grow
up
to
be
an
undera-fuckin'-chiever?
My
teacher
didn't
think
I
was
gonna
be
nothin'
either
"What
the
fuck
you
stickin'
gum
up
under
the
fuckin'
seat
for?"
"Mrs.
Mathers,
your
son
has
been
huffin'
ether
Either
that
or
the
motherfucker's
been
puffin'
reefer"
But
all
this
huffin'
and
puffin'
wasn't
what
it
was
either
It
was
neither,
I
was
buzzin'
but
it
wasn't
what
she
thought
Pee
in
a
teacup?
Bitch,
you
ain't
my
keeper,
I'm
sleepin'
What
the
fuck
you
keep
on
fuckin'
with
me
for?
Slut,
you
need
to
leave
me
the
fuck
alone,
I
ain't
playin'
Go
find
you
a
white
crayon
and
color
a
fuckin'
zebra
My
mom
loved
Valium
and
lots
of
drugs
That's
why
I
am
like
I
am
'cause
I'm
like
her
Because
my
mom
loved
Valium
and
lots

That's
why
I'm
on
what
I'm
on
'cause
I'm
my
mom
Wait
a
minute,
this
ain't
dinner,
this
is
paint
thinner
"You
ate
it
yesterday,
I
ain't
hear
no
complaints,
did
I?
Now
here's
a
plate
full
of
painkillers,
now
just
wait
'Til
I
crush
the
Valium
and
put
it
in
your
potatoes
You
little
motherfucker,
I'll
make
you
sit
there
and
make
That
retarded
fuckin'
face
without
even
tastin'
it
You
better
lick
the
fuckin'
plate,
you
ain't
wastin'
it
Put
your
face
in
it
'fore
I
throw
you
in
the
basement
again
And
I
ain't
givin'
in,
you're
gonna
just
sit
there
In
one
fuckin'
place,
finnickin'
'til
next
Thanksgiving
And
if
you
still
ain't
finished
it
I'll
use
the
same
shit
again
Then
when
I
make
spinach
dip
it'll
be
placed
in
the
shit
You
little
shit,
wanna
sit
there
and
play
innocent?
A
rack
fell
and
hit
me
in
K-Mart
and
they
witnessed
it
Child
support,
your
father,
he
ain't
sent
the
shit
And
so
what
if
he
did?
It's
none
of
your
dang
business,
kid"
My
mom
There's
no
one
else
quite
like
my
mom
I
know
I
should
let
bygones
be
bygones
But
she's
the
reason
why
I
am
high
on
what
I'm
high
on
'Cause
my
mom
loved
Valium
and
lots
of
drugs
That's
why
I
am
like
I
am
'cause
I'm
like
her
Because
my
mom
loved
Valium
and
lots

That's
why
I'm
on
what
I'm
on
'cause
I'm
my
mom
My
mom
loved
Valium,
now
all
I
am
Is
a
party
animal,
I
am
what
I
am
But
I'm
strong
to
the
finish
with
me
Valium
spinach
But
my
buzz
only
lasts
about
two
minutes
But
I
don't
wanna
swallow
it
without
chewin'
it
I
can't
even
write
a
rhyme
without
you
in
it
My
Valium,
my
Vaaaaaa-liummmm,
ohh
Man,
I
never
thought
that
I
could
ever
be
A
drug
addict,
naw,
fuck
that,
I
can't
have
it
happen
to
me
But
that's
actually
what
has
ended
up
happenin'
A
tragedy,
the
fuckin'
past
ended
up
catchin'
me
And
it's
probably
where
I
got
acquainted
with
the
taste,
ain't
it?
Pharmaceuticals
are
the
bomb,
Mom,
beautiful
She
killed
the
fuckin'
dog
with
the
medicine
she
done
fed
it
Feed
it
a
fuckin'
aspirin
and
say
that
it
has
a
headache
"Here,
want
a
snack?
You
hungry,
you
fuckin'
brat?
Look
at
that,
it's
a
Xanax,
take
it
and
take
a
nap,
eat
it"
But
I
don't
need
it
—
"Well
fuck
it
then,
break
it
up
Take
a
little
piece
and
beat
it
before
you
wake
Nathan
up"
Alright
Ma,
you
win,
I
don't
feel
like
arguin'
I'll
do
it,
pop
it,
gobble
it
and
start
wobblin'
Stumble,
hobble,
tumble,
slip,
trip,
then
I
fall
in
bed
With
a
bottle
of
meds
and
a
Heath
Ledger
bobblehead
My

Dr.
Dre,
2010
Hey,
this
shit
is
hella
hard,
homie
Yo,
take
us
on
outta
here
Woo!
I
was
born
with
a
dick
in
my
brain,
yeah,
fucked
in
the
head
My
stepfather
said
that
I
sucked
in
the
bed
'Til
one
night
he
snuck
in
and
said
"We're
going
out
back,
I
want
my
dick
sucked
in
the
shed"
Can't
we
just
play
with
Teddy
Ruxpin
instead?
"After
I
fuck
you
in
the
butt,
get
some
head
Bust
a
nut,
get
some
rest,"
the
next
day
my
mother
said
"I
don't
know
what
the
fuck's
up
with
this
kid
The
bastard
won't
even
eat
nothing
he's
fed
He
just
hung
himself
in
the
bedroom,
he's
dead"
"Debbie,
don't
let
that
fucker
get
you
upset
Go
in
there,
stick
a
fuckin'
cigarette
to
his
neck
I'll
bet
you
he's
fakin'
it,
I'll
bet
you,
I
bet
He
probably
just
wants
to
see
how
upset
you
would
get
I'll
go
handle
this,
of
course
unless
you
object"
"Aw,
go
fuck
his
brains
out
if
any's
left
in
his
head"
If
you
could
count
the
skeletons
in
my
closet
Under
my
bed
and
up
under
my
faucet
Then
you
would
know
I've
completely
lost

No,

"Did

get
him?"
Naw,
fucker
tried
to
bite
my
face
off
I
just
got
fuckin'
chased
off
with
a
chainsaw
Then
he
took
the
chainsaw,
bit
the
fuckin'
blades
off
Ate
the
blades,
stuck
a
baseball
in
a
slingshot
Then
he
aimed
at
his
own
face,
let
the
thing
pop
Took
his
eye
out,
picked
it
up
and
played
ping
pong
Then
he
played
ping
pong
with
his
own
ding-dong
That
motherfucker's
got
nuts
like
King
Kong
Then
he
set
the
lawnmower
out
on
the
dang
lawn
And
he
laid
all
up
underneath
it
with
the
thing
on
Then
he
took
his
pants,
he
took
every
fuckin'
thing
off
Everything
except
his
tank
top
and
his
training
bra
Ain't
he
raw?
Yeah,

Shady,

Man

yours?
Say

Sing

Burp,

Can

I'm
saying,

Can

I

"Marshall,

about
your
well-being"
No,

no
help
peeing
I'm
a
big

can
do

by
myself,

I
only
get
naked
when
the
babysitter
tells
me
She
showed
me
a
movie
like
Nightmare
on
Elm
Street
But
it
was
X
and
they
called
it
"Pubic
Hair
on
Chelsea"
"Well,
this
is
called
'Ass
Rape'
and
we're
shooting
the
jail
scene"

Okay,

How

Locked

Mariah's
wine
cellar,

Was
bread,
wine,
more
bread,
wine
and
Captain
Crunch
Red
wine
for
breakfast
and
for
brunch
And
to
soak
it
up,
an
in-between
snack,
crackers
to
munch
Mariah,
what
ever
happened
to
us?
Why
did
we
have
to
break
up?
All
I
asked
for
was
a
glass
of
punch
You

I
never
really
asked
for
much
I
can't

I'm
going
to

the

and
thread
from
the

And

'em

Hello
(Hello)
Allow
me
to

myself
(myself)
My
name
is
Shady
It's
so
nice
to
meet
you
(so

It's

I'm

(so

My

Shady
I
never

you
(never

you)
Yeah
You
see
that
chick
in
the
gym,
checking
me
out?
Any
second
I'm
'bout
to
stick
her
neck
in
my
mouth
I
lose
a
pill
and
I'm
recklessly
wreckin'
the
house
That
was
supposed
to
be
breakfast,
where
the
heck
is
it
now?
There's
the
necklace
I
lost,
right
next
to
Stephanie's
blouse
Man,
I
should
check
to
see
if
my
mom
left
any
out
Nope,
guess
I'll
re-route
Maybe
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
couch
Oh,
jackpot,
yeah,
open
sesame
mouth
Down
the
hatch,
and
the
feeling
you
can't
match
it
I
rat-tat-tap
on
your
door
with
a
damn
ratchet
Attack-tack-tacking
a
whore
with
a
damn
hatchet
A
knapsack
packed
with
like
forty-some
Xanaxes
Shorty
come
back,
I'm
tryna
score
me
some
lap
dances
I'm
'bout
to
relapse,
so
baby
pour
me
some
Jack
Daniel's
Formula
44D
and
40's
with
bad
capsules
The
bad
apple
spoils
the
bunch,
I'm
back
at
ya
Girl,
I
don't
mean
any
harm
All
I
wanted
to
do
is
just
say
hello
And
are
you
menstruating,
baby?
My
little
friend's
waiting
to
say
hello
The
way
your
titties
are
wigglin'
And
your
booty's
shakin'
like
jello
Girl,
I
don't
mean
any
harm
All
I
wanted
to
do
is
just
say
hello,
yeah
My
equilibrium's
off,
must
be
the
lithium
I
don't
need
to
buy
any
drugs,
man,
people
give
me
'em
It
just
becomes
everyday,
extra-curriculum
No
reason
in
particular,
it
was
strictly
fun
A
fifth
of
rum
and
two
bottles
of
151
Fifty-one
people
asleep
in
my
damn
living
room
Excuse
me,
hun,
but
what
is
your
name,
Vivian?
I
woke
up
next
to
you
naked,
and
uh,
did
we,
um?
Of
course
we
did,
but
didn't
I
strap
Jimmy,
hun?
I'm
looking
for
the
torn
wrapper
but
there
don't
seem
to
be
one
No
offense
baby
girl,
I
don't
mean
any
harm
But
disease
is
something
I'm
trying
to
keep
my
penis
free
from
I
find
the
package
and
I'm
cool,
I
immediately
run
Like
Speedy
Gon-zales
to
see
if
I
see
anyone
Who
might
have
a
couple
of
3's,
I'm
fiending
for
some
My
head
is
pounding
to
the
beat
of
the
drum
Girl,
I
don't
mean
any
harm
All
I
wanted
to
do
is
just
say
hello
And
do
you
happen
to
have
anything
on
you
To
make
my
mood
mellow?
Some
are
oval
and
some
are
pink
Some
are
blue
and
some
are
just
yellow
Girl,
I
don't
mean
any
harm
All
I
wanted
to
do
is
just
say
hello
Oh,
those
were
the
days,
they
certainly
were
It's
hurting
me
to
know
that
I'll
be
closing
that
curtain
for
good
Word-word,
chk-word-word,
chk-word,
chk-chk-word
I
second
that
and
I
third,
rushed
to
emergency
surgery
To
try
to
flush
me
because
of
the
drugs
that
he
purchased
He's
no
longer
getting
them
free,
hundred
bucks
for
these
Percodans
Plus
it's
getting
to
be
where
he
lustfully
search
the
den
Pain
is
hitting
his
knee
and
his
muscles
be
hurtin'
him
Tirelessly
on
the
phone
trying
to
rustle
up
Muscle
relaxers
for
his
back
and
a
couple
of
Paxils
Now
he's
doubling
backwards
and
he's
stumbling
back
Slipped
and
fell,
hit
his
back,
boom,
heard
something
go
crack
Now
he's
up
in
the
bathroom
like
he's
busting
a
nap
Almost
ended
it
that
soon
because
of
the
fact
I'm
just
busting
my
own
chops
while
I'm
busting
a
rap
Resuscitated
and
rejuved,
so
fuck
it,
I'm
back
Girl,
I
don't
mean
any
harm
All
I
wanted
to
do
is
just

Thank

Same

Something

Same

Couple

The
police
constantly
bugging

I
walk
up
on

“Well,

I
think

your
OnStar
button
inside
your
car
stuck
You
out
of
gas?
Do
you
got

flat?
I
would
hate
for
you
to
be
stranded
at
the
laundromat
I
got
your
back
Why
don't
you
put
your
laundry
baskets
in
the
back
And
sit
up
front;
I'm
not
asking,
it's
a
trap
You
just
got
jacked
and
body
snatched,
and
it's
a
wrap
In
broad
day,
and
no
mask
for
this
attack
I
heard
'em
say
exact
opposites
attract
If
that's
a
fact,
it'll
take
task
force
to
get
you
back
Come
on
Yeah

that
dance
It's
the
last
dance

get
the

Girl,

That
windshield's

Same

The
first
victim
I
had,
she
was
a
big
one
Big
movie
star,
a
party
girl,
big
fun
She
was
the
girl
the
media
always
picked
on
In
and
out
of
rehab
every
four-to-six
months
She
was
always
known
for
little
pranks
and
slick
stunts
At
Nickelodeon,
flashed
the
little
kids
once
What
an
event
it
was,
I
was
sitting
in
front
I
was
hooked
in
at
the
first
glimpse
of
them
buns
Seen
her
backstage,
now
here's
where
I
come
in,
son
Look,
here
she
comes,
I
better
pull
out
the
big
guns
Hello
Lindsay,

looking
a
little
thin,

How

to
rehab?
Get

But
starting
off
on
the
wrong
foot
is
what
I
didn't
want
Girl,
I'm
just
kidding,
let
me
start
over
again,
hun
See
what
I
meant
was,

should
have
a
little
intervention
Come
with
me
to
Brighton,
let
me
relieve
your
tension
You
little
wench,
ya,
murder
wasn't
my
intention
If
I
wanted
to
kill
you,
it
would've
already
been
done
Slowly
she
gets
in
and
I
begin
to
lynch
her
With
66
inches
of
extension
cord
Yeah

that
dance
It's
the
last
dance

get
the
chance

Girl,

that
ass,
you
ain't
never
gonna
break
that

That
windshield's
too
strong
for
you
I
said,
yeah
baby,
sing
that
song
It's
the
last
song
you'll
ever
get
the
chance
to

You

little
thing,

what
you
got,
give
it
your
all
Look
at
you
bawl,
why
you
crying
to
me?
Same
song
and
dance
My
second
victim
was
even
bigger
than
the
first
Pop
star,
icon,
the
whole
works
She
played
a
little
schoolgirl
when
she
first
Burst
upon
the
scene
and
seen
that
the
world
was
hers
She
twirls
and
turns
and
flirts
in
skirts
so
bad
it
hurts
It
irked
me,
it
made
me
mad
at
first
I
lashed
out
in
my
songs,
but
what
was
really
going
on
Was
that
I
had
developed
a
crush
I
just
didn't
know
how
to
tell
it
to
her
Should
I
cut
off
one
of
my
ears
and
mail
it
to
her?
Send
her
pictures
of
my
collection
of
skeletons,
or
Footage
of
me
impaling
myself
on
an
elephant
tusk?
We'll
settle
this
once
and
for
all,
I'ma
tell
her
at
dusk
Tonight,
tonight
is
the
night,
and
tell
her
I
must
Creep
up
to
her
mansion
in
stilettos,
and
just
Climb
the
gate,
and
ring
the
bell,
like
"Hello,
my
love"
I
just
picked
your
prescription
for
Seroquel
up
Now
would
you
like
to
share
a
pill
or
two
with
me?
I'll
share
my
Valium
with
you
'cause
I'm
feeling
you
Britney
I'll
trade
you
a
blue
one
for
a
pink
one
Ever
since
a
schoolgirl
juvenile
delinquent
I've
been
feeling
you,
ooh-ooh,
girl,
you
sexy
little
gal,
you
Hold
that
pill
any
longer,
it'll
get
sentimental
value
C'mon
toots,
give
me
the
Valium
alley-oop
I'll
slam
dunk
it
in
your
mouth
'til
you
puke
And
just
as
soon
as
you
pass
out
in
your
alphabet
soup
I'm
'bout
to
make
a
new
outfit
out
of
you
New
outfit?
Shit,
I'll
make
a
suit
out
of
you,

Now,
show
me
how
you
move,
baby,
do
how
a-you

Yeah
baby,

that
dance
It's
the
last
dance
you'll
ever
get
the
chance
to
do
Girl,
shake
that
ass,
you
ain't
never
gonna
break
that
glass
That
windshield's
too
strong
for
you
I
said,
yeah

sing
that
song
It's
the
last
song
you'll
ever
get
the
chance
to
sing
You
sexy
little
thing,

Look

Same

Guess

Jessica
Simpson,

When
you
walked
through
the
door
(Woo!)
It
was
clear

me
(Clear

You’re

We’re

Ahem,
back
by
popular
demand
Now
pop
a
little
Zantac
for
antacid
if
you
can
You're
ready
to
tackle
any
task
that
is
at
hand?
How
does
it
feel?
Is
it
fantastic?
Is
it
grand?
Well,
look
at
all
the
massive
masses
in
the
stands
"Shady,
man,
no,
don't
massacre
the
fans!"
Damn,
I
think
Kim
Kardashian's
a
man
She
stomped
him,
just
‘cause
he
asked
to
put
his
hands
On
her
massive
gluteus
maximus
again
Squeeze
it,
then
squish
it,
then
pass
it
to
a
friend
Can
he
come
back
as
nasty
as
he
can?
Yes,
he
can-can;
don't
ask
me
this
again
He
does
not
mean
to
lesbian
offend
But
Lindsay,
please
come
back
to
seeing
men
Samantha's
a

you're
practically
a

I
know
you
want
me,
girl,
in
fact,
I
see
you
grin
Now
come
in,

When
you
walked

The

looking

Walk
up
to
the
cutest

charley-horse
her
Sorry,
Portia,
but
what's
Ellen
DeGeneres
Have
that
I
don't?
Are
you
telling
me
tenderness?
Well,
I
can
be
as
gentle
and
as
smooth
as
a
gentleman
Give
me
my
Ventolin
inhaler
and
two
Xenadrine
And
I'll
invite
Sarah
Palin
out
to
dinner,
then
Nail
her,
baby,
say
hello
to
my
little
friend!
Brit,
forget
K-Fed,
let's
cut
off
the
middleman
Forget
him
or
you're
gonna
end
up
in
the
hospital
again
And
this
time
it
won't
be
for
the
Ritalin
binge
Forget
them
other
men,
girl,
pay
them
little
attention
And
little
did
I
mention
that
Jennifer's
in
Love
with
me,
John
Mayer,
so
sit
on
the
bench
Man,
I
swear
them
other
guys,
you
give
'em
an
inch
They
take
a
mile;
they
got
style,
but
it
isn't

When
you
walked

(Woo!)
It

We’re

And
that's
why,
my
love
You'll
never
live
without
I
know
you
want
me,

'Cause
I
can
see
you
checking
me
out
And

you

You

Don't

I'm
the

you
(*fart*)
Damn,
girl,
I'm
beginning
to
sprout
an
Alfalfa
Why
should
I
wash
my
filthy
mouth
out?
You
think
that's
bad,
you
should
hear
the
rest
of
my
album
Never
has
there
been
such
finesse
and
nostalgia
Man,
Cash,
I
don't
mean
to
mess
with
your
gal,
but
Jessica
Alba
put
her
breasts
on
my
mouth
(Blup!)
Wowzers!
I
just
made
a
mess
in
my
trousers
And
they
wonder
why
I
keep
dressing
like
Elvis
"Lord,
help
us,
he's
back
in
his
pink
Alf
shirt
Looking
like
someone
shrinked
his
outfit!"
I
think
he's
'bout
to
flip,
Jessica
Rest

With

Baby,

met
your

Now
break

When

Yeah!
Oh

I

Oh
no,
I
can't

it
It's
like
I've
got
the
whole
world
in
my
palm
And
I'm
ready
to
drop
bombs
Welcome
to
the
Slim
Shady
Mecca,
Rebecca
It's
the
village
in
New
York,
right
next
to
the
Tribeca
That's
my
sector,
homosexual
dissector
Come

I
said,
nice

I
had
a

Hannibal

the

section,
I
bet
ya
I
tantalize
ya
and
in
less
than
five
seconds
I
get
ya
They
say
once
bitten
then
twice
shy,
well
lie
next
to
the
guy
With
nine
ecstasy
pills
and
five
extra
Boxes
of
ribbed
condoms
in
quantities,
why
yes
sir
I
took
the
rest
of
the
Lunesta
pills
from
my
dresser
That's
my
kind
of
vibe,
what
else
should
I
try,
Lester?
Drop-kick
the
bitch
before
her
second
trimester
Perform
the
home
abortion
with
Dexter,
then
I
guess
I'll
Dig
her
fetus
out
with
a
wire
hanger,
then
digest
her
I
guess
it's
time
for
you
to
hate
me
again
Let's
begin,
now
hand
me
the
pen
How
should
I
begin
it
and
where
does
it
all
end?

All

bitches
throw
it
up
Put
a
balloon
inside
your
pussy,
queef,
and
blow
it
up
Man,
I
think
that
he
just
fell
off
the
deep
end,
sure
enough
So
you
better
change
the
station
to
keep
from
throwing
up
Man,
you
seen
it
all
before,
you're
all
too
familiar
with
it
There's
a
penis
on
the
floor
and
two
balls,
so
you
know
who
did
it
You
know

don't

To
the
La-Z-Boy
sofa,
fold
her

then
sit
on
her
Imagine
the
visual
for
that,
man,
who
would've
thought
I
Could
ever
be
such
a
relentless
prick,
unleashing
his
vengeance
But
the
chick's
so
old,
she
looks
like
she
outlived
a
life
sentence
I
never
meant
this
rhyme
to
be
so
offensive
If
you
weren't
so
defensive,
it
wouldn't
be,
you're
so
sensitive
I
guess
it's
time
for
you
to
hate

Grab

With
both
hands,
man,
they
don't
understand,
I'm
just
a
sick
man
Now
everybody's
pissed
at
me
Like
it's
my
fault
his

rhymes
with
so
many
different
words,
jeez
So
one
last
time,
Mr.
Christopher
Reeves
Won't
you
break
it
down
for
me
and
just
spit
the
verse,
please?
"Eminem,
I'm
coming

kill
you

Always
hated
you,
and
I
still
do
You'll
never
fill
my
shoes,
my
Superman
costume

Doesn't
even
fit
you,
they
don't
feel
you
You're
taking
this
shit
too
far
(inhale)
Who
do
you
think
you
are?
Hang
my
suit
up
in
the
armoire
Every
day
I
hate
you
more
and
more,
throw
down
the
cardboard
Let's
breakdance

kidding
me
I
mean
with
this
Christopher
Reeves
shit?
You
know
the
guy's
dead,
right?
And
then
the
whole
gay
stepfather
incest
rape
thing?
I
don't
have
your
back
on
this
one
I
can't
even
fuckin'
handle
it,
I'm
done
Yo,
yo,
follow
me
Come
with
me
to
the
dark
side
of
the
force
No
man
would
boldly
go
to
this
place
The
devil
only
knows
of
this
world
So
dark
and,
oh,
so
cold,
it's,
oh,
so
cold
Oh,
so
cold,
oh
Soon
as
my
flow
starts
I
compose
art
like
the
ghost
of
Mozart
Even
though
they
all
say
that
they're
real,
I
know
that
most
aren't
Boy,
you
think
you're
clever,
don't
ya?
Girl,
you
think
you're
so
smart
Come
with
me
to
another
side
in
a
world
so
cold
and
so
dark
(Stay
wide

A
world
so
dark,
a
world
so
cold
A
world
where
on-ly
some
will
go
(Stay

But
none

when
will
they

Where

God

Fe-fi-fo-fum,
I
think
I
smell
the
scent
of
a
placenta
I
enter
Central
Park,
it's
dark,
it's
winter
in
December
I
see
my
target,
put
my
car
in
park,
and
approach
a
tender
Young
girl
by
the
name
of
Brenda,
and
I
pretend
to
befriend
her
Sit
down
beside
her
like
a
spider,
hi
there
girl,
you
mighta
Heard
of
me
before,
see
whore,
you're
the
kind
of
girl
that
I'd
a–
-ssault
and
rape,
then
figure
why
not
try
to
make
your
pussy
wider
Fuck
you
with
an
umbrella
then
open
it
up
while
the
shit's
inside
ya
I'm
the
kind
of
guy
that's
mild
but
I
might
flip
and
get
a
little
bit
wilder
Impregnate
a
lesbian,
yeah,
now
let's
see
her
have
triplets,
and
I'll
di–
-sintegrate
them
babies
as
soon
as
they're
out
her
with
formalde–
-hyde
and
cyanide,
girl,
you
can
try
and
hide,
you
can
try
to
scream
louder
No
need
for
no
gunpowder,
that
only
takes
all
the
fun
out
of
Murderin',
I'd
rather
go
vinn-vinn,
and
now
you
see
just
how
the
Fuck
I
do
just
what
I
do
when
I
cut
right
through
your
scalp,
uhh
Shit,
wait
a
minute,
I
mean
skull,
my
knife
seems
dull,
pull
another
one
out,
uh
Soon
as
my
flow
starts
I
compose
art

Come
with
me
to
another
side
in
a

(Stay

A

God

(Stay

So
dark
and
so
cold,
my
friends
don't
know
this
other
side
of
me
There's
a
monster
inside
of
me,
it's
quite
ugly
and
it
frightens
me
But
they
can't
see
what
I
can
see,
there's
a
vacancy
in
my
tummy
It's
makin'
me
play
hide-and-seek
like
Jason,
I'm
so
hungry
She's
naked,
see,
no
privacy,
but
I
can
see
she
wants
me
So
patient,
see,
I
try
to
be,
but
gee,
why
does
she
taunt
me?
Pulls
the
drapes
and
she
goes
right
to
sleep
and
I
creep
right
through
the
front,
see
So
blatantly,
but
silently
'cause
I
know
that
she's
sound
'sleep
"Who's
wakin'
me
so
violently,
and
why's
he
on
top
of
me?"
"He's
rapin'
me,"
she
tries
to
scream,
"Somebody
please
get
him
off
me
He's
tapin'
me,
he's
bitin'
me,
he's
laughin'
like
it's
funny"
She's
scrapin'
me,
she's
fightin'
me,
she's
scratchin'
like
some
dumb
freak
Escapin'
me,
no
dice,
you
see,
I
might
just
be
Ted
Bundy
Or
Satan,
gee,
what
a
sight
to
see,
I'm
dancin'
in
my
red
panties
I'm
crazy,
but
it's
alright
with
me,
man,
life
can
be
so
empty
Stay
away
from
me
'cause
I'm
dancin'
to
quite
a
different
drum
beat
Soon
as
my
flow
starts
I
compose
art
like
the

God

(Stay

Better
try
to
stay
wide
awake
or
you
might
end
up
found
dead
by
the
lake
Soon
as
you
lay
me
down
to
sleep,
bitch,
your
soul
I'ma
try
to
take
Pray
for
light
of
day
right
away,
why
do
they
try
to
fight
today?
I
must
make
them
pay
twice
as
much,
might
as
well
put
the
knife
away
Now
I
use
power
tools,
how
'bout
now,
are
you
in
the
shower?
Scour
you
for
six
hours
'til
outage
of
power
outlets
How
did
you
figure
out
I
was
down
in
your
basement?
Now
ya
Must've
just
heard
the
sound
of
my
stomach
growlin'
from
down
there
Prowler,
there's
no
one
fouler,
bound
ya,
that's
how
they
found
ya
Face
down
in
the
tub,
I
drown
ya
with
piles
of
downers
around
ya
Such
nostalgia
and
power,
such
prowess,
look
how
you
cower
Jump
out
on
you
now
like
I
was
a
Jawa
from
fuckin'
Star
Wars
Jabba
the
Hutt,
biddy-bye-bye,
biddy-bye-bye,
it's
time
to
die-die
Ought
to
not
even
bother
to
scream,
it
don't
even
matter
Amazing
when
grazin'
skin
with
these
razor
blades
he
waves
at
ya
Not
ya
everyday
Damien,
bathe
me
in
holy
water
Nothing
like
Son
of
Sam,
so
please
understand
there's
no
gun
in
hand
Where's
the
thrill
in
the
hunt?
There's
no
fun
in
that,
here
I
come
with
axe
Fun
to
act
like
lumberjack
when
I'm
hackin'
'em
up
with
that
What
was
that?
Dial
9-1-1,
someone's
comin'
in
from
the

Soon

Good
evening
This
is
your
fucking
captain
speaking
We
will
soon
be
reaching
an
altitude
of
Four
million
and
a
half..
feet
That's
eight
million
miles
in
the
sky
Please...
undo
your
seat
belt
for
takeoff
You
are
now
free
to
smoke
about
the
cabin
(chkk)
I'm
Dre,
from
back
in
the
day
From
N.W.A,
from
black
and
the
gray
From
choking
a
bitch,
to
smacking
her
face
From
stacking
up
bodies,
to
racking
AKs
up
From
racking
up
hits,
to
stacking
them
crates
up
I'm
still
hungry,
and
I'm
back
with
a
tapeworm
And
we're
what's
happenin'
in
rap
entertainment
Me
and
Shady,
as
far
as
competition,
faggot,
there
ain't
none
Speak
of
the
Devil,
it's
attack
of
the
Rain
Man
Chainsaw
in
hand,
bloodstain
on
my
apron
Soon
as
the
blade
spun,
vrrunn,
they
run
away
from
Who
wanna
play
dungeon?
No
one
is
safe
from
In
search
of
a
brain
surgeon,
a
great
one
Wait,
it
ain't
funny,
man,
it's
urgent,
I
need
one
Two
boxes
of
detergent
in
a
paint
gun
And
an
emergency
squirt
gun
to
spray
A-1
So
one
more
time
for
old
time's
sake
Dre,
drop
that
beat
and
scratch
that
break
Now
just

a

(You

Smoke
signal
in
the
sky
like
Verizon
Wireless
A
nice
environment,
surprised
entirely
Hypnotized
by
the
sound,
I
surround
the
hydrants
Taking
lives
of
firemen;
say
goodbye,
here
I
am
again
Naked
wives
and
Vicodin
Before
I
begin
to
get
so
high,
pussy
boy,
I
could
spin
Vinn-vinn,
fuck
the
handle,
I
fly
off
the
hinge
Let
that
boy
off
the
bench,
coach,
and
throw
it
to
him
There
he
goes
in
his
trench
coat,
no
clothes
again
Baby,
make
us
some
french
toast
and
show
us
some
skin
I'll
show
you
every
inch
grows
on
my
foreskin
Show
me
nipple,
I
pinch
both,
and
throw
up
a
ten
Now
you
know
it's
a
sin
to
tease,
blow
us
again
The
sorcerer
of
intercourse;
if
it's
forced,
it's
him
Don't
fight
the
feeling
if
you're
feeling
the
force
within
And
when
you
wake
up
in
the
morning
next
to
the
porcelain
So
one
more
time
for
old
time's
sake
Dre,
drop
that
beat
and
scratch
that
break
Now
just

And

(You

Now
where
there's
smoke,
there's
fire
Where
there's
fire,
there's
flames
Where
there's
flames,
there's
chronic
Either
you
high
or
you
ain't
I
got
no
time
for
no
games
Nuh-uh,
he
ain't
playin'
He's
gon'
get
the
AK
and
aim
it
right
at
your
brain
I'm
slightly
insane,
vodka
and
creatine
Hpnotiq
and
Red
Bull,
it's
an
incredible
energy
drink
And
it's
given
me
wings,
I
believe
I
can
fly
While
I
pee
on
a
girl,
you
won't
catch
me
CSI
It's
as
easy
as
pie,
and
as
simple
as
cake
Dre,
get
on
the
mic
and
make
'em
tremble
and
shake
Now
put
your
smoke
up
in
the
air,
raise
your
Henny
and
Coke
And
if
you
really
wanna
get
fucked
up,
just
let
me
know
We
can
smoke
'til
there's
no
more
lighter
fluid
to
do
it
Let's
get
into
it,
you're
smokin'
with
the
triedest
and
truest
I
got
the
Midas
touch
when
it
comes
to
rollin'
shit
up
You
motherfuckers
ain't
smokin',
you
just
holdin'
shit
up
Now
here
we
go,
let's
get
up,
get
down,
hold
up
a
blunt
I
smoke
the
kinda
stuff
that
make
the
records
go
number
one
'Cause
if
at
first
you
don't
succeed
Won't
hurt
to
smoke
some
weed
Now
them
words
are
just
a
little
more
personal
for
me
Seeing
as
how
I
blew
up
off
of
puffing
them
trees
Well
smoke
enough
for
me,
fuck
yeah,
light
it
up,
Cheech
Come
on,
smoke
me
out
cuz,
give
me
contact
buzz
Get
me
on
track,
they
love
me
when
I'm
on
that
stuff
But
this
is
Earth
calling
Shady,
man,
come
on
back—What?
Man,
we're
losing
him,
he
won't
even
respond
back,
fuck!
Now
look
at
all
the
pretty
women
in
here
(Damn,
bitches!)
Dre,
it's
hot,
I
think
we
better
go
check
on
their
temperatures
I'll
get
the
thermometer,
you
get
the
bandages
Now
baby,
just
bend
over,
this
won't
hurt
a
damn
bit,
just—
Give
me
one
more
time
for
old
time's
sake
Dre,
drop
that
beat
and
scratch
that
break
Now
just
blow
a
little
bit
of
that
smoke
my
way
And
let's
go
(You
are
now
smokin'
with
the
best)
I
said,
one
more
time
for
old
time's
sake
Dre,
drop
that
beat
and
scratch
that
break
Now
just
send
a
little
bit
of
that
smoke
my
way
And
let's
go
(You
are
now
smokin'
with
the
best)
Yeah,
ohh,
yeah
yeah,
ohh
I
feel
like
dancing,
I
feel
like
dancing
I
smell
something
in
the
air
that's
making
me
(High)
I
said,
I
smell
something
in

high
Okay,
here
we
go,
do-re-mi-fa-so,
fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Lyrical
Roscoe,
kick
back
the
Tabasco
You
motherfuckers
must
just
not
know
the
tick-tock,
so
Time
to
show
you
the
most
kick-ass
flow
in
the
cosmos
Picasso
with
a
pick-axe,
a
sick
asshole
Tic-tac-toe
'cross
your
six-pack
with
X-acto
Knives,
stranglin'
wives
with
thick

Big
bags
of
the
grass,
Zig-Zags,
I'm
with
the
Doc,
so
You
know
how
that
go,
skull
and
the

This
is
poison
to
boys
and
girls
who
do
not
know
You
do
not
wanna
try
this
at
home,
my
lil'
vato
This
is
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
to
get
macho
So
crack
a
six-pack,
sit
back
with
some
nachos
Maybe
some
popcorn
and
watch
the
show
and
just
rock
slow
It's
not
what
you
expected,
nor
what
you
thought,
so
'Bout
time
that
you
wake
the
fuck
up,
smell
the
pot
smoke
It
must
be
the
ganja,
it's
the
marijuana
That's
creeping
up
on
me,
why
I'm
so
high
Maybe
it's
the
Henny
that
has
gotten
in
me
Whatever's
got
into
me,
I
don't
mind
I
said
it's
the
ganja,
it's
the
marijuana
That's
creeping
up
on
me,
why
I'm

Maybe
it's

Whatever's

I
don't

Your

are
gettin'
fulfilled,
ooh,
I'm
literally
gettin'
a
chill
Spittin'
at

me
and
Dre
have
just
finished
splittin'
a
pill
You're
submittin'
to
skill,
sittin'
still
I'm
admittin'
I'm
beginnin'
to
feel
like
I
don't
think
anyone's
real
Faced
with
a
dilemma:
I
can
be
Dalai
Lama
And
be
calm
or
bring
drama,
a
step

Please
don't
upset
me,
mama,
you're
lookin'
sexy,

Don't

How
many
people
you
know
who
can
name
every
serial
Killer
who
ever
existed
in
a

Put
'em
in
chronological
order,

Name
the

and
place;
from

the

the

Location
of
the

where
the
body
was
dragged
and
then
dumped
The
trunk
that
they
were
stuffed
in,
the
model,
the
make,
the
plate
And
which
model,
which
lake
they
found
her
in,
how
they
attacked
the
victim
Say
which
murder
weapon
was
used
to
do
what
in
which
one
Which
knife
and
which
gun,
what
kid,
what
wife,
and
which
nun
Don't
stop,
I
like
this,
it's
fun,
the
fuckin'
night's
just
begun
It
must
be
the
ganja,
it's
the
marijuana
That's
creeping
up
on
me,
why
I'm
so
high
Maybe
it's
the
Henny
that
has
gotten
in

Whatever's
got

I
don't

When
I'm
behind
the
mic,
dynamite's
what
it's
kinda
like
You're
stuck
with
the

stick
that
you're
tryna
light
Behind
the

sits
Dre,
legends
are
made
this
way
Isn't
it
safe
to
say
this
is
the
way
it
should
be?
Maybe
you
need
some
lyric
syrup
serum
for
your

Here's
a
dosage
of
the
antidote,

you

So
unbelievable,
it's
a

cranium
that's
full
of
sur–

when
the
smoke
rises
right
before

You
stare
into
your

(High)
Good

isn't
even
a
weed
thing
I
ain't
even
smoke
anything,
I
ain't
even

It
must
be
the

it's

marijuana
That's

Will
update
en
route,
ETA:
ten
minutes
As
I
fall
deeper
into
a
manic
state
I'm
a
prime
candidate
for
the
gene
To
receive
the
drug
addict
trait
Blood
pressure
climbs
at
a
dramatic
rate
I
seem
to
gravitate
to
the
bottle
of
NyQuil
then
I
salivate
Start
off
with
the
NyQuil,
like,
"I
think
I'll
just
have
a
taste"
Couple
of
sips
of
that
then
I
gradually
graduate
To
a
harder
prescription
drug
called
Valium
Like,
"yeah,
that's
great"
I
go
to
just
take
one
and
I
end
up
like
having
eight
Now
I
need
something
in
my
stomach
'cause
I
haven't
ate
Maybe
I'll
grab
a
plate
of
nachos
and
I'll
have
a
steak
And
you'd
think
that
with
all
I
have
at
stake
Look
at
my
daughter's
face
"Mommy,
something
is
wrong
with
Dad
I
think
He's
acting
weird
again,
he's
really
beginning
to
scare
me
Won't
shave
his
beard
again
and
he
pretends
he
doesn't
hear
me
And
all
he
does
is
eat
Doritos
and
Cheetos
And
he
just
fell
asleep
in
his
car
eating
3
Musketeers
in
the
rear
seat"
Sometimes
I
feel
so
alone,
I
just
don't
know
Feels
like
I
been
down
this
road
before
So
lonely
and
cold,
it's
like
something
takes
over
me
As
soon
as
I
go
home
and
close
the
door
Kinda
feels
like
déjà
vu
I
wanna
get
away
from
this
place,
I
do
But
I
can't
and
I
won't,
say
I
try,
but
I
know
That's
a
lie
'cause
I
don't
And
why,
I
just
don't
know
"Maybe
just
a
nice
cold
brew,
what's
a
beer?"
That's
the
devil
in
my
ear,
I've
been
sober
a
fuckin'
year
And
that
fucker
still
talks
to
me,
he's
all
I
can
fucking
hear
"Marshall,
come
on,
we'll
watch
the
game
It's
the
Cowboys
and
Buccaneers"
"And
maybe
if
I
just
drink
half
I'll
be
half-buzzed
for
half
of
the
time"
Who's
the
mastermind
behind
that
little
line?
With
that
kind
of
rationale,
man,
I
got
half
a
mind
To
have
another
half
a
glass
of
wine
Sounds
asinine,
yeah,
I
know
But
I
never
had
no
problem
with
alcohol
Ouch,
look
out
for
the
wall,
aim
for
the
couch,
I'm
'bout
to
fall
I
miss
the
couch
and
down
I
go,
lookin'
like
a
bouncy
ball
Shit
must've
knocked
me
out
'cause
I
ain't
feel
the
ground
at
all
Wow,
what
the
fuck
happened
last
night?
Where
am
I?
Man,
fuck,
am
I
hungover,
and
goddamn,
I
got
a
headache
Shit,
half
a
Vicodin,
why
can't
I?
All
systems
ready
for
take
off,
please
stand
by
Sometimes
I
feel
so
alone,
I
just
don't
know
Feels
like
I
been
down
this
road
before
So
lonely
and
cold,
it's
like
something
takes
over
me
As
soon
as
I
go
home
and
close
the
door
Kinda
feels
like
déjà
vu
I
wanna
get
away
from
this
place,
I
do
But
I
can't
and
I
won't,
say
I
try,
but
I
know
That's
a
lie'
cause
I
don't
And
why,
I
just
don't
know
So
I
take
a
Vicodin,
splash,
it
hits
my
stomach,
then
(Ahhh!)
Couple
of
weeks
go
by,
it
ain't
even
like
I'm
gettin'
high
Now
I
need
it
just
not
to
feel
sick,
yeah,
I'm
gettin'
by
Wouldn't
even
be
taking
this
shit
if
DeShaun
didn't
die
Oh
yeah,
there's
an
excuse;
you
lose
Proof,
so
you
use
There's
new
rules,
it's
cool
if
it's
helpin'
you
to
get
through
It's
twelve-noon,
ain't
no
harm
in
self-inducin'
a
snooze
What
else
is
new?
Fuck
it,
what
would
Elvis
do
in
your
shoes?
Now
here
I
am
three
months
later,
full-blown
relapse
"Just
get
high
until
the
kids
get
home
from
school,
homes,
relax"
And
since
I'm
convinced
that
I'm
an
insomniac
I
need
these
pills
to
be
able
to
sleep,
so
I
take
three
naps
Just
to
be
able
to
function
throughout
the
day,
let's
see
That's
an
Ambien
each
nap,
how
many
Valium?
Three?
And
that
will
average
out
to
about
one
good
hour's
sleep
Okay,
so
now
ya
see
the
reason
how
come
he
Has
taken
four
years
to
just
put
out
an
album,
B
See,
me
and
you,
we
almost
had
the
same
outcome,
Heath
'Cause
that
Christmas,
you
know
the
whole
pneumonia
thing?
It
was
bologna,
was
it
the
methadone,
ya
think?
Or
the
hydrocodone
you
hide
inside
your
pornos?
Your
VCR
tape
cases,
with
your
Ambien
CR
Great
places
to
hide
'em,
ain't
it?
So
you
can
lie
to
Hailie
I'm
going
beddy-bye,
Whitney,
baby;
good
night,
Alaina!
Go
in
the
room
and
shut
the
bedroom
door
And
wake
up
in
an
ambulance
They
said
they
found
me
on
the
bathroom
floor,
damn
Sometimes
I
feel
so
alone,
I
just
don't
know
Feels
like
I
been
down
this
road
before
So
lonely
and
cold,
it's
like
something
takes

As
soon
as
I
go
home
and
close
the

Kinda
feels

from
this

I
do
But
I
can't
and
I
won't,
say
I
try,
but
I
know
that's
a
lie
'Cause
I
don't
and
why,
I
just
don't
know
Lately
I've
been
hard
to
reach
I've
been
too
long
on
my
own
Everybody
has
a
private
world
Where
they
can
be
alone
Are
you
calling
me?
Are
you
trying
to
get
through?
Are
you
reaching
out
for
me?
Then
I'm
reaching
out
for
you
I'm
just
so
fuckin'
depressed
I
just
can't
seem
to
get
out
this
slump
If
I
could
just
get
over
this
hump
But
I
need
somethin'
to
pull
me
out
this
dump
I
took
my
bruises,
took
my
lumps
Fell
down
and
I
got
right
back
up
But
I
need
that
spark
to
get
psyched
back
up
In
order
for
me
to
pick
the
mic
back
up
I
don't
know
how
or
why
or
when
I
ended
up
in
this
position
I'm
in
I'm
starting
to
feel
distant
again
So
I
decided
just
to
pick
this
pen
Up
and
try
to
make
an
attempt
to
vent
But
I
just
can't
admit
Or
come
to
grips
with
the
fact
that
I
may
be
done
with
rap
I
need
a
new
outlet
And
I
know
some
shit's
so
hard
to
swallow
But
I
just
can't
sit
back
and
wallow
In
my
own
sorrow,
but
I
know
one
fact:
I'll
be
one
tough
act
to
follow
One
tough
act
to
follow,
I'll
be
one
tough
act
to
follow
Here
today,
gone
tomorrow
But
you'd
have
to
walk
a
thousand
miles—
In
my
shoes,
just
to
see
What
it's
like
to
be
me
I'll
be
you,
let's
trade
shoes
Just
to
see
what
it'd
be
like
to
Feel
your
pain,
you
feel
mine
Go
inside
each
other's
minds
Just
to
see
what
we
find
Look
at
shit
through
each
other's
eyes
But
don't
let
'em
say
you
ain't
beautiful
They
can
all
get
fucked,
just
stay
true
to
you
Don't
let
'em
say
you
ain't
beautiful
They
can
all
get
fucked,
just
stay
true
to
you
I
think
I'm
starting
to
lose
my
sense
of
humor
Everything's
so
tense
and
gloom
I
almost
feel
like
I
gotta
check
the
temperature
Of
the
room,
just
as
soon
as
I
walk
in,
it's
like
all
eyes
on
me
So
I
try
to
avoid
any
eye
contact
‘Cause
if
I
do
that,
then
it
opens
a
door
For
conversation
like
I
want
that
I'm
not
lookin'
for
extra
attention
I
just
wanna
be
just
like
you
Blend
in
with
the
rest
of
the
room
Maybe
just
point
me
to
the
closest
restroom
I
don't
need
no
fuckin'
man
servant
Tryna
follow
me
around
and
wipe
my
ass
Laugh
at
every
single
joke
I
crack
And
half
of
'em
ain't
even
funny,
like,
"Ha!
Marshall,
you're
so
funny,
man
You
should
be
a
comedian,
goddamn!"
Unfortunately
I
am
I
just
hide
behind
the
tears
of
a
clown
So
why
don't
you
all
sit
down?
Listen
to
the
tale
I'm
about
to
tell
Hell,
we
don't
gotta
trade
our
shoes
And
you
ain't
gotta
walk
no
thousand
miles—
In
my
shoes,
just
to
see
What
it's
like
to
be
me
I'll
be
you,
let's
trade
shoes
Just
to
see
what
it'd
be
like
to
Feel
your
pain,
you
feel
mine
Go
inside
each
other's
minds
Just
to
see
what
we
find
Look
at
shit
through
each
other's
eyes
But
don't
let
'em
say
you
ain't
beautiful
They
can
all
get
fucked,
just
stay
true
to
you
Don't
let
'em
say
you
ain't
beautiful
They
can
all
get
fucked,
just
stay
true
to
you
Nobody
asked
for
life
to
deal
us
With
these
bullshit
hands
we're
dealt
We
gotta
take
these
cards
ourselves
And
flip
'em,
don't
expect
no
help
Now,
I
could've
either
just
sat
on
my
ass
and
pissed
and
moaned
Or
take
this
situation
in
which
I'm
placed
in
And
get
up
and
get
my
own
I
was
never
the
type
of
kid
to
wait
by
the
door
and
pack
his
bags
And
sat
on
the
porch
and
hoped
and
prayed
For
a
dad
to
show
up
who
never
did
I
just
wanted
to
fit
in
in
every
single
place,
every
school
I
went
I
dreamed
of
being
that
cool
kid
Even
if
it
meant
acting
stupid
Aunt
Edna
always
told
me:
"Keep
making
that
face,
it'll
get
stuck
like
that."
Meanwhile,
I'm
just
standin'
there
Holdin'
my
tongue,
tryin'
to
talk
like
this
'Til
I
stuck
my
tongue
on
that
frozen
stop
sign
pole
at
8
years
old
I
learned
my
lesson
then
‘Cause
I
wasn't
tryin'
to
impress
my
friends
no
mo'
But
I
already
told
you
my
whole
life
story
Not
just
based
on
my
description
‘Cause
where
you
see
it
from
where
you're
sittin'
It's
probably
110%
different
I
guess
we
would
have
to
walk
a
mile
in
each
other's
shoes
at
least
What
size
you
wear?
I
wear
10's
Let's
see
if
you
can
fit
your
feet—
In
my
shoes,
just
to
see
What
it's
like
to
be
me
I'll
be
you,
let's
trade
shoes
Just
to
see
what
it'd
be
like
to
Feel
your
pain,
you
feel
mine
Go
inside
each
other's
minds
Just
to
see
what
we
find
Look
at
shit
through
each
other's
eyes
But
don't
let
'em
say
you
ain't
beautiful
They
can
all
get
fucked,
just
stay
true
to
you
Don't
let
'em
say
you
ain't
beautiful
They
can
all
get
fucked,
just
stay
true
to
you
Lately
I've
been
hard
to
reach
I've
been
too
long
on
my
own
Everybody
has
a
private
world
Where
they
can
be
alone
Are
you
calling
me?
Are
you
trying
to
get
through?
Are
you
reaching
out
for
me?
Then
I'm
reaching
out
for
you
Yeah,
to
my
babies:
stay
strong
Daddy'll
be
home
soon
And
to
the
rest
of
the
world:
God
gave
you
them
shoes
to
fit
you
So
put
'em
on
and
wear
'em,
be
yourself,
man
Be
proud
of
who
you
are,
even
if
it
sounds
corny
Never
let
no
one
tell
you
you
ain't
beautiful
Oh!
Ladies
and
gentlemen
The
moment
you've
all
been
waiting
for
In
this
corner,
weighing
175
pounds
With
a
record
of
17
rapes,
400
assaults,
and
4
murders
The
undisputed,
most
diabolical
villain
in
the
world
Slim
Shady!
(Let's
go!)
So
crack
a
bottle,
let
your
body
waddle
Don't
act
like
a
snobby
model,
you
just
hit
the
lotto
Oh-oh,
oh-oh,
bitches
hoppin'
in
my
Tahoe
Got
one
ridin'
shotgun
and
no,
not
one
of
'em
got
clothes
Now,
where's
the
rubbers?
Who's
got
the
rubbers?
I
noticed
there's
so
many
of
'em
And
there's
really
not
that
many
of
us
And
ladies
love
us,
my
posse's
kickin'
up
dust
It's
on
'til
the
break
of
dawn
and
we're
starting
this
party
from
dusk
Okay,
let's
go!
Back
with
Andre
the
Giant,
Mr.
Elephant
Tusk
Fix
your
musk,
you'll
be
just
another
one
bit
the
dust
Just
one
of
my
mother's
sons
who
got
thrown
under
the
bus
Kiss
my
butt,
lick
fromunda
cheese
from
under
my
nuts
It
disgusts
me
to
see
the
game
the
way
that
it
looks
It's
a
must,
I
redeem
my
name
and
haters
get
mushed
Bitches
lust,
man,
they
love
me
when
I
lay
in
the
cut
Fisticuffs,
the
lady
give
her
eighty-some
paper
cuts
Now
picture
us;
it's
ridiculous,
you
curse
at
the
thought
'Cause
when
I
spit
the
verse
the
shit
gets
worse
than
Worcestershire
sauce
If
I
could
fit
the
words,
it's
picture
perfect,
works
every
time
Every
verse,
every
line,
as
simple
as
nursery
rhymes
It's
elementary,
the
elephants
have
entered
the
room
I
venture
to
say
we're
the
center
of
attention,
it's
true
Not
to
mention
back
with
a
vengeance,
so
hence
the
signal
Of
the
bat
symbol,
the
platinum
trio's
back
on
you
hoes
So
crack
a
bottle,
let
your
body
waddle
Don't
act
like
a
snobby
model,
you
just
hit
the
lotto
Oh-oh,
oh-oh,
bitches
hoppin'
in
my
Tahoe
Got
one
ridin'
shotgun
and
no,
not
one
of
'em
got
clothes
Now,
where's
the
rubbers?
Who's
got
the
rubbers?
I
noticed
there's
so
many
of
'em
And
there's
really
not
that
many
of
us
And
ladies
love
us,
my
posse's
kickin'
up
dust
It's
on
'til
the
break
of
dawn
and
we're
starting
this
party
from
dusk
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
Dr.
Dre!
They
see
that
low
rider
go
by,
they're
like,
"Oh
my!"
You
ain't
got
to
tell
me
why
you're
sick
'cause
I
know
why
I
dip
through
in
that
Six-Trey
like,
"Sick
'em,
Dre!"
I'm
an
itch
that
they
can't
scratch,
they're
sick
of
me
But
hey,
what
else
can
I
say?
I
love
L.A.
'Cause
over
and
above
all,
it's
just
another
day
And
this
one
begins
where
the
last
one
ends
Pick
up
where
we
left
off
and
get
smashed
again
I'll
be
damned,
just
fucked
around
and
crashed
my
Benz
Drivin'
'round
with
a
smashed
front
end,
let's
cash
that
one
in
Grab
another
one
from
out
the
stable
The
Monte
Carlo,
El
Camino,
or
the
El
Dorado?
The
hell
if
I
know,
do
I
want
leather
seats
or
vinyl?
Decisions,
decisions,
garage
looks
like
Precision
Collision
Or
Maaco,
beats
quake
like
Waco
Just
keep
the
bass
low,
speakers
away
from
your
face
though
So
crack
a
bottle,
let
your
body
waddle
Don't
act
like
a
snobby
model,
you
just
hit
the
lotto
Oh-oh,
oh-oh,
bitches
hoppin'
in
my
Tahoe
Got
one
ridin'
shotgun
and

Who's

It's

'til
the
break
of
dawn
and
we're
starting
this
party
from
dusk
And
I
take
great
pleasure
in
introducing
50
Cent!
It's
bottle
after
bottle
The
money
ain't
a
thing
when
you
party
with
me
It's
what
we
into,
it's
simple
We
ball
out
of
control
like
you
wouldn't
believe
I'm
the
napalm,
the
bomb,
the
Don,
I'm
King
Kong
Get
rolled
on,
wrapped
up,
and
reigned
on
I'm
so
calm,
through
Vietnam,
ring
the
alarm
Bring
the
Chandon,
burn
marijuan',
do
what
you
want
Nigga,
on
and
on
'til
the
break
of
what?
Get

paper,

I'm
cakin',
you
know
I
don't
give
a
fuck
I
spend

Blow

like

to
be
blown,

I'm
grown

(Yeah)
Fat-ass
Birkin
bags,
some
classy
shit
(Haha)
Jimmy
Choo
shoes;
I
say,
"Move,"
a
bitch
move
So
crack
a
bottle,
let
your
body
waddle
Don't
act
like
a
snobby
model,
you
just
hit
the
lotto
Oh-oh,
oh-oh,
bitches
hoppin'
in
my
Tahoe
Got
one
ridin'
shotgun
and
no,
not
one
of
'em

Who's

I

And
ladies
love

my
posse's
kickin'
up
dust
It's
on
'til
the
break
of
dawn
and
we're
starting
this
party
from
dusk
Mr.
Berman?
What?
We
have
Eminem
here
to
see
you
About
fuckin'
time!
Send
him
in
Steve!
Good
to
see
ya,
man.
Um,
hey,
I
just
w–
Well,
look
who
decided
to
show
his
face!
I
hope
you've
had
fun
in
the
last
four
years
Look
man,
I
apologize
again
for–
For
shooting
me?!
Do
you
know
I
lost
the
use
of
my
right
arm?
Again,
it
was
a
mistake,
a
terrible
mist–
Are
you
wearing
a
bulletproof
vest?
And
then
you
go
and
do
what?
Hide
out?
Stay
in
Detroit
for
almost
five
years
While
the
music
industry
melts
the
fuck
down?
Do
you
know
how
many
people
lost
their
jobs
Because
of
your
fuckin'
vacation?
Well,
that's
actually
why
I'm
here
I
was
gonna
put
out
some
new
music
And
I
wanted
to
play
it
for
you
and
get
your
opinion
Do
I
really
need
to
hear
it?
Let
me
guess,
another
album
about:
"Poor
me!
I'm
so
famous
that
it's
ruined
my
rich
little
life
And
I'm
such
a
tortured
artist,
let
me
make
music
about
it
And
my
tragic
love
life!"
Am
I
on
to
something
here?
Come
on,
man,
it's
not
like
that
You
know
what?
Just
hand
the
fuckin'
thing
over!
I'm

Up

Gave

Insanity,
can
it
be
vanity?
Where's
the
humanity
in
having
a
twisted
fantasy
With
an
arm-and-leg
amputee?
Straitjacket
with
a
hundred
and
eight
brackets
And
a
strap
that
wraps
twice
around
my
back
Then
they
latch
it;
cut
your
fuckin'
head
off
And
ask
where
you're
headed
off
to
Get
it?
"Headed
off

Medic,
this
headache's

This
anesthetic's

waffle
And
this

So,
it
wasn't
a
choice,
it
was
"I
had
to
do
this."
And
now
I
got
90
days
clean
And
uh,
that's
all
I
have
to
share,
thanks
(Thanks
for
sharing,
Brian
Is
there
anyone
else
who'd
like
to
share
this
evening?)
Yeah,
I
got
something
to
share:
"When
you
walked
through
the
door
you
were
queer
to
me
So

baby
boy,

You're
a

wants
you
You're
gayer

I
won't

So,

Lay

Lay

Where's
everybody
going?
This
always
went
over
real
big
in
Gay-A
Okay,
wait,
I
got
another
one
"I
just
love
condoms
and
lots
of
cum."
No?
Well,

Who'd

Labels

Everybody

what
the
fuck
That
I'm
talkin'
about
when
we
riot
You
dealin'
with
a
few
true
villains
Who
stand
inside
of
a
booth,
truth-spillin'
And
spit
true
feelings
until
our
tooth
fillings
Come
flyin'
up
out
of
our
mouths,
now,
rewind
it
Payback,
motherfucker
For
the
way
that
you
doubted
me,
how's
it
taste?
When
I
slap
the
taste
outta
your
mouth
With
the
bass
so
loud
that
it
shakes
the
place
I'm
Hannibal
Lecter,
so
just
in
case
you're
thinkin'
of
savin'
face
You
ain't
gonna
have
no
face
to
save
By
the
time
I'm
through
with
this
place,
so
Drake
It
may
not
mean
nothin'
to
y'all
But
understand,
nothin'
was
done
for
me
So
I
don't
plan
on
stoppin'
at
all
I
want
this
shit
forever,
mane,
ever,
mane,
ever,
mane
I'm
shuttin'
shit
down
in
the
mall
And
tellin'
every
girl
she
the
one
for
me
And
I
ain't
even
plannin'
to
call
I
want
this
shit
forever,
mane,
ever,
mane,
ever,
mane
I
want
you
to
understand
something
That
when
I
come
up
in
this
bitch,
I
want
the
fans
jumping
I
want
the
fists
pumping
in
the
air,
I
don't
look
like
a
millionaire
But
I
feel
like
a
million
bucks,
ladies
won't
ya
fill
your
cups?
Shady's
come
to
feel
ya
up,
are
you
a
D
or
a
C
cup?
You
could
even
be
a
B,
it's
just
me
and
D-R-E
You'll
be
in
the
ER,
we
are
strapped
with
so
much
TNT
We
may
blow,
no,
not
even
CPR
from
the
EMTs
Could
help
you
to
resuscitate,
you
busters
must
be
flustered,
wait
You
can't
cut
the
mustard
What's
your
problem,
can't
you
bust
a
grape?
(Chkk-chk-chk)
What's
my
name?
Shady
came
and
just
crushed
the
game
It's
really
not
even
fair
to
them
'Cause
they
pale
in
comparison
So
much
they
might
as
well
wear
his
skin
Don't
you
wish
you
could
just
share
his
pen?
'Cause
this
shit's
getting
embarrassin'
The
fog
is
thick
and
the
air
is
thin
'Cause
he
won't
even
let
them
try
to
breathe
La-dididi-dadada-didi
He
makes
it
look
so
easy,
girl,
you
just
hit
the
lottery
Now
this'll
be
the
part
of
the
song
that
they
drop
the
needle
on
And
hell
breaks
loose
Try
to
restrain
us,
you
can't
contain
us
We're
still
gonna
make
a
stink
no
matter
what
we
do
Everywhere
we
go
it
seems,
we're
looking
for
any
excuse
To
just
cut
loose
So
this'll
be
the
part
of
the
song
that
they
drop
the
needle
on
And
hell
breaks
loose
This
is
when
shit
hits
the
fan
like
it
just
splattered
on
Stan
This
is
the
only
moment
that
matters
Your
homie
rolled
in
with
Mathers
Now
chaos
erupts,
Em's
in
back,
Dre's
in
the
front
So
do
what
we
say
at
once,
this
song’s
like
a
seance,
it
haunts
It
makes
them
stay
in
a
trance,
no
choice,
they
have
to
dance
It's
like
the
playoffs,
just
making
sure
that
we
stay
in
the
hunt
Take
a
day
off
of
what?
Man,
you
better
lay
off
the
blunts
You
must
be
smoking
something
You
think
I
ain't
smoking
nothing,
stay
off
my
nuts
Now
hit
the
floor,
baby,
time
to
wipe
away
all
the
rust
Shake
all
them
cobwebs
loose
Loosen
up
with
a
little
bit
of
Grey
Goose
Yeah,
girl,
shake
that
caboose
I
don't
wanna
see
you
try
to
make
no
excuse
D-R-E
is
on
the
loose
A
mongoose
when
it
comes
to
the
chronic
use
You
know
I
can't
stand
to
lose
Me
and
my
goons
are
like
animals
We
come
through
like
a
pack
of
wolves
And
we
came
here
to
retract
the
roof
Yeah,
man,
ain't
that
the
truth
Girl,
your
man's
back
in
the
booth
Definitely
back
up
in
this
bitch
And
this
is
when
all
hell
breaks
loose
Now
this'll
be
the
part
of
the
song
that
they
drop
the
needle
on
And
hell
breaks
loose
Try
to
restrain
us,
you
can't
contain
us
We're
still
gonna
make
a
stink
no
matter
what
we
do
Everywhere
we
go
it
seems,
we're
looking
for
any
excuse
To
just
cut
loose
So
this'll
be
the
part
of
the
song
that
they
drop
the
needle
on
And
hell
breaks
loose
Now
I
know
you're
feeling
discouraged
But,
homie,
just
mark
my
words
I'm
murderin'
the
flow,
liquid
courage,
I'm
fin'
to
blow
As
soon
as
we
hit
the
door,
power
surges
head
to
toe
I'm
sure
to
push
it
as
far
as
words
are
meant
to
go
We're
in
the
indigo
Winnebago
with
tinted
windows
Ferocious
as
we
proceed
to
beat
up
the
block
wit'
your
ho
With
speakers
knocking,
it's
3
o'clock
Me
and
Doc
then
proceed
to
drop
E
And
hop
out
the
vehicle
and
knock
on
your
door
Yeah,
so
let
us
in
'fore
we
huff
and
puff
and
we
blow
We
ain't
bluffing
for
nothing,
we'll
knock
the
stuffing
out
you
Revenge
is
so
sweet,
move
'til
you
injure
your
feet
Yeah,
move
it
or
lose
it,
freak,
move
to
the
beat
Lose
yourself
indubitably
Pass
up
on
that
little
cute
chick
right
there?
That'd
be
pretty
damn
stupid
to
me
Born
and
raised
in
the
CPT,
yeah,
Los
Angeles,
rules
of
the
streets
Them
haters
hatin'
on
me,
but
I
refuse
to
lose
any
sleep
Keep
that
deuce-deuce
in
the
seat
Dre
fall
off?
That's
news
to
me
Now
this'll
be
the
part
of
the
song
that
they
drop
the
needle
on
And
hell
breaks

Try

Ahh!
You

Somebody

Help!
Oh

Better

Who'da

Such

Blunt

"Mister

Help

is
what
he
said
to
me
and
then
sunk
Women,
skinning
them
and
cutting
them
up
in
chunks
In
comes
the
woman
with
cocoa
butter
skin,
once
Once
again,
they
call
me
Buffalo
Bill
Buffalo

Buffa-Buffalo

Skin

in
those
kilts
Up

those
kilts,
uppa-up
in
those
kilts
Man,

don't
want
to
go
up
in
those
hills
Up

hills
You
better
beware,
stay
clear
of
Buffalo
Bill
Buffalo
Bill,
Buffa-Buffalo
Bill
Always,
you
can
see
him
lurkin'
in
the
hallways
Carcasses
of
Caucasian
females
in
his
crawl
space
How
the
hell
did
he
fit
'em
all
into
such
a
small
place?
Hide
'em
in
the
wall,
well,
how
long
will
the
drywall
take?
Well,
fuck
it
then,
I
got
nothing
but
time,
I'll
wait
Until
it
dries,
for
the
moment,
I
guess
you're
all
safe
After
I
sand
it
and
buff
it,
I
guess
that
I'll
paint
My
chainsaw's
out
of
gas,
my
regular
saw
ain't
Now
here
I
come
again,
damn
stomach
rumbling
You
can
even
hear
the
evil
spirits
coming
from
within
Someone's
in
the
back
of
my
damn
house,
rummaging
It's
a
girl,
she
looks
pretty
thin,
but
I
want
her
skin
Vinn,
on
the
hunt
again,
when
will
it
ever
end?
Evelyn,
why
you
trying
to
fight?
You
will
never
win
Severin'
legs,
arms;
damn,
there
goes
another
limb
Pull
the
lever
then;
trap

Once

Cut

Man,

of
those
pills
Sedate
her,
then
I
wait,
I

later
Just-a
clutching

Blades,

I

I
fuckin'

I
keep
hearing
voices
like
"Wouldn't
ya
like
to
go
and
get
your
butcher
knife
And
push
it
right
through
her
While
you
put
ya
shish
kebab
skewers
into
her
Barbecue
her,
would
you
do
to
her
what
you
usually
do
To
a
girl
who's
skin's
newer?"
(In
a
world
of
sin
you
are,
this
is
turning
into
a
Torment
tournament
of
sorts,
Christmas
ornament
you
are)
I'll
be
sure
to
Ginsu
ya
'til
there's
no
more
skin
to
ya
Boo-yah!
Who

with?
Duck,
because
here
he

Once

Skin

All
aboard!
Okay,
next
stop,
my
basement
(Ha-ha)
I'll
meet
you
down
there!
There
once
was
a
saying
that
I
used
to
say
Back
in
the
day,
when
I
met
Dre
I
used
to
sit
and
goof
on
the
phone
with
my
friend
Proof
That
if
I
went
gold,
I'd
go
right
through
the
roof
He'd
say,
"What
if
you
went
platinum?",
I'd
just
laugh
at
him
"That's
not
happening,
that
I
can't
fathom"
Eighty-some
million
records
worldwide
later
I'm
living
in
a
house
with
a
fucking
elevator
Haters
getting
mad,
they
done
had
enough
of
Shady
You
slay
me,
nothing
you
say
matters
enough
to
touché
me
Rappers
try
to
play
me,
they
use
Hailie
as
a
ukulele
Whoopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
That’s
a
no-no,
even
she
knows
Da-Da's
fucking
crazy
Fucking
animal,
cuckoo,
bananas,
fucking-A,
B
Maybe
it's
because
I
never
had
a
mother
raise
me
Fuck
around
and
throw
a
baby
at
another
baby
You
may
think
it's
'cause
of
the
way
that
I
was
brought
up
But
it's
all
caught
up
to
me
now,
karma's
in
the
waters
Every
line
I
ever
said
has
got
me
in
a
corner
You
might
think
it
doesn't
creep
upon
ya,
but
it
all
does
You
wouldn't
listen,
man,
I
tried
to
warn
ya
when
you
started
Now
your
brain's
all
haunted
'cause
of
all
the
shit
you
thought
of
Chainsaw
slaughters,
turn
your
daughters
into
sawdust
I
never
thought
it'd
come
to
this,
I
oughta
just
be
honest,
but
There
once
was
a
saying
that
I
used
to
say
Back
in
the
day,
when
I

gold,
I'd
go
right
through
the
roof
He'd
say,
"What
if
you
went
platinum?",
I'd
just
laugh
at
him
"That's
not
happening,
that
I
can't
fathom"
Eighty-some
million
records

later
I'm
living
in
a
house
with
a
fucking
elevator
"Sorry
Lance,
Mr.
Lambert
and
Aiken
ain't
gonna
make
it
They
get
so
mad
when
I
call
them
both
faggots"
All
these
fucking
voices
in
my
head,
I
can't
take
it
Someone
shut
that
fucking
baby
up
'fore
I
shake
it
You're
standing
adjacent
to
Jason,
slash,
Leatherface,
and
Together
makes
'em
a
fucking
bad
combination
I
lashed
at
the
doctor
in
my
last
operation
Shoved
the
Wiener
Schnitzel
up
his
ass,
hopped
away,
some-

please
stop
the
patient,
get
the
cops
to
mace
him
Homie,
I'm
the
Scheiße,
ask
Doctor
Dreson
I
can't
leave
the
game,
I
just
can't
walk
away,
son
No,
not
a-now,
not
a
chance,
not
today,
son
I
can't
believe
I
leave
for
one
brief
second
And
you
pussies
queef
all
over
the
rap
game,
naked
And
use
a
leaf
to
wipe
up
the
crap
stain,
feck
it
I'll
just
keep
saying
the
same
exact
saying,
check
it
There
once
was
a
saying
that
I
used
to
say
Back
in
the
day,
when
I
met
Dre
I
used
to
sit
and
goof
on
the
phone
with
my
friend
Proof
That
if
I
went
gold,
I'd
go
right

the

Elevator
in
my
house,
hah,
smell
ya
later
I
blew
the
fuck
up,
a
hamster
in
the
microwave,
I'm
Thinking
'bout
an
escalator
now,
steps,
I
hate
'em
Told
the
neighbors
step
away,
then
I
just
pepper-sprayed
'em
Yeah,
for
every
time
you
ride
down
the
street
Or
hide
out,
drive
by
my
house
and
beep
Like,
now
motherfucker,
try
now
to
sleep
Lie
down

(bah),
try
counting
sheep
And
you're
tryna
find
out
why
now
there's
beef
Mace
in
your
face,
bitch,
cry
now,
pussy
This
is
my
house,
all
nine
thousand
feet
So
you
can
suck
my
dick
with
Amy
Winehouse's
teeth
Then
I
shove
'em
in
the
elevator,
take
'em
to
the
top
Stand
above
'em
just
to
cut
the
fucking
cable,
let
'em
drop
Walk
an
hour
to
the
damn
refrigerator,
get
a
pop
While
I
let
'em
fall
all
the
way
to
the
basement,
yelling
"Stop!"
There

Fucking-A,

To

Yeah,

Yo,

Man
Make
my

Come

It

a
diamond
up
my
hind
end
And
crush

with
my
butt
muscles
while
I
cut

Slut
poke

jump
in

puddles
While
I
stomp

let's
cuddle
Blood
curdlin',
you're
gurglin'
on
your
blood,
what'll
I
do
for
my
next
trick?
I'm
feelin'
wonderful
I
think
I
might
just
do
somethin'
a
little
less
subtle
Shove
a
fuckin'
Tonka
truck
up
a
little
kid's
butthole
Feel
the
wrath
of
a
psychopath
slash
ambassador
Of
the
Valentine's
Day
Massacre
slash
assassin
I
slash
her
in
the
ass
with
a
icicle
And
leave
her
layin'
a
blood
bath
while
I
Put
a
catheter
in
and
jump
in
the
bath
with
her
In
my
Spider-Man
mask,
man
Just
imagine
the
fun
I
can
have
with
a
strap-on
Stick
it
up
Kim
Kardashian's
ass
and
make
the
bitch
run
a
triathlon
Are
those
pistachios?
Damn,
I'd
like
to
have
some
Laying
on
the
patio,
man,
rolling
a
fat
one
Shady,
drop
the
magic
marker,
put
the
cap
on
Goddamn,
man,
are
you
that
much
of
an
asshole?
It
feels
so
wrong
'cause
it
feels

But
it's

it's
okay

eenie
weenie
between
each
One
of
my
thighs
and
make
it
disappear
like
a
genie
Make
the

disappear
like
Tara
Reid
in
a
bikini
Believe
me,
homie,
you
don't
know
the
meaning
of
a
meanie
They

the
fruit
loop
from
Jupiter
I'm
tryna
maneuver
the
Hoover
up

Don't

You

Totally
tubular,

tube
in
the
studio
Now

Wiener
smothered
in
peanut
butter,

ya
Eye
shadow
and
man,

looked
nice,
you

seen
it,
mother
I
think
I'll
put
a
piece
of
art
on
my
Visa
card
Then
I'll
go
beat
Mischa
Barton
with
a
Cuisinart
Then
mosey
on
over
to
Rosie
O'Donnell's
with
McDonald's
Jump
on
her
lap
and
watch
The
Sopranos
It
feels
so
wrong
'cause
it
feels
so
right
But
it's
all
right,
it's
okay
with

I'll

Shady,
what
are
you
doin'
chewin'
on
a
human?
Grab
an
aluminum
bat,
hit
Heidi
Klum
in
the
back,
boom!
And
assumin'
the
fact
that
that
dude's
in
the
back
room
Usin'
the
bathroom,
vacuumin'
a
raccoon
Skewin'
a
rat,
a
cat
screwin'
a
baboon
You
shouldn't
ask
what
is
he
doin'
with
that
broom
You
should
be
glad
he
ain't
leave
you
full
of
stab
wounds
You
in
a
trance,
I'm
back
doing
my
dance,
ooh
But
they're
afraid
I
might
get
Sarah
Palin
by
the
hair
And
make
her
wear
a
bathin'
suit
and
take
her
parasailin'
Shady,
why
do
you
gotta
pick
on
the
lady
for?
Why
you
make
her
read
84
bedtime
stories
to
you
in
baby
talk?
'Cause
I'm
scared
there's
monsters
under
my
bed
Kellie
Pickler
hid
my
juice
box
under
my
bassinet
No
wonder
my
ass
is
wet,
my
diaper
needs
to
be
changed
You
like
graffiti,
dyke?
Well,
I
can
pee-pee
and
write
your
name
It
feels
so
wrong
'cause
it
feels
so
right
But
it's
all
right,
it's
okay
with
me
I'll
do
my

So
I'm
taking

and
going

home
Fine,
nobody
wants
to
play
with
me?
Fuck
you
then,
bitch!
You
guys
are
always
mean
to
me
anyways
All
you
ever
do
is
rub
gum
in
my
hair
and
stuff
You
guys
are
gonna
make
me...
make
me
sad,
I'm
sad
I'm
gonna
cry...
I'm
crying
I'm
going
to
tell
my
mom...
Mom!
Yeah
Yeah,
girl
Can
you
hear
that?
It's
playing
our
song
Are
you
sleepy?
Take
a
nap
You're
not
afraid
of
the
dark,
are
you?
You
hear
the
beat
as
it
makes
ya
not
want
to
go
to
sleep
I
knock
on
Dakota's
door;
it's
locked,
so
I
go
to
creep
'Round
the
back
with
binoculars,
not
'cause
I
wanna
peep
But
because
I'm
hungry,
she
smells
like
tacos,
I
wanna
eat
Visions
of
hot
chocolaty
marshmallows,
all
so
sweet
With
sugar
plums;
oh,
look
Here
comes
Marshall,
he's
on
your
street
He's
placing
hot,
smoldering
charcoals
beneath
your
feet
Now
walk
on
'em;
he's
dancing
with
carcasses
cheek
to
cheek
Like
a
Thanksgiving
turkey,
a
holiday
ham
Cinnamon
sprinkled
on
toast,
strawberry
marmalade
jam
Flavor
my
favorite
graham
crackers
with
JonBenét
Rams'
I
guess
a
modern-day
Jack
the
Ripper
is
all
that
I
am
(My
music
box)
'Cause
when
the
lights
are
off,
I
see
the
girl's
asleep
(My
music
box)
But
I
can
hear
you,
my
love,
you
keep
calling
me
(My
music
box)
Although
we're
worlds
apart,
you
mean
the
world
to
me
(My
music
box,
my
music
box)
So
once
you
call,
I
come,
I
will
answer
(My
music
box)
'Cause
when
the
lights
are
off,
I
see
the
girl's
asleep
(My
music
box)
I
hear
my
music
box
playing
a
song
for
me
(My
music
box)
So
won't
you
twirl
around
and
do
a
whirl
for
me?
(My
music
box,
my
music
box)
And
would
you
be
my
private
little
dancer?
I
almost
look
comatose;
who
wants
to
be
sober?
Gross
I
foam
like
a
Doberman,
mouth
open,
I
overdose
Put
coke
up
my
nostrils
in
both
my
holes,
then
I
plug
my
nose
My
pupils
quadruple
in
size,
eyes
are
so
bugged,
I
know
I
put
on
my
mother's
makeup,
get
naked
and
run
around
Wavin'
the
gun
around,
I
think
I'm
down
to
a
hundred
pounds
There's
thunder,
I
wonder
how
come
it
rains,
but
the
sun
is
out?
The
devil's
upset
with
his
wife,
they
must
be
sluggin'
it
out
I
must
be
buggin'
the
fuck
out,
but
what
the
fuck
about?
Voices
are
leading
me
up
to
the
attic,
I
love
my
house
They
pull
and
they
tug
my
blouse,
the
sound
of
a
music
box
Comes
from
inside
a
toy
chest,
but
what
do
I
do?
It's
locked
I
pick
it
and
open
it,
but
it's
stuffed
full
of
human
parts
I
dig
'til
I
find
it,
I
wind
it
up,
and
the
tune
just
starts
It's
playing
a
song,
so
beautiful,
and
the
room
is
dark
The
moon
is
full,
I
smell
a
funeral,
guess
I'll
loom
in
the
park
(My
music
box)
'Cause
when
the
lights
are
off,
I
see
the
girl's
asleep
(My
music
box)
But
I
can
hear
you,
my
love,
you
keep
calling
me
(My

Although
we're

So
once

I

'Cause

for
me
(My
music
box)
So
won't
you
twirl
around
and
do
a
whirl
for
me?
(My
music
box,
my
music
box)
And
would
you
be
my
private
little
dancer?
I'm
fixated
on
asphyxiatin'
and
breakin'
This
little
chick's
neck
like
a
Pixy
Stick
The
sick,
Satan-worshippin'
bitches
get
horse
whippings
I'm
in
the
back,
through
the
back
door
slippin'
Through
the
crack,
leavin'
the
corpse
drippin'
The
mortician
of
love,
sent
from
above
Forced
entry,
the
more
wenchy
the
more
stingy
I
become
Been
doing
this
for
more
than
a
quarter-century,
I'm
just
numb
Am
I
dreaming,
is
it
real?
Someone
pinch
me
on
the
buns
The
time
has
come
to
tie
her
up,
gotta
roll
me
the
ladder
I've
had
enough
of
the
chatter
Climb
up
to
the
window,
look
at
her
Then
climb
in
slow
to
shatter
her
brain
matter
and
batter
her
With
a
bat;
a
matter
of
fact,
that
will
splatter
her
But
before
I
do
that,
I'll
have
a
chat
to
flatter
her
Give
her
two
compliments
back
to
back,
like
"Tabitha
I'm
your
secret
admirer,
I'm
back
to
ravish
ya
So
strong
is
your
fight,
but
you're
no
match
for
Dracula"
Prolonging
her
plight
as
I
go
back
to
stabbin'
her
Dismember
her
limbs,
simple
as
that:
cadaver
her
Zoom
in
with
the
lens,
then
pan
back
the
camera
Stand
back,
'cause
here
comes
your
man
Jack,
so
Pamela
(My
music
box)
'Cause
when
the
lights
are
off,
I
see
the
girl's
asleep
(My
music
box)
But
I
can
hear
you,
my
love,
you
keep
calling
me
(My
music
box)
Although
we're
worlds
apart,
you
mean
the
world
to
me
(My
music
box,
my
music
box)
So
once
you
call,
I
come,
I
will
answer
(My
music
box)
'Cause
when
the
lights
are
off,
I
see
the
girl's
asleep
(My
music
box)
I
hear
my
music
box
playing
a
song
for
me
(My
music
box)
So
won't
you
twirl
around
and
do
a
whirl
for
me?
(My
music
box,
my
music
box)
And
would
you
be
my
private
little
dancer?
Yeah,

Them

the
alarm,

Buh!
Buh-Buh!

I'm
'bout

Beirut
in

So,
hey,
wouldn't
you
say
I'm

Couldn't

Yeah,
look
If
I
were
to
rap
about
the
crap
that's
out
That's
the
route
you
probably
want
me
to
take
‘Cause
you're
just
dyin'
to
know
what
I
think
Hear
my
take
on
some
other
rappers
If
I
was
to
say
somethin'
about
Paul
Wall
You'd
probably
crap
in
your
pants,
‘cause
I'm
white
and
he's
white
So
he's
like
my
competition,
I
mean,
right?
Nope!
Paul
Wall
is
dope,
and
so
is
Bubba
So
b-b-b-b-b-b,
but
I
don't
compete
with
nobody
I
just
go
hard,
do
the
rope-a-dope
Ali
shuffle
And
dance
around
my
opponents,
do
donuts
Sometimes
I
play
possum,
like
I'm
asleep,
it's
awesome
I'm
like
a
sleepin'
giant,
and
when
I
awake
I'm
like
Dre
I
just
jump
from
outta
nowhere
and
bite
prey
And
sink
my
teeth
in
'em,
and
fill
'em
Full
of
poison,
and
make
a
noise
like
a
snake
before
I
kill
'em
And
let
'em
know
that
I
just
don't
feel
'em
And
smack
'em
with
the
backward
E,
the
Eminem
emblem
I
was
taught
if
you
gonna
murder
somebody
you
should
face
him
Tell
him
why,
look
him
dead
in
the
eye,
then
waste
him
And
the
dark
shall
emerge
from
the
fiery
depths
of
hell
Then
swallow
the
shell,
all
the
hollow
who
dwell
In
the
shadows
of
all
who
are
willing
to
sell
their
souls
For
this
rap
game
and
it
g-g-goes
One-two-three,
chk-chk,
one-two-three
Chk-chk,
one-two-three,
that
ain't
the
hook,
now
follow
me
There's
nothing
else
for
me
to
say,
my
public
adores
me
Everybody
bores
me,
they're
just
so
corny
So
at
night
before
I
sleep,
I
look
in
the
mirror
The
mirror
grows
lips
and
it
whispers:
"Come
nearer!"

told

St.
Tropez,
but
your
man
don't
lay
In
the
sun
'cause
I
don't
tan,
I
burn,
blood
clot
When
you
gonna
learn
how
much
money
we've
earned?
How
does
it
feel
to
know
I
came
in
this
game
at
25
And
coulda
retired
at
29
in
my
20's
still?
And
Fif'
hit
a
lick
on
that
Coca-Cola
shit
He
ain't
even
got
to
look
at
coke
to
even
hold
a
brick
No
more,
oh
boy,
goddamn
did
he
score
To
go
from
sellin'
bags
to
bottles
right
out
the
store
And
Shady
hit
the
box
office
man,
he
knocked
the
socks
off
us
My
ex-wife
is
set
for
life,
you
profitless
cocksuckers
So
stay
the
fuck
off
us,
we
make
pay
I'm
just
a
super
easy
modest
MC,
okay?
'Til
I
hear
the
word
has
been,
that's
when
I
start
spazzin'
Smart
asses,
kiss
a
smarter
ass
then
I'm
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
rap,
bastards
I'm
a
blonde
Dre,
now
gimme
Kanye's
glasses
CDs
ain't
selling
no
more
anyways,
man
Look
at
SoundScan
I
really
don't
think
it
matters
if
Everything
I
do
is
number
one,
that
makes
you
two
And
that
spells
trouble
for
me
and
you
'Cause
that's
how
beef
starts
between
crews
And
I
don't
mind
if
I
debut
at
number
two
So
why
do
you?
If
we
make
money
Then
why
can't
you
be
satisfied
with
what
you
do?
It's
like
our
legacy's
pregnant,
we're
planting
eggs
every
record
They're
beggin'
me
to
release
a
CD
every
other
second
But
don't
expect
it,
'cause
every
time
I
get
hit
with
that
question
I
just
deflect
it,
get
Ca$his
or
50's
record
and
check
it
And
Buck
is
out,
like
get
these
motherfuckers
out
'fore
I
smack
'em
Plus
T.I.
just
dropped
an
album
now,
go
out
and
get
that
one
And
I
got
a
whole
stable
of
artists
who's
able
and
fully
capable
Of
holdin'
a
label
'til
I
figure
out
when
I'm
ready
to
drop
You
were
pop,
you
were
so
popular,
now
you're
not
You're
a
washed
up
entrepreneur,
how's
it
possible?
Well,
it's
not,
if
your
little
fickle
minds
would've
caught
on,
but
you
didn't
See,
I
don't
rap
for
the
green,
I
mean,
I
ain't
greedy
But
I
also
know
what
it's
like
to
be
needy,
and
I
will
never
Go
back
to
poverty,
see,
it
ain't
easy
to
try
to
step
Away
from
entertainment,
separate
it
from
CDs
And
every
day
it
just
seems
like
we're
beefin',
even
the
media's
Meat
eaters,
they
gotta
give
you
something
to
read
Or
you
won't
buy
it,
believe
what
you
wanna
believe
Let
'em
feed
to
you,
the
BS,
P.S.,
peace
to
T.I
You
gon
be
'aight
and
we
out
Everything
I
do
is
number
one,
that
makes
you
two
And
that
spells
trouble
for
me
and
you
'Cause
that's
how
beef
starts
between
crews
And
I
don't
mind
if
I
debut
at
number
two
So
why
do
you?
If
we
make
money
Then
why
can't
you
be
satisfied
with
what
you
do?
Peace
Hold
a
head
up,
partner
You
know
how
we
do
what
we
gonna
do
When
we
do
it
and
we
don't
give
a
fuck
what
you're
doin'
We
gon'
touchdown,
back
up
in
the
private
charter
plane
We
gon'
touchdown,
you
know
we
gon'
get
it
crackin'
man
We
gon'
touchdown,
I
told
you
ain't
no
way
to
keep
'em
quiet
With
T.I.
and
Shady,
baby,
they
gon'
make
a
bigger
riot
When
we
touchdown
I
cut
back
on
the
syllables
just
a
little
But
still
I
feel
I
should
kill
a
few
just
to
show
that
still
I
do
Put
forth
an
effort,
one
foot
forward,
thank
heavens
and
good
lord
Whoever
would've
thought
that
my
umbilical
cord
Would've
been
c-c-cut
from
the
s-same
cloth
There's
no
other
name,
just
be
thankful
that
I
came
forth
Tip
it
the
same,
whether
it's
boiled
or
flame
broiled
You
say
my
name,
you
bet
that
ass
you
gon'
pay
for
it
Just
the
respect
is
not
the
crown
that
I
came
for
But
if
you
feel
like
passin'
it
around,
well
then,
Jay,
throw
it
'Cause
we
all
go
straight
to
it
and
if
not,
I
just
wait
for
it
That
other
skateboard,
got
a
couple
of
scrapes
for
it
Get
a
bandana
on,
stuck
in
this
drug,
but
I'll
get
up
out
it
I
always
do,
I
ain't
gon'
sit
here
and
argue
about
it
I
can't
hop
out
of
that
gutter,
I
just
crawl
through
up
out
it
I'm
back,
I'm
sorry,
I
feel
awful
about
it
You
probably
gonna
think
that
I'm
talking
About
you
and
you're
goddamn
right,
I
am
Look
at
you,
this
is
the
minimal
I
could
diss
you
Subliminally,
but
I
think
criminal
instinct
Has
pushed
me
to
the
brink,
"My
pussy
does
it
stink
He
still
loves
me
'cause
he
puts
me
in
his
ink
He
does,
doesn't
he?
Still
is,
isn't
he?
Nah,
I'm
just
playing
tug
of
war
with
his
heart
'cause
he
misses
me
I
can
still
fuck
him
and
leave
him
whenever
I
feel
frisky
And
there's
no
risk
of
disease
'cause
he
ain't
with
anyone,
is
he?"
This
bitch
really
thinks
she
can
get
me
If
she
still
wants
me,
driving
across
country
Strapped
up
to
the
front
seat,
missing
all
her
front
teeth
Thinking
to
herself
"when's
the
next
time
he's
gonna
punch
me?"
I
told
this
cunt
she's
gonna
overdo
it
once
And
once
she
does,
she'll
be
stuffed
up
in
a
trunk
Crunchy,
scrunched
her
up
in
a
ball
Bunched
up
nice
and
comfy
Fuck
around
get
dumped
up
in
a
lake
'fore
you
dump
me
You
cunning
little
cunt,
deceitful
witch
You
thought
you
had
me,
'till
my
shrink
told
me
this
The
problem
is
all
inside
your
head
she
said
to
me
The
answer
is
easy
if
you
take
it
logically
I'd
like
to
help
you
in
your
struggle

be
free
There
must
be
50
ways

leave
your
lover
I
feel
like
a
serial
killer,
I
keep
dumping
bodies
in
the
lake
I'mma
get
caught
and
sent
up
the
river
I
shiver
when
I
think
of
the
company
I
keep
How
do
I
know
she
ain't
gonna
kill
me
when
I
sleep?
I
shriek,
every
time
she
hands
me
something
to
drink
Sex
kept
us
together
when
we
slept
together
everything
Was
all
better,
she
made
me
feel
like
a
king
Slowly
she
began
lowering
my
self-esteem
She'd
go
to
the
club
and
not
answer
the
phone
when
I
call
her
And
I
just
bought
her
a
truck
for
50,000
dollars
Accused
me
of
doing
drugs
and
scream
and
holla
Then
I
find
a
bag
of
coke
on
her,
some
marijuana
And
all
I
know
is
every
time
I
go
To
them
hiding
spots,
wherever
she
hides
her
blow
The
little
bags
of
dope,
there
was
a
pile
of
coke
That's
growing
smaller,
and
that
was
just
a
while
ago
And
I
wouldn't
even
let
on
like
I
know
What
was
I
supposed
to
do?
Call
her
out
on
it,
we'd
just
argue
Say
she
put
it
there
on
purpose
and
flipped
the
whole
script
Ooh!
She's
a
manipulative
evil
bitch
A
cunning
little
cunt,
little
deceitful
witch
She
thought
she
had
me,
'till
my
shrink
told
me

The

My
name
is
Chauncey
Billups,
I'm
kind
of
like
a
raunchy
Phillips
Screwdriver,
my
crew's
liver
when
you
can't
sleep
and
you're
still
up
I
get
the
ball
and
I'm
like
Rip,
you
can't
get
a
grip
You
probably
got
stripped,
you
wanna
rumble,
no
reason
to
trip
I
grab
her
like
Gnarls
Barkley
holds
the
mic,
your
snarls
spark
me
I
smile
like
Charles
Barkley

Ain’t

and
your
life
is
ruined
I'm

Rasheed,
I

me
the
spirit
of
Proof
I'm
happy
and
lucky,
ballin'
and
groovin',
I'm
on
the

I'm
smooth
with
it,
give
me
the
ball,
you
don't

what
to
do
with
it
Shoot

the
basket,
you
other
teams
need
a
casket
LeBron
sayin'
don't
respond,
there's
no
back
and
forth
This
game
is
mental,
man,
I
play
aloud
and
walk
away
just
to
hush
the
crowd
You

Sit

Tracy,
I
joined
this
class
cuz
I
thought
I’d
be
cooking
with
a
partner
But
she’s
never
here,
and
I
don’t
get
twice
the
credit
for
all
the
work
I
didn't
invent
odd
numbers
Seth
I
know,
but
I’m
over
here
in
my
unit,
every
day,
cooking
my
terrible-tasting
food,
and
then
I
gotta
look
over
at
Evan,
I
mean
look
at
him,
it
looks
like
the
most
fun
I’ve
ever
seen
in
my
entire
life.
And,
I’m
just
saying,
I
wash
and
dry,
I’m
like
a
single
mother.
And,
no
offense
but,
everyone
takes
this
class
to
get
an
A
and
it’s
bullshit,
but
uh
no
offense,
I’m
just
saying.
And
I’m
not
putting
down
your
profession,
but
when
am
I
gonna
need
to
cook
tiramisu?
Am
I
gonna
be
a
chef?
No.
There’s
3
weeks
left
in
school,
give
me
a
freaking
break,
sorry
for
cursing.
OH
MY
GOD
that’s
like
the
coolest
fucking
story
I’ve
ever
heard
in
my
life,
it’s
insane.
Can
you
tell
us
again?
Do
you
have
time?
Tracy,
Tracy,
can
you
hear
me?
I’m
in
the
car
right
now.
Listen,
I
am
McLovin,
yeah.
McLovin
in
the
house!
McLovin
in
the
house!
Yeah
It
is
not
about
lyrics
anymore
It’s
about
a
hot
beat
and
a
catchy
hook
If
we
gotta
dumb
down
our
style
and
A-B-C
it
Then
so
be
it,
‘cause
nowadays
these
kids,
geez
Don’t
give
a
shit
'bout
lyrics
All
they
wanna
hear
is
a
beat
and
that's
it
Long
as
they
can
go
to
the
club
and
get
blitzed
Pick
up
some
chicks
and
get
some
digits
And
the
DJ's
playin'
them
hits
"Oh,
this
my
jam!
This
my
shit!
We
don't
know
a
word
to
a
verse,
all
we
know
is
the
chorus
‘Cause
the
chorus
repeats
the
same
four
words
for
us
And
the
song's
ginormous,
the
whole
formula’s
switched
‘Cause
we
don’t
know
anymore
what
are
hits"
Is
it
the
beat?
Is
it
the
rap?
Is
it
a
finger
snap
or
the
same
808
clap?
And
how
do
we
adapt
and
get
TRL
votes
When
13-year-olds
control
the
remotes?
And
Ashlee's
got
a
brand
new
nose
We
gotta
put
some
new
em-pha-sis
on
our
syl-la-la-bles
If
the
emphasis
on
the
compact
disc
Is
in
the
beat,
then
I’m
gon'
feature
Em
and
get
rich
And
let
Dre
mix
the
shit
and
drive
off
in
the
Range
Ro'
‘Cause
everywhere
I
go
they
love
the
"bling
bling"
flow
Bang
bang,
look
at
the
way
my
chain
glow
The
ring
on
my
fing’
cost
your
man
a
lot
of
dough
Oh,
the
fuck
am
I
bustin'
my
brain
fo'?
It's
just
the
way
the
game
go,
oh,
it
takes
two
to
tango
You
call
this
a
lame
flow?
You
bought
the
shit
I
guess
you
to
blame,
too,
I
just
found
an
angle
No
more
reality
flow
I’m
tryna
time
my
album
droppin'
with
a
reality
show
Cock
the
MAC-11
in
front
of
Hot
97
And
call
my
publicist,
tell
her
we
in
press
heaven
No
one
gives
a
shit
except
some
kids
That
just
got
into
sex
on
the
Internet
So
you
want
the
chat
room
or
the
house
in
Malibu,
Em?
Your
emphasis
is
on
the
wrong
syl-la-la-ble
They
said
30's
the
new
20
Funny,
must
mean
40's
the
new
30,
interesting
'Cause
ever
since
then
it's
been
in
a
sense
an
extension
For
veteran
rappers
that
are
better
than
half
Of
the
shit
coming
out
right
now,
it's
all
trash
The
torch
is
gonna
burn
out
before
it
gets
passed
Jay
said
it’s
his
last,
then
50
and
Em
Then
what?
Detox
drops,
what
do
we
got
then?
So
now
our
whole
camps
is
running
around
Scramblin'
over
what
to
do
Gamblin',
and
every
time
we
put
a
record
out
Just
lookin'
for
that
hook
(Wait,
Dre,
look!)
Shorty,
I
love
you
And
you
love
me

We
were
meant

And
I
love
you
too
And
I
promise
I’ll
be
true
to
you
Go
shorty,
it's
your
birthday
You
made
it
just
in
time
to

my
wordplay
It's

used
to
flip
O's
And
run

how
I
get

Don’t

You

And

Fallin'

All

'Fore
the

of

is
gone
with
a
snap
A

a

just
spittin'
About

In

I

King
Mathers

me,
that's

I'm

It's

of
the

deep
in
the

I
speak
with
a

no

No

I'm
a
little
nutty
and
I
know
it
but
if
you
go
back
and
take
a
look
at
my
history
You
will
see
that
I
am
not
the
only
one
who's
off
his
rocker,
there
were
many
before
me
I
was
always
labeled
the
black
sheep
of
the
family,
what
a
bad
seed
I'd
grow
to
be
But
if
you
take
a
look
at
us
now
you'll
see
the
apple
didn't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
Alright
look,
I'mma
tell
you
the
story
from
my
side
Maybe
you'll
understand,
check
it
out
You
done
witnessed
unexplainable
shit
Too
insane
to
explain,
people
run
from
what
they
just
don't
get
Maybe
Shady
should
have
just
hit
'em
with
a
little
bit
Did
I
spit
too
soon?
Should
I
have
spoon
fed
'em
it?
But
I
was
just
so
eager
to
prove
I
was
even
Worth
bein'
in
the
same
league
or
the
room
Of
the
people
of
whom
I
was
in
Every
now
and
then,
I
look
up
like
I
was
seekin'
approval
Was
it
because
of
the
pigment
of
my
skin?
Or
was
it
a
figment
of
my
imagination?
Maybe
it
bothered
me
more
than
it
did
them
Maybe
it
wasn't
a
big
deal
back
then
But
to
me
it
was,
see
what
it
was
Was
I
had
developed
a
complex
from
being
judged
Proof
spit
his
verse,
now
I'm
next,
let's
see
who
balks
I'm
in
the
booth
staring
back
to
see
whose
mugs
I
get
a
reaction
from,
usually
the
first
thumb
Was
from
Proof
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
backed
him
up
And
no
one
lied
to
each
other
'cause
none
of
us
had
deals
It
was
real,
we
just
wanted
tickets
for
that
meal
Sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
I
said
sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
Ever
since
my
mother
was
pregnant
with
a
second
egg
'Cause
she
said
that
I
had
a
baby
sister
Who
fell
outta
the
window,
I
was
too
young
to
remember
Kansas
City
projects,
I
was
like
5-6
And
how
come,
I
remember
Malcolm,
Isaac,
and
Boogy
If
it
was
the
projects
in
Missouri?
'Cause
those
were
my
best
friends
until
Isaac
Took
my
tricycle
and
my
Uncle
Todd
went
to
try
to
go
get
it
back
And
ended
up
gettin'
jumped
and
cut
in
the
gut
With
a
switch
and
70
some
stitches
Which
is,
to
this
day,
why
my
mother
still
tries
to
show
me
Some
old
fake
pictures
Of
a
fictitious
little
sister
who
never
existed
And
this
is
why
part
of
my
life's
so
twisted
But
I
can
never
be
as
sick
as
that
bitch
is
And
by
the
way,
that
bitch
is
one
of
my
relatives
Sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
I
said
sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
You
probably
have
to
peel
back
layers
upon
layers
of
pain
To
see
why
everything
I
say
is
so
insane
What's
different
about
my
brain
That
separates
me
from
other
players
in
this
game?
On
the
surface
it
may
seem
like
a
scheme
Or
some
sort
of
scam
for
me
to
get
some
damn
sympathy
But
that's
the
last
thing
I
need
Is
for
people
to
walk
around
feelin'
sorry
for
me
And
I
am
not
a
G,
never
claimed
to
be
I
gave
my
vest
to
Cashis,
just
hope
he
don't
need
it
more
than
me
But
we'll
see,
'cause
we
ain't
lookin'
for
beef
But
if
it
comes
our
way,
what
do
we
turn
the
other
cheek?
Come
on
Sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a
look
at
my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
I
said
sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
goin'
crazy
But
take
a

my
family
'Cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
Yeah,
and
I'm
the
crazy
one
right?
Whatever,
then
let
me
be
the
crazy
one!
Balalalalalalalalalala
Cuckoo,
cuckoo,
tweet
And
I’m
willing
to
borrow
your
grass
But
I
specialize
in
eating
MC's
In
the
immortal
words
of
LL
Cool
J
As
he
would
say:
"I'm
a
G.O.A.T.!"
And
for
those
of
y'all
who
don't
know
what
a
G.O.A.T.
is
It
means
the
Greatest
Of
All
Time
And
I
consider
myself
one
of
those
So
thank
you
very
much,
here
it
goes
This
is
the
part
I
was
worried
about
Everyone
thinks
that
my
career
is
down
the
tubes
And
I'm
in
some
dusty
garage
Inhalin'
them
carbon
monoxide
fumes
And
everyone's
tellin'
me
what
I
should
do
And
how
I
should
come
out
and
what
to
rap
about
And
I
know
I
got
a
lot
up
In
my
medulla
oblongata
that
I
gotta
get
out
And
I'm
not
sure
how
this
is
gonna
come
off
They're
probably
gonna
think
that
I'm
comin'
off
as
cocky
Like
I
just
started
givin'
a
fuck
what
you
really
think
about
me
See,
the
thing
about
me
Is
you
don't
really
know
a
thing
about
me
Everyone's
makin'
a
stink
about
me
Like
there's
some
kind
of
an
aura
of
that
of
the
king
around
me
Surround
me
with
nothin'
but
gangsters
Killers
and
bangers
and
the
most
dangerous
criminals
And
I
feel
like
I'm
more
comfortable
around
them
Than
I
do
my
own
motherfuckin'
neighbors
But
see,
my
dream
is
to
be
remembered
as
one
of
the
best
when
I
leave
But
why
does
it
seem
like
I'm
not
even
put
up
in
the
same
category
as
other
MC's?
So
when
Weezy
says
that
he's
better
than
Jay
Z
Please
be
that
just
subliminally
Means
he
thinks
Jigga's
the
best
And
that
he's
the
only
one
up
in
that
league,
see
And
it's
easy
just
to
consider
me
One
of
the
greatest
white
rappers
there
is
Knowin'
goddamn
well
that
I'm
one
of
the
best
motherfuckin'
rappers
who
ever
lived,
period
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
and
I
don't
mean
to
gloat
But
I
know
what
I
know
and
I
know
what
you
think
And
these
magazines'll
never
put
it
in
ink
Because
how
would
it
look
if
they
considered
me
as
a
G.O.A.T.?
And
for
those
of
y'all
who
don't
know
what
a
G.O.A.T.
is
It
means
the
Greatest
Of
All
Time
And
I
consider
myself
one
of
those
So
thank
you
very
much,
here
it
goes
Maybe
they
figure
that
I'm
on
my
way
out
the
game
So
they
gotta
go
try
to
find
'em
a
new
Eminem
or
a
new
Shady
If
they
think
it's
gonna
happen,
man,
I
thought
I
was
crazy
Or
maybe
I
could
be
takin'
it
wrong
And
they're
tryna
pay
homage
to
me
in
a
strange
way
So
let
me
pay
homage
to
my
fellow
white
competitors
almost
in
the
same
way
See,
you
hardly
ever
do
hear
anyone
even
bringin'
up
that
Paul
Wall's
white
‘Cause
lyrically
he
doesn't
pose
a
threat
to
anyone,
see,
he's
just
aight
And
Bubba
Sparxxx,
he
just
won't
write
Because
he's
so
caught
up
in
that
snow
white
That
Timbaland
can't
even
get
him
in
the
studio
He's
so
gone
off
that
coke,
right?
And
it's
so
sad
‘cause
he's
dope,
right?
America's
next
great
white
hope,
right?
So
now
they
feel
like
they
gotta
come
up
with
some
corny-ass
White
Rapper
Show,
right?
And
which
I'm
still
havin'
mixed
feelings
about
They
said
it'd
be
real,
I'm
just
spillin'
it
out
There's
somethin'
about
a
white
boy
talkin'
black
And
runnin'
around
with
a
damn
grill
in
his
mouth
And
I
love
when
the
say
that
Tiger
Woods
shit
"Isn't
it
ironic
that
the
best
rapper's
white
And
the
best
golfer's
black?"
And
I'm
the
one
who's
gotta
catch
all
the
flack
off
of
that
But
these
are
the
people
who
never
had
heard
of
an
Eminem
until
8
Mile
had
came
out
But
I
had
already
hit
middle
America
Parents
had
all
got
to
likin'
me
now
When
suddenly
I
wasn't
such
a
bad
guy
All
of
the
hatred
for
me
must've
died
Thought
I
committed
career
suicide
So
I
had
to
turn
back
into
the
bad
guy
So
faggoty
faggoty
faggoty
gays
Anatomy
God
made
Raggedy
Ann
and
Andy
Not
Raggedy
Andy
and
Andy
and
Andy
And
Angelina
Jolie
is
just
another
ho
And
Brad
is
a
sucka,
because
once
I
fuck
her
She
wants
to
go
to
Somalia
to
adopt
another
baby
You
know
what
I
say?
—
"No."
You
better
save
some
of
them
kids
from
Madonna
She
needs
all
the
publicity
she
can
get
You
wanted
Shady,
well
you
got
it,
man,
I
ain't
apologizin'
for
shit
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
and
I
don't
mean
to
gloat
But
I
know
what
I
know
and
I
know
what
you
think
And
these
magazines'll
never
put
it
in
ink
Because
how
would
it
look
If
they
considered
me
as
a
G.O.A.T.?
And
for
those
of
y'all
who
don't
know
what
a
G.O.A.T.
is
It
means
the
Greatest
Of
All
Time
And
I
consider
myself
one
of
those
So
thank
you
very
much,
here
it
goes
Man,
I'm
takin'
my
ball
and
goin'
home
Man,
shit
is
too
easy
Nobody
even
wants
to
pass
me
the
ball
‘Cause
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
So
don't
worry,
I'm
out
the
motherfuckin'
game
And
y'all
can
sit
and
argue
about
who's
the
motherfuckin'
best
But
y'all
know
that
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
And
like
I
said,
I'm
one
of
the
motherfuckin'
best
Before
you
get
your
panties
in
a
motherfuckin'
bunch
But
before
I
go,
I'd
like
to
say
fuck
you
very
much
To
everybody
who
wasn't
there
from
the
start
And
thank
you
very
much
to
everybody
who
was
And
y'all
ain't
gotta
say
it,
just
think
it
‘Cause
I
know
that
you
know
that
I
know
That
you
know
that
I
know
that
I'm
a
G.O.A.T.
I'm
out
y'all,
it's
been
real—peace!
They
ask
me
am
I
okay,
they
ask
me
if
I'm
happy
Are
they
asking
me
that
because
of
the
shit
that's
been
thrown
at
me?
Or
am
I
just
a
little
snappy
and
they
genuinely
care?
Doody,
most
of
my
life
it's
just
been
me
and
you
there
And
I
continuously
stare
at
pictures
of
you
I
never
got
to
say
I
love
you
as
much
as
I
wanted
to,
but
I
do
Yeah,
I
say
it
now
when
you
can't
hear
me
What
the
fuck
good
does
that
do
me
now?
But
somehow
I
know
you're
near
me
in
presence
Oh,
I
went
and
dropped
some
presents
off
for
Easter
To
them
two
little
beautiful
boys
of
yours
to
try
to
ease
their
Minds
a
little,
and
dog,
you'll
never
believe
this
But
Sharonda
actually
talks
to
me
now—Jesus!
And
everyone
else
is
just
tryin'
to
pick
up
the
pieces
Man,
how
could
you
touch
so
many
fuckin'
lives
and
just
leave
us?
They
say
grievance
has
a
way
of
affectin'
everyone
different
If
it's
true,
how
the
fuck
I'm
s'posed
to
get
over
you?
Difficult
as
it
sounds
Doody,
I
drop
a
tear
in
a
rhyme
The
day
you
find
it
is
the
day
I
stop
missin'
DeShaun
Holton,
it
was
written,
it
was
woven
For
a
soldier
to
leave
so
suddenly,
got
me
wide
open
How
could
God
take
a
soul
so
dope
and
Turn
around,
leave
us
all
heartbroken?
Know
that
you're
sayin',
"Keep
goin'!
Be
a
man!
No
emotion!
It's
your
duty!"
Until
we
meet
again,
Doody
"Doody,"
that's
what
we'd
call
each
other
I
don't
know
where
it
came
from
But
it
just
stuck
with
us,
we
was
always
brothers
Never
thought
about
each
other's
skin
colors
'Til
one
day
we
was
walkin'
up
the
block
in
the
summer
It
was
like
90
degrees,
I
was
catchin'
a
sunburn
Tryin'
to
walk
under
the
trees
just
to
give
me
some
comfort
I'm
moanin',
I
just
wanna
get
home
and
I
look
over
and
your
shirt
is
off
I'm
like,
"You're
gonna
fry,"
you're
like,
"No,
I
won't
I'm
black,
stupid!
And
black
people
they
got
melatonin
In
their
skin—we
don’t
burn,"
meanwhile
my
face
is
glowin'
And
I
feel
like
I'm
on
fire
And
the
entire
time
you're
just
laughin'
at
me
And
snappin'
at
me
with
your
shirt,
bastard
And
I
still
have
to
get
you
back
for
that
shit
And
by
the
way,
them
Playboy
rings
my
mother
stole
from
you
Well,
Nate
finally
got
'em
back,
shit
It
must've
been
at
least
sixteen
years
ago
Well,
I
put
'em
in
your
cask—oww
Movin'
past
it,
it
still
ain't
registered
yet
But
you
can
bet,
your
legacy
they'll
never
forget
The
Motor
City,
Motown,
hip
hop
vet
Hip
Hop
Shop,
dreads,
it
don't
stop
there
Yeah,
as
difficult
as
it
sounds
Doody,
I
drop
a
tear
in
a
rhyme
The
day
you
find
it

the

How
could
God
take
a
soul
so
dope
and
Turn
around,
leave
us
all
heartbroken?
Know
that
you're
sayin',
"Keep
goin'!
Be
a
man!
No
emotion!
It's
your
duty!"
Until
we
meet
again,
Doody
And
this
might
sound
a
little
strange
but
I'ma
tell
it
I
found
that
jacket
that
you
left
at
my
wedding
And
I
picked
it
up
to
smell
it
I
wrapped
it
up
in
plastic
until
I
put
it
in
glass
And
hang
up
in
the
hallway
so
I
can
always
look
at
it
And
as
for
all
me
and
D12
we
feel
like
"Fuck
rap!"
It
feels
like
our
general
just
fuckin'
died
in
our
lap
We
shut
off
all
our
pagers,
all
our
cell
numbers
is
changed
Our
two-ways
are
in
the
trash
So
some
cats
will
have
to
find
a
new
way
And
I
know
it
feels
like
the
dreams
will
die
with
you
today
But
the
truth
is
they're
all
still
here
and
you
ain't
Purple
Gang,
you
gotta
keep
pressin'
on
Don't
ever
give
up
the
dream,
dog,
I
got
love
for
you
all
And
Doody,
it's
true
you
brought
people
together
Who
never
woulda
been
in
the
same
room
if
it
wasn't
for
you
You
were
the
peacemaker,
Doody
I
know
sometimes
you
were
moody
But
you
hated
confrontation
and
truly
hated
the
feuding
But
you
was
down
for
yours
whenever
it
came
to
scrappin'
If
it
had
to
happen,
it
had
to
happen
Believe
me,
I
know
you're
the
one
who
taught
me
to
throw
them
'bows
back
on
Dresden
From
eggin'
cars
to
paintballin'
and
gettin'
arrested
To
sittin'
across
from
each
other
in
cells,
laughin'
and
jestin'
They
tried
to
hit
us
for
five
years
for
that,
no
question
I
guess
them
hookers
and
bums
that
we
shot
up
didn't
show
up
for
court,
so
we
got
off
on
a
technicality,
left
sweatin'
Me,
you
and…
what's
his
face?
I
forgot
his
fuckin'
name
Shame
he
even
came
to
your
funeral,
he
betrayed
our
team
And
if
I
see
him
again
I'ma
punch
him
in
the
fuckin'
face
And
that’s
on
Hailie
Jade,
Whitney
Laine
and
Alaina’s
name
I
let
the
pistol
bang
once
just
to
lick
a
shot
In
the
air
for
you
and
pour
some
liquor
out
With
Obie
in
the
parking
lot
of
54
just
before
We
were
supposed
to
get
in
cars
to
come
and
see
you
once
more
Difficult
as
it
sounds
Doody!
C'mon!
I
still
remember
the
Hip
Hop
Shop
days
All
I
ever
wanted
was
to
get
props,
not
praise
A
couple
eyebrows,
just
to
send
shock-shockwaves
Through
the
underground,
b-b-but
not
like
this
This
is
when
the
shit
g-g-g-got,
got
crazy
I
was
in
the
studio
with
the
Doc,
Doc
Dre-zy
That's
all
I
remember
'fore
the
shit
got,
got
hazy
Then
we
made
a
song
called
"M-m-my
Name
Is"
(Yeah)
And
it
skipped
right
over
hip-hop,
into
hip-hop
stations
Top
40
on
radio,
the
kid
got
famous
He
made
it,
but
this
was
j-j-just
not
the
way
this
Was
supposed
to
go,
I'm
afraid
to
say
this
but-
Thanks
it's
been
real
I
love
you
but
I
just
can't
deal
With
the
stress
this
game
is
giving
me...
But
before
I
go
You
know
I
can't
close
the
show
Without
no
closure
So
before
I
leave...
Yeah
I
just
want
to
take
the
time
out
to
basically
say
Rest
In
Peace
to
Deshaun
Holton
That's
my
heart
man
Dr.
Dre
For
giving
me
the
opportunity
Just
to
even
listen
to
me
To
get
me
to
this
point
I
wanna
thank
Jimmy
Iovine

The

game,
hip
hop
101
The
hardest
9-to-5
you'll
ever
have
You
can't
learn
this
shit
in
no
history
book
You
ready
to
rap,
motherfucker?
You
ready
to
sell
your
soul?
Ha-ha-ha-ha,
the
rap
game,
motherfucker!
I'm
a
disrupted
nigga,
you
made
me
crazy
You
should've
slayed
me
as
a
baby,
behavin'
shadier
Than
Wes
Craven
and
you
ain't
even
gotta
pay
me
I
take
pleasure
of
layin'
a
nigga
down
daily
You
face
me,
drunk
or
sober,
you’ll
faint
fast
I'm
never
fucked
up
to
where
I
can't
whoop
yo'
ass
Your
neck'll
get
snapped
with
bare
hands;
fuck
music
Is
he
rappin'?
It's
cool,
but
fools,
just
don't
confuse
it
What
happens:
these
dudes
get
rude,
then
I
lose
it
I'm
scandalous,
I'll
blow
your
two
kids
off
the
atlas
With
a
gat
that's
bigger
than
Godzilla's
back,
nigga
You
are
not
realer,
in
fact,
you'll
feel
the
effects
Of
a
crack
dealer,
y'all
presidents
sends
me
smack
And
got
a
MAC-10
with
it,
so
I
ain't
gotta
rap
But
I'm
thankful
for
that,
don't
mistaken
me,
black
Or
you'll
be
stankin'
in
the
back
of
a
fuckin'
Cadillac
I'ma
get
snuffed,
‘cause
I
ain't
said
enough
to
pipe
down
I'll
pipe
down
when
the
White
House
gets
wiped
out
When
I
see
that
little
Cheney
dyke
get
sniped
out
Lights
out,
bitch,
adiós,
goodnight
*gunshot*
(Ah!)
Now
put
that
in
your
little
pipe
and
bite
down
Think
for
a
minute,
‘cause
the
hype
just
died
down
That
I
won't
go
up
in
the
Oval
Office
right
now
And
flip
whatever
ain't
tied
down
upside
down
I'm
all
for
America;
fuck
the
government
Tell
that
C.
Delores
Tucker
slut
to
suck
a
dick
Motherfucker
ducked,
what
the
fuck?
Son
of
a
bitch
Take
away
my
gun,
I'm
gonna
tuck
some
other
shit
Can't
tell
me
shit
about
the
tricks
of
this
trade
Switchblade
with
a
little
switch
to
switch
blades
And
switch
from
a
six
to
a
sixteen-inch
blade
Shit's
like
a
samurai
sword;
a
sensei
Shit
just
don't
change
to
this
day
I'm
this
way,

ut-slay
itch-bay
Uck-say

(Yeah)
I
ain't
sellin'
my
soul
for
this
rap
game
And
I
ain't
diggin'
no
hole
for
this
rap
game
Man,
I'm
tellin'
you:

ain't
happenin'
This
rap
game,
this
rap
game
I
ain't
sellin'
my
soul
for
this
rap
game
I
ain't
diggin'
no
hole
for
this
rap
game
This
rap
game,
this
rap
game
I
bet
you'd
rather
me
drink
and
drown
in
my
own
inequity
But
fuck
that!
I'ma
rap
'til
y'all
all
get
sick
of
me
And
clutch
my
nut
sack
and
spit
all
who

at
me
A
pitt
and
rott
mix,

I'm
sayin'
you
motherfuckers
don't
know
us,

playin'
If
I'm
broke,
then
I'm
breakin'
up
in
the
place
where
you
layin'
You
know,
same
shit
every
nigga
done
in
his
life
I
look
at
this,
why
speak
on
what
I
want
when
I
write?
So
why
should
I
ever
fear
another
man
If
he
bleed
like
I
bleed,
take
a
piss
and
he
stand?
Okay,
you
win,
you
can
say
we
can't
rap
But
no
Source
never
made
me
not
buy
an
album
when
they
say
it
was
wack
I
walk
in
that
party
and
just
start
bustin'
Right
after
I
hear
the
last
verse
of
"Self
Destruction"
This
liquor
makes
me
wanna
blast
the
chrome
To
let
you
know
the
time
without
Morris
Day
and
Jerome
(Nigga)
I'm
low
down
and
shifty,

call

My
lifestyle
is
unstable:
a
partyin'
addict
They
said,
"No
fighting
in
the
club"
–
so
I
brought
me
a
'matic
Coughin'
the
static,
I
jump
niggas;
call
me
a
rabbit
Poppin'
the
tablet
and
guns
that
saw
you
in
half
with
Believe
me,

this
rap
shit,
fo'

Make
makin'
millions
look
easy
Everywhere
you
turn,
you
see

You

me,

me
Before
you
see
my
pistol
in

No
time
to
call
a
peace
treaty
Dial
911,
‘cause
you
need
the
Police
to
help
you
believe
me
I
snatch
the
chalk
from
the
sidewalk
and
piss
on
the
curb
This
is
absurd,
these
street
niggas
twistin'
my
words
We
finally
could
say
goodbye
to
Hollywood
'Cause
Proof
and
Shyne,
man,
shit,
nothing
in
common
The
nastiest
band
with
gats
in
each
hand
We
never
bow
down
to
be
a
flash
in
the
pan
No
remorse;
fuck
your
stature,
dog!
Nothing
to
do
with
hands
when
I
clap
at
y'all
Put
your
jaw
on
the
ground
with
the
four
and
the
pound
Then
I'm
gone
outta
town
'fore
the
law
come
around
So
we
can
battle
with
raps,
we
can
battle
with
gats
Matter
of
fact
we
can
battle
for

This

I'm

you're
gonna
see,
no
pistol
in
the
seat
Why
it
always
gotta
be
an
issue
when
you're
me?
And
which
you're
gonna
see
in
the
long
run,
I'ma
be
the
wrong
one
You
wanna
harass
with
this
limo-tinted
glass
Flashin'
that
flashlight
on
my
ass
—
where
was
you
at
Last
night
when
them
assholes
ran
up
on
my
grass?
Rapper
slash
actor,
kiss
the
crack
of
my
cracker
slash
ass
They
took
away
my
right
to
bear
arms
What
I'm
'posed
to
fight
with,
bare
palms?
Yeah,
right!
They
comin'
with
bombs
I'm
comin'
with
flare
guns;
we
as
Americans
We
as
Americans,
us
as
a
citizen
Gotta
protect
ourselves,
look
at
how
shit
has
been
We
better
check
ourselves,
livin'
up
in
these
streets
Through
worse
and
through
better
health,
survivin'
by
any
means
We
as
Americans,
us
as
a
citizen
We
are
Samaritans,
what
do
we
get
us
in?
We
better
check
ourselves,
look
at
how
shit
has
been
Take
a
look
where
you
live,
this
is
America
And
we
are
Americans
I
make
beaucoup
bucks,
wearin'
beaucoup
vests
Drama
hangin'
over
my
head,
like
a
voodoo
hex
I
coulda
been
next
to
fly
over
the
cuckoo's
nest
With
you-know-who,
with
an
S
tattooed
to
my
chest
But
I've
finessed
it,
now
I've
got
the
industry
pissy
Ever
since
me
and
Dre
split
it
fifty-fifty
on
50
It's
funny,
we
got
a
buzz
spreadin'
quicker
than
makin'
paper
Airplanes
out
of
a
twenty
—
Fuck
money!
I
don't
rap
for
dead
presidents,
I'd
rather
see
And
the
standards
and
they
can't
stand
it
My
name
shoulda
been
"Bastard",
the
shit
shoulda
been
plastered
On
my
forehead
with
a
stamp,
I
shoulda
been
blasted
I
shoulda
been
had
a
cap
put
in
my
ass
But
I'm
too
swift
and
fast
for
that,
I'm
past
it
I'm
too
old
to
go
and
cruise
Gratiot
—
fuck
that
shit!
I
done
seen
how
fast
this
rap
shit
Can
turn
into
some
pap-pap
shit,
that
quick,
snap
click
But
this
time,
they
got
the
fuckin'
automatic
Ain't
no
one
gon'
test
this
man

clack

We
as
Americans,
us
as
a
citizen
Gotta
protect
ourselves,
look
at
how
shit
has
been
We
better
check

We

We

what
do
we
get
us
in?
We
better
check
ourselves,
look
at
how
shit
has
been
Take
a
look
where
you
live,
this
is
America
And
we
are
Americans
(Shht!)
I
got
a
secret
if
you
can
keep
it
between
us
I
tuck
two
ninas
under
my
jeans,
either
side
of
my
penis
Under
my
long
johns,
under
my
Sean
Johns
One
run-in
with
the
long
arm
of
the
law,
I'm
long
gone
I'ma
do
five
years
—
no
less
than
that,
no
questions
asked
So
it
might
be
a
good
idea
that
I
stop
right
here
And
quit
while
I'm
ahead,
already
in
the
red
Already
got
a
steady
infrared
meant
for
my
head
A
target
on
my
back,
bigger
problems
than
that
Bin
Laden
on
my
ass,
he
probably
gon'
send
a
task
I
ain't
gon'
even
ask,
they
ain't
gon'
let
me
pack
They
ain't
gon'
give
me
my
semi,
but
I
got
my
weed
back
We

Americans,
us
as
a

Gotta

look

what

We
better
check

look
at
how
shit
has

Take
a
look
where
you
live,
this
is
America
And
we
are
Americans
Still
love
me?
Take
this
You
ready?
One,
two,
three!
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
makin'
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
'Cause
you
love
me,
and
I
love
you
more
It's
sick
but
who
could
ever
predict,
we'd
be
doin'
the
same
shit
We
say
we
do
it
for
our
baby
but
we
don't
We
do
it
for
us,
it's
lust
'cause
neither
one
Of
us
trust
each
other,
so
we
fuck
'til
we
bust
And
we
cuss
each
other
out,
we
know
what
it's
about,
shout
'Til
I
throw
you
out
the
house,
you
throw
me
out
the
house
I
throw
you
on
the
couch,
punch
you
in
the
mouth
Fist
fight
'til
we
turn
this
mother
out
Then
apologize
after,
laughter,
pain
It's
insane,
we're
back
in
the
same
chapter
again
And
it's
sad
but
it's
true,
when
I'm
layin'
here
with
you
There
ain't
nothin'
anyone
could
ever
say
or
ever
do
'cause
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
makin'
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
'Cause
you
love
me,
and
I
love
you
more
'Cause
I
hate
you,
do
you
hate
me?
Good,
'cause
you're
so
fuckin'
beautiful
when
you're
angry
It
makes
me
wanna
just
take
you
and
just
throw
you
On
the
bed
and
fuck
you
like
I
don't
even
know
you
You
fuck
other
people
and
I
fuck
other
people
You're
a
slut,
but
I'm
equal,
I'm
a
mutt,
we're
both
evil
In
our
ways
but
neither
one
of
us
would
ever
admit
it
'Cause
one
us
would
have
one
up
on
the
other
so
forget
it
We
can
make
accusations,
people
spread
rumors
But
they
ain't
got
proof,
'til
they
do
it's
just
the
two
of
us
It's
you
and
me,
'cause
any
chick
can
say
that
she
screwin'
me
But
you
gotta
believe
me
to
a
degree
'cause
true
indeed
If
you
didn't,
I
wouldn't
be
hittin'
—
yeah,
I
would
'Cause
the
sex
is
too
damn
good,
if
I
ran
who
would
I
run
to
That
would
be
this
soft
and
warm?
So
it's
off
and
on,
usually
more
off
than
on
But
at
least
we
know
that
we
share
this
common
bond
You're
the
only
one
I
can
fuck
without
a
condom
on
I
hope,
the
only
reason
that
I
cope
is
'cause
of
that
fact
And
plus
I
can
bust
in
that
and
that's
why
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
makin'
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
'Cause
you
love
me,
and
I
love
you
more
I
can
never
understand
it,
that's
why
I
don't
try
From
junior
high
until
we
both
die,
it's
silly
Oh,
why
must
we
try?
Is
it
really
so
rough
That
we
must
always
call
each
other's
Billy
Goat's
Gruff?
Try
to
pull
each
other's
legs,
until
the
other
begs
We're
lyin'
to
ourselves,
that's
the
beauty
of
it,
yeah!
'Cause
we
truly
love
each
other,
that's
why
we
always
fightin'
All
we
do
is
shove
each
other
every
other
fuckin'
night
And
it's
clear
it
ain't
gonna
change,
it's
pent-up
rage
We
both
had,
we
both
feel
like
we've
been
upstaged
By
someone
else,
we've
both
been
someone
else's
"Someone
else,"
problem
is
neither
one
wants
help
It's
an
addiction
and
it
can't
be
fixed
Our
family's
mixed
up,
there's
a
baby
sister
in
the
mix
And
it
hurts
'cause
the
pieces
to
the
puzzle
don't
fit
And
anybody
who
thinks
they
know
us
doesn't
know
shit
And
they're
probably
just
tired
of
hearin'
it
all
the
time
On
every
song,
every
lyric
and
every
rhyme
All
the
hoopla,
all
of
the
whoopty-woo
What
you
put
me
through,
fuckin'
whoopty-do
But
I
won't
be
made
a
fool
of
if
this
is
true
love
You
wouldn't
do
what
you
did
last
time,
you
wouldn't
screw
up
This
time,
'cause
this
time,
girl,
I'm
tellin'
you
what
You
do
it
again,
I'm
fuckin'
you
up
No
matter
what
you
say,
or
what
you
do
I'ma
hunt
you
down
'til
I
find
you
No
matter
where
you
run,
I'll
be
right
there
Right
behind
you,
in
your
nightmares
So
I
brought
you
the
flowers
and
the
candy
All
the
times
that
you
threw
it
back
at
me
Told
me
you
hate
me,
you
gon'
hate
me
more
When
you
find
out,
you
can't
escape
me,
whore
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
makin'
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
'Cause
you
love
me,
and
I
love
you
more
(I,
I
wanna
grow
up
too)
"Uncle
Marshall,
will
you
tell
us
a
bedtime
story?"
Here
we
go!
Now,
once
upon
a
time
not
long
ago
There
was
a
little
rapper
about
to
blow
But
his
album
came,
and
it
was
not
good
I
think
it
went
lead
or
double
copper-wood
So
these
silly
little
fans,
they
were
misled
By
a
nerdy
Internet
computer
hip-hop
head
"Me
and
you,
Clef,
we're
gonna
make
some
cash."
"Grab
this
silver
paint
and
just
paint
my
ass."
Hey,
mister,
would
you
care
to
bear
witness
to
The
ass-whippin'
I'm
about
to
administer
To
this
ass-kissin'
little
vaginal
blister?
Stanibus,
little
Marshall
Mathers'
sister
And
in
this
corner,
we
have
the
"Mr
Not-Havin'-It,"
it's
the
Mad,
sinister
Dr.
Evil,
with
his
bag
of
tricks
for
This
little
antagonistic
faggot
Dick-sucking
ex-LL
Cool
J
fan
from
Windsor
I'm
'bout
to
murder
little
Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You
bastard,
I
ain't
wanna
have
to
diss
ya
Canibus,
where
the
fuck
you
at?
I
miss
ya!
Canibitch,
oh,
Canibitch
Wherefore
art
thou,
Canibitch?
Please
tell
me
what
happened
with
That
style
that
you
were
rappin'
with
Canibitch,
oh,
Canibitch
Are
you
from
Los
Angeles
New
York,
or
just
a
janitor
From
Canada?
Oh,
Canibitch
Now,
at
first,
I
ain't
really
understand
this
shit
Picture
me,
for
a
second,
and
imagine
it
Chillin'
in
the
Bat
Mansion
relaxin'
when
All
of
a
sudden
some
bullshit
comes
across
the
scanners,
it's
Canibitch,
on
some
'Stan
Lives'
shit
It
creeped
me
out
at
first;
man,
this
is
sick
But
me,
bein'
just
as
sick,
this
conflict
Gets
my
dick
harder
than
arithmetic
And
I
know
how
you
jealous
ones
envy
I
shoulda
knew
better
from
the
first
few
letters
you
sent
me
The
first
two
letters,
you
were
tellin'
me
shit
like
You
respect
me,
like
any
other
regular
MC
The
third
letter,
you
asked
how
come
I
ain't
return
None
of
the
messages
at
Shady
Records
you
left
me
The
fourth
letter:
"Slim,
you're
really
startin'
to
upset
me."
The
fifth
letter
told
me
you
were
comin'
to
get
me
The
sixth
letter,
there's
a
bomb
threat
on
our
building
This
crazy
motherfucker's
really
tryna
kill
me
So
I
went
back
and
read
the
first
few
letters
that
said
Some
shit
about
a
message
you
left
Oh
shit!
That's
not
a
E,
that's
an
A!
This
dude
wants
to
leave
me
a
'massage,'
he's
gay!
Right
away,
I'm
on
the
phone
with
Dr.
Dre
"We
got
a
bogey,"
"Marshall,
I'm
on
the
way."
Canibitch,
oh,
Canibitch
Wherefore
art
thou,
Canibitch?
Please
tell
me
what
happened
with
That
style
that
you
were
rappin'
with
Canibitch,
oh,
Canibitch
Are
you
from
Los
Angeles
New
York,
or
just
a
janitor
From
Canada?
Oh,
Canibitch
So,
in
two
seconds
flat,
Dre's
at
my
crib
Only
thing
is,
we
both
know
where
this
kid
lives
And
neither
one
of
us
have
Canadian
citizenship
"Shit.
Oh,
Dre,
wait
a
minute,
that's
it!
All
we
gotta
do
is
use
a
bit
of
turbo-boost
So
we're
off
to
Toronto
and
we're
gainin'
speed
"What
was
that?
Oh,
Jermaine
Dupri."
"Fuck
it,"
keep
goin',
no
time
to
waste
"Wait,
back
up.
Hit
him
one
more
time,
in
case."
"Okay,"
fuck,
now
he's
draggin'
under
the
car
"Oh
well,
only
thirty
more
thousand
miles!"
Meanwhile,
me
and
Dre
are
tryna
conversate
Just
tryna
find
a
reason
for
the
constant
hate
And
tryna
figure
out
what
happened
to
'Germaine
Propane'
"He
couldn't
have
fell
off
that
hard."
Ain't
no
way!
What
happened
to
the
way
you
was
rappin'
When
you
was
scandalous?
That
Canibus
turned
into
a
television
evangelist!
Plus,
he
raps
with
his
regular
voice
So,
we
pull
up
to
the
bridge
where
he
last
was
spotted
His
corpse
was
still
movin',
but
his
ass
was
rotted
And
he
kinda
smelled
a
little
like
Courtney
Love
I
figured
if
I
stick
him
with
a
fork,
he's
done
So
I
stabbed
him
twice,
kept
jabbin'—Christ!
He
won't
die!
This
guy's
like
a
battered
wife!
He's
like
Kim:
he
keeps
comin'
back
for
more
But
he
won't
fight
back,
I
cracked
his
jaw
Hold
up!
'Bis,
quit
foldin'
up!
Punch
me
in
the
chest,
make
my
shoulders
touch
Do
something!
At
least
one
punchline!
Come
on!
'Til
the
meter
reads
Nine!
Nine!
Nine-
Ty
nine
percent
of
my
fans
are
blond!
'Bis,
come
on,
answer
me,
man,
respond!
Tell
me
'bout
the
sun,
rain,
moon
and
stars!
Intergalactical
metaphors
from
Mars!
Raw
to
the
floor,
raw
like
Reservoir
Dogs!
Bite
another
line
from
Redman's
song!
Suddenly,
the
stub
of
a
dead
man's
arm
From
a
midget
reaches
out
from
under
the
car
It's
J.D.!
This
motherfucker
won't
die,
neither!
Dre
starts
sprayin'
him
with
cans
of
ether
We
swamped
the
bitch
in
it;
stomped
the
bitch
again
"Compton!"
"Detroit,
bitch,
talk
some
shit
again!"
"Stomp
him!"
"Switch
feet!"
"Stomp
him!"
"Switch
again!"
"Dre,
all
right,
he's
dead,
dog,
quit
kickin'
him!
I
think
Stanibus
jumped
off
the
bridge
again!"
("Ahh!")
"Damn,"
"He
disappeared,
yo,
he's
gone,
he
did
it
again!"
Canibitch,
oh,
Canibitch
Wherefore
art
thou,
Canibitch?
Please
tell
me
what
happened
with
That
style
that
you
were
rappin'
with
Canibitch,
oh,
Canibitch
Are
you
from
Los
Angeles
New
York,
or
just
a
janitor
From
Canada?
Oh,
Canibitch
Yo,
check
it
out
What's
fucked
up
Is
I
don't
see
either
one
of
us
budging
"I'm
withholding
my
anger
Though
I'd
like
to
be
the
strangler
Of
this
punk
ass
little
pussy's
puny
neck
It's
my
right
to
insist
That
he
acknowledge
my
existence
But
he
just
displays
complete
lack
of
respect"
That's
what
he
says
to
himself
As
he
use
his
magazines
to
trash
me
As
he
sits
with
both
his
feet
up
at
his
desk
Smokes
a
bag
of
his
weed
And
starts
imagining
things
And
he
just
can't
see
that
he's
manically
depressed
And
in
his
jealousy
and
envy
It
just
whirls
him
in
a
frenzy
As
he
turns
on
MTV
and
sees
my
face
He
don't
exist
in
this
world
So
he
just
twists
and
he
twirls
Spirals
and
spins
'til
he
hurls
himself
into
a
rage
And
it's
destroying
him
slowly
'Cause
he
does
not
even
know
me
Even
though
he
sees
me
everywhere
he
goes
So
he
just
tortures
himself,
he
has
no
fortune
and
wealth
So
he
extorts
someone
else
to
get
his
dough
And
now
he's
acting
like
a
bully
so
he
tries
to
push
and
pull
me
But
he
knows
that
he
can't
fool
me
so
he's
mad
And
he
has
no
choice
but
to
scream
and
raise
his
voice
up
at
me
'Cause
it
annoys
him
to
see
that
I
ain't
scared
You
ain't
no
motherfucking
(bully)
And
I
ain't
bowing
to
no
motherfucking
(bully)
I
won't
allow
it,
ain't
gon'
cower
to
no
(bully)
I'll
be
damned
if
I
don't
stand
up
to
a
(bully)
Fight
like
a
man
and
throw
my
hands
up
to
a
(bully...)
And
I
know
it
must
be
fucking
with
you
emotionall(y...)
Now
I'm
not
trying
to
make
no
more
enemies,
no
more
unfortunately
There's
so
many
other
motherfuckers
there
just
are
They
just
keep
hounding
at
me
Now
that
I'm
down
with
50
Suddenly
now
I
got
beef
with
this
faggot
Ja
But
his
ass
is
such
a
puppet,
Irv
could
shove
his
whole
hand
up
it
And
just
make
him
say
what
he
wants
him
to
say
But
Suge
has
Irv's
on
a
string
and
Irv's
so
nervous
that
he
Says
anything
to
this
man
to
keep
him
at
bay
So
now
Ja
thinks
that
he's
so
tough
and
Murder
Inc.'s
the
big
bad
wolf
And
they
go
huff
and
puff
and
blow
our
label
down
But
our
building's
made
out
of
bricks
so
you
ain't
taking
out
shit
And
dawg
you
just
did
a
song
with
Bobby
Brown
So
now
you
try
to
pull
the
race
card
and
it
backfires
in
your
face
hard
'Cause
you
know
we
don't
play
that
black
and
white
shit
Plus
this
stylist
that
you
fucked
when
you
was
ecstasied
up
Was
just
a
man
who's
dressed
up
as
a
white
bitch
You
ain't
no
motherfucking
(bully)
And
I
ain't
bowing
to
no
motherfucking
(bully)
I
won't
allow
it,
ain't
gon'
cower
to
no
(bully)
I'll
be
damned
if
I
don't
stand
up
to
a
(bully)
Fight
like
a
man
and
throw
my
hands
up
to
a
(bully...)
You
must
be
taking
too
much
(E...)
Now
what
bothers
me
the
most
about
hip-hop
is
we
so
close
To
picking
up
where
we
left
off
with
Big
and
Pac
We
just
lost
Jam
Master
J,
Big
L
got
blasted
away
Plus
we
lost
Bugz,
Slang
Ton,
and
Freaky
Tah
It's
like
a
never-ending
cycle
that
just
seems
to
come
full
circle
Everybody's
gotta
be
so
fucking
hard
And
I'm
not
excluding
myself
'cause
I
been
stupid
as
well
I
been
known
to
lose
it
when
someone
says
something
smart
But
as
we
grow
as
men,
we
learn
to
let
shit
go,
but
then
again
There's
only
so
much
bullshit
we
can
really
stand
We
all
got
reps
to
uphold
when
someone
steps
on
our
toes
It's
no
exception,
it
goes
for
every
man
But
if
Irv
really
gave
a
fuck
about
Ja
like
he
claims
he
does
He'd
wake
him
up
and
make
his
boy
get
off
them
drugs
But
he
just
keeps
feeding
him
pills
so
if
that
E
doesn't
kill
him
Someone
from
G-Unit
will
and
I
ain't
buzzed
Dawg,
I'm
talking
to
you
straight
if
the
situation
escalates
Any
worse,
we're
gon'
lose
another
soldier
to
this
game
And
if
I
get
killed
for
this
rap
I
got
a
million
in
cash
That
says
I
will
get
you
back
in
Hailie's
name
You
ain't
no
motherfucking
(bully)
And
I
ain't
bowing
to
no
motherfucking
(bully)
I
won't
allow
it,
ain't
gon'
cower
to
no
(bully)
I'll
be
damned
if
I
don't
stand
up
to
a
(bully)
Fight
like
a
man
and
throw
my
hands
up
to
a
(bully...)
Irvine,
get
your
boy
off
that
(E...)
Get
at
me,
dog
Holla
Hailie,
what
do
you
want
to
be
when
you
grow
up,
baby?
I
don't
know,
but
I
don't
want
to
Grow
up
to
be

And

pencil
Look

into
I
see
you

your
niche,
you

a

Claiming
you
a

and
you

You

D,
‘cause

You

Pac's
dick,

replica

If
he

All

do
is
cry,
bitch,
keep

real
Life

imitating
niggas
and
eating
pills
And
what
kind
of
motherfucker
ruins
three
deals
That
another
nigga

They
didn't
see

And
I

And
Ja

And

It's

Doe,

So
Murder

You
unleashed
on
a
team
Who
expects
nothin'
less
than
R&B
coming
from

regime
"Regime"

extreme
Neck

Weave

Now

To

A

With

Go

And
pull

Slim

He

the
gangstas
What
up,
Gotti?
And
this
little
war
you
pushed
on
Put
your
ear
to
the
ground
for
stepping
on
bush
stones
What's
wrong?
Didn't
think
we
strong
with
real
niggas?
Roll
like
a
boss,
in
the
streets
they
still
feel
us
It's
real
business,
y'all
ain't
caught
the
concept
You
talking
nonsense
to
walking
bomb
threats
Contact
was
blown
by
Benzetta
in
The
Source
Threaten
at
the
boss,
you
gon'
see
me
on
your
porch
Now
Irv
got
the
nerve
to
try
to
serve

But

Word

nigga
Bugz,
punks

Stomped
unconscious
and

the
heater
This

monster
gets
jabbed
in
the
tonsils
With
dicks
so
much
that
he
should
be
fixed

a
vagina
Who's

ya?
Cadillac
Pac
or
that
transvestite?
That
dress

Lil
Kim

Press

Swallow

You

This
ain't
beef
man
I
don't

what
the
fuck
to
call
it
But
no
beef
What

X?
Just
hit
'em
I
float
like
Big's
spirit
in
this
bitch,
I'm
ghostly
Rush
me,
'cause
you
ain't
gonna
live
to
roast
me
I'll
have
my
motherfucking
ass
kicked
by
Moby
If
I
let
some
bitch
in
the
can
like
'Bis
cop
over
me
To
do
war
and
try
to
bring
my
crew
back
down
I'll
never
stoop
to
that
level
to
do
that
now
I
got
a
new
cat,
this
time
I'm
pulling
two
gats
out
With
bullets
(*bang*)
I
finally
got
something
to
shoot
at
now
Let's
see
who
got
they
city
on
lock
Let's
see
who
got
the
better
aim
with
the
Glock
Let's
see
who
come
out
on
top
Let's
see
who
really
want
their
name
in
the
streets
Let's
see
who
wanna
die
the
same
time
as
me
and
make
ends
meet
Now
was
I
blessed
with
a
gift
or
cursed
with
a
curse?
I
follow
(Ugh!)
hearse
after
hearse
with
verse
after
verse
And
I'll
be
damned
if
I
let
Billy
"Dance"
Dupri
Or
anybody
swing
an
axe
at
my
family
tree
So
now!
I
love
it
when
you
niggas
be
talking,
saying
my
name
Seems
like
your
mouth
is
not
connected
to
your
brain
Two-zero-zero-three,
and
shit,
it
ain't
the
same
Better
have
a
strap,
my
nigga,
simple
and
plain
Put
your
nuts
on
the
table,
my
nigga,
let's
play
the
game
Hurt
you
so
long,
you'll
be
a-ddicted
to
pain
I
don't
wanna
hear
what
you
meant,
do
not
explain
Right
before
you
lay
in
your
coffin,
ho,
say
my
name
Why
do
you
hate
me?
I
came
from
nothing
Blood,
sweat,
and
tears,
you
did
not
create
me
How
can
you
doubt
me?
You
don't
know
shit
about
me
There'd
be
no
West
Coast
without
me
Cut
with
the
bullshit,
I
struggle
for
survival
And
now
you
tryna
act
like
my
rival?
Watch
what
you
say,
partner,
it's
a
small
earth
Don't
play
games
with
your
life,
nigga,
it's
not
worth...
All
the
pain
(All
the
pain),
all
the
agony
(All
the
agony)
All
the
horror
(All
the
horror),
all
the
tragedy
(All
the
tragedy)
Put
your
hands
up
people,
it's
time
to
fight
now!
I
beat
holes
in
your
chest,
remain
hostile
Threaten
my
life?
(C'mon!)
One
day,
you'll
understand
They
say
that
pride
is
the
sign
of
a
foolish
man
So
who
the
FUCK!
you
think
you
talking
to?
Live
and
direct
in
the
flesh,
I'm
right
in
front
of
you!
I
love
it
when
you
niggas
be
talking,
saying
my
name
Seems
like
your
mouth
is
not
connected
to
your
brain
Two-zero-zero-three,
and
shit,
it
ain't
the
same
Better
have
a
strap,
my
nigga,
simple
and
plain
Put
your
nuts
on
the
table,
my
nigga
let's
play
the
game
Hurt
you
so
long,
you'll
be
a-ddicted
to
pain
I
don't
wanna
hear
what
you
meant,
do
not
explain
Right
before
you
lay
in
your
coffin,
ho,
say
my
name
I
never
really
smashed
on
Jermaine's
ass,
Dre
smashed
him
Nobody
ganged
up
'til
he
came
back
and
jacked
him
I
never
really
brought
it
to
his
ass,
I
tapped
him
I
could
have
been
like
Treach,
poom-papped
and
slapped
him
Purple,
for
mimicking
him
with
two
rapping
Urkels
I
could
have
snapped,
took
it
past
rap
and
hurt
you
But
I
didn't,
I
kept
it
on
wax
and
served
you
I
square
dance
'cause
I'm
sick
of
rapping
circles
Around
these
clowns,
steady
trying
to
call
me
out
It's
like
I'm
listening
to
motherfucking
dogs
meow
You'd
probably
do
better
trying
to
come
and
stomp
me
out
You
don't
want
it
with
rap,
this
is
what
I'm
all
about
(C'mon!)
(I'm)
No
gangsta,
you
ain't
either
(Will)
But
I
know
that
I
spit
ether
(Not)
I
should've
crossed
your
belly
(Lose)
Show
you
I'm
not
R.
Kelly
(X!)
Pass
me
the
weed
I'ma
put
my
ashes
out
on
his
ass
for
the
last
time,
man:
Watch
your
fucking
mouth
I
love
it
when
you
niggas
be
talking,
saying
my
name
Seems
like
your
mouth
is
not
connected
to
your
brain
Two-zero-zero-three,
and
shit,
it
ain't
the
same
Better
have
a
strap,
my
nigga,
simple
and
plain
Put
your
nuts
on
the
table,
my
nigga,
let's
play
the
game
Hurt
you
so

I

Right

in
your

It's
the
last
time,
man
I'm
through
Psst,
hey,
listen
La
la
la
la
la
la
la
la
la
laaaa
I
love
my

Makes
me

Can
you
fly?
I
can,
wanna
see?
I'm
only
entertainin'
you,
my
Goal
is
to
stimulate,
makin'
you
high
And
take
you
and
I
To
a
place
you
can't
see,
but
I
believe
you
can
fly
I
don't
mean
nobody
harm,
I'm
just
partyin'
I'm
not
your
dad,
not
your
mom,
not
your
guardian
Just
a
man
who's
on
the
mic
So
let
me
entertain
you
My
lyrical
content
is
constantly
under
fire
No
wonder
why
I
constantly
bomb
back
To
combat
attacks
with
constant
concepts
When
lyrics
are
constantly
took
outta
context
Failure
to
communicate
with
Congress
has
Been
a
problem
for
the
longest,
I
guess
But
maybe
one
day
we
can
make
some
progress
Food
for
thought,
see
how
long
it
takes
to
digest
Feelin'
good
when
I
should
be
ashamed
Shit,
I
really
shoulda
fell
but
I
stood,
see,
I
came
Like
a
flame
in
the
night
Like
a
ghost
in
the
dark
There's
a
ray,
there's
a
light
There's
a
hope,
there's
a
spark
But
when
planets
collide
they'll
never
see
eye
to
eye
Until
they
decide
to
set
the
differences
aside
And
this
is
why
only
one
of
us
will
survive
So
children,
follow
my
lead
and
feel
the
vibe,
because—
I'm
only
entertainin'
you,
my
Goal
is
to
stimulate,
makin'
you
high
And
take
you
and
I
To
a
place
you
can't
see,
but
I
believe
you
can
fly
I
don't
mean
nobody
harm,
I'm
just
partyin'
I'm
not
your
dad,
not
your
mom,
not
your
guardian
Just
a
man
who's
on
the
mic
So
let
me
entertain
you
My
music
can
be
slightly
amusin'
You
shouldn't
take
lyrics
so
serious,
it
might
be
confusin'
Just
tryin'
to
separate
the
truth
from
entertainment
It's
stupid,
ain't
it?
I
get
sick
of
tryin'
to
explain
it
See,
I
could
sit
and
argue
with
you,
but
it
goes
beyond
Just
being
a
snot,
pointy-nosed
bleach-blond
'Cause
I
came
here
to
uplift,
let
your
woes
be
gone
Tell
'em
to
get
fucked
and
just
mosey
on
Constantly
movin',
constantly
usin'
The
Constitution
as
a
form
of
restitution
Bless
the
children,
nothin'
less
than
brilliant
Let
me
entertain
you
like
Robbie
Williams
I'll
be
here
when
y'all
are
gone,
rebuildin'
World
revolvin',
still
evolvin',
still
Slim
How
many
kids
will
copy?
Prob'ly
millions
But
I'ma
do
this
as
a
fuckin'
hobby
till
then,
'cause—
I'm
only
entertainin'
you,
my
Goal
is
to
stimulate,
makin'
you
high
And
take
you
and
I
To
a
place
you
can't
see,
but
I
believe
you
can
fly
I
don't
mean
nobody
harm,
I'm
just
partyin'
I'm
not
your
dad,
not
your
mom,
not
your
guardian
Just
a
man
who's
on
the
mic
So
let
me
entertain
you
My
lyrical
content
contains
subject
matter
That
sucks
up
all
these
fucked
up
young
kids
At
an
alarming
rate;
common
denominate
Add
it
up
and
you'll
see
just
why
I
dominate
I
try
to
stimulate,
but
kids
emulate
And
mimic
every
move
you
make,
"Slim,
you
great!"
But
wait,
can't
you
see
I'm
only
here
to
entertain?
I
gotta
be
the
one
to
go
against
the
grain
'Cause
man,
I
see
it,
feel
it,
live
it,
but
it's
inhumane
For
me
to
see
you
be
influenced
and
pretend
you
ain't
But
they
don't
understand
that
I've
been
through
pain
If
you
get
to
know
me
I
could
be
a
friend
you
gain
But
you
can't
just
stand
there
and
try
to
judge
It
hurts
but
your
jealousy
probably
tears
you
up
inside
as
much
And
it's
such
a
pleasure,
every
button
that
I
touch
I
treasure
every
glutton
that
I
punish
in
my
lust,
but—
I'm
only
entertainin'
you,
my
Goal
is
to
stimulate,
makin'
you
high
And
take
you
and
I
To
a
place
you
can't
see,
but
I
believe
you
can
fly
I
don't
mean
nobody
harm,
I'm
just
partyin'
I'm
not
your
dad,
not
your
mom,
not
your
guardian
Just
a
man
who's
on
the
mic
So
let
me
entertain
you
{Backmasked}
I'm
not
here
to
save
you
I'm
only
here
for
the
ride
So
let
me
entertain
you
And
everything
will
be
fine
Woo-hoo!
*laughs*
Guess
who's
back?!
Mommy,

Say

Everywhere

Forty,

Samoans,
they
knowin'
when
D-Bo
was
50,
Tweezy,
Obie,
there
won't
be
no
ho
in
us
They
pop
shit
like
they
gonna
do
shit
but
no
one
does
From
New
York
down
to
Texas,
back
up
to
Los
Angeles
We
changed
the
way
we
move,
so
man
up
if
you
can't
adjust
You
may
end
up
getting
rushed
by
too
many
to
handle
us
(Ha)
It's
funny,
I
guess
money
does
have
its
advantages
And
it
isn't
that
we
just
think
that
we
can't
be
touched
It's
not
like
we're
just
feeling
ourselves
that
much,
it's
just
That
if
someone
ever
does
put
us
in
the
clutch
We
just
know
that
y'all
ain't
gon'
be
the
one
who's
gon'
do
it
'Cause
first
of
all
you're
pussy
and
everybody
can
see
that
You
fuck
around,
get
caught
in
a
spot
that
you
shouldn't
be
at
That
you
got
no
business
being
in,
we
ain't
even
gon'
be
in
it
No
one's
gonna
hear
nothing,
no
one's
gonna
see
this
shit
And
they'll
be
in
and
up
out
of
it,
them
boys
is
'bout
it,
'bout
it
The
noise
from
clips
and
rounds
be
drowned
out
by
the
crowd
And
you'll
be
laying
on
the
ground
getting
trampled
by
people
dancing
'Til
the
club
closes,
and
clears
out,
and
that's
when
they
see
you
flattened
Nobody
saw
it
happen,
all
'cause
your
jaws
are
flapping
And
you
couldn't
stop
yapping
and
took
it
past
rapping
It
ain't
about
the
music
no
more,
it's
'bout
trying
to
show
off
And
it
feels
like
any
minute
the
bomb
is
about
to
go
off
Shit's
about
to
change,
'cause
we
ain't
playin'
no
games
We
ain't
budgin',
neither
are
they,
we
ain't
sayin'
no
names
Shit
just
ain't
the
same
when
AK's
get
to
sprayin'
"Hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
9-1-1"
It
ain't
about
hip-hop,
'cause
those
days
are
gone
It
ain't
about
tryna
rip
shots
to
get
props
no
more
It's
about
trying
not
to
get
popped,
and
get
dropped
to
the
floor
'Cause
"Hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
9-1-1"
Took
my
strap
off
my
holster,
'cause
shit
is
getting
serious
All
theses
drugs
you
be
fucking
with
make
you
delirious
Thinking
you
coming
with
heat,
yo
son,
I'm
curious
How
long
are
you
gonna
hate
us
and
judge
us
and
jury
us?
Some
people
can
never
fade
us,
that
make
us
so
furious
Mistake
us
for
fakers,
homie
we
greater
and
glorious
We
living
for
real
and
others
just
making
the
stories
up
Illusions
are
broken,
so
live
it
up,
you
corny
fucks
If
you
take
a
fucking
minute
to
think
about
what
you
done
When
you
stood
against
the
gangster
who
live
and
die
by
the
gun
Caught
a
hot
one,
sprayin'
you
bitches
'til
there
was
none
I'm
like
a
rolling
stone
homie,
I
got
you
under
my
thumb
You
silly
little
bitches
can
end
up
right
up
in
ditches
We
cut
you
and
give
you
stitches
for
envyin'
all
our
riches
The
game's
just
like
a
midget,
you
clockin'
a
small
digit
Dealing
with
the
Giant
Goliath,
people
that's
how
we
live
it,
c'mon
Shit's
about
to
change,
'cause
we
ain't
playin'
no
games
We
ain't
budgin',
neither
are
they,
we
ain't

Uh,
Ganxsta,
Ganxsta
who
come
to
pay
you
a
visit
On
the
shit
you
call
hip-hop,
this
function
is
where
did
it
When
I
put
it
in
motion,
my
focus
is
getting
branded
My
appetite
for
destruction
is
blasted
because
I
said
it
Got
you
stumbling
for
cover,
this
music
dying
in
numbers
But
you
wouldn't
pause
and
wonder,
admitting
it's
all
glamour
When
you
enter
the
business
you
thinking
you
running
shit
You
witness
that
funny
shit,
your
bitches
they
ain't
shit!
We
gangstas
we
blast
first,
ask
questions
later
All
these
imitators
parading
like
they
some
players
Tryna
save
hip-hop
the
task
is
something
greater
'Cause
we
old
fashioned
coded
with
loyalty
motivators
Get
caught,
I'm
not
telling,
or
more
like
killing
not
caring
I'm
riding
a
gangsta
feeling,
no
fearing
when
gangstas
dying
I'm
in
a
full
circle
with
homies
that's
s'posed
to
bleed
On
an
8
Mile
mission
with
Cypress
and
O.G.'s
Shit's
about
to
change,
'cause
we
ain't
playin'
no
games
We
ain't
budgin',
neither
are
they,
we
ain't

It's…
(It's…)
be…
(be…)
…cause
(…cause)
of…
(of…)
These
drugs
I
do;
that's
why
I
do
the
things
I
do
It's
because
of
these
drugs
that
I
do
that
make
me
Do
these
things
that
I
do,
do
these
things
that
I
do
Be…
cause…
of…
These
drugs
I
do;
that's
why
I
do
the
things
I
do
It
was
like,
"Whoa…"
And
then
the
fucking
room
started
spinnin'
and
shit
And
my
friend
came
in;
he
was
like,
"Yo,
yo!
Em,
Em!
You
puttin'
that
shit
up
your
nose
again?”
And
I
was
like,
"Nah",
nuttin',
like,
everything
was
just
spinnin'
I
couldn't
even
see,
and
like,
he
started
to
look
like
a
monster
and
shit
Then
I
just
started
laughin'
and
threw
up
all
over
the
fuckin'
floor
It's
crazy
My
music
is
therapeutic
for
whoever's
there
to
use
it
It's
like,
Lucifer's
here
to
influence
listeners
through
it
You
probably
do
what
it
said
to
do
just
from
listenin'
to
it
It's
got
the
power
to
get
you
to
do
it
(Come
on!)
So
when
the
shit
comes
on,
I
wanna
see
some
shit
jump
off
Some
bitch
get
slapped,
some
motherfucking
kid
get
stomped
(Aaahhh!)
So
get
this
song,
go
run
out
and
buy
this
disc
And
try
this
shit,
as
much
coke
as
I
just
did
'Cause
times
like
these,
got
me
doin'
lines
like
these
Plus,
I
grab
a
pencil
every
time
that
I
light
weed
It's
probably
because
of
the
drugs;
Shady
does
what
he
does
And
is
what
it
is;
I'm
dizzy,
Bizzy,
visit
these
kids
Hey,
Stephanie
(Hi!)
Let's
take
some
ecstasy
(Okay!)
Now
pull
your
pants
down,
bitch,
and
have
sex
with
this
dog
next
to
me
(Huh?)
‘Til
I'm
dead
I'm
takin'
blunts
to
the
head
Needles
in
my
broken
leg,
listen
to
Grateful
Dead
These
mescalines
got
me
sure
That
I
can
fuck
any
whore
with
genital
warts
on
the
Warped
Tour
Who
slipped
this
downer
in
my
Snapple?
Cussin'
out
Interscope
(Bizarre,
you're
signed
to
Capitol!)
Fuck
it,
I
was
born
with
half
a
brain
Sniffin'
'caine,
at
celebrity
basketball
games
You
motherfuckers
think
I'm
a
gimmick
'Cause
I
got
a
Cash
Money
tattoo
and
roll
with
No
Limit
(Uuuuhhhh!)
The
last
time
I
sniffed
blow
I
ended
up
in
Denver,
Colorado
at
an
Iggy
Pop
show
Bizarre
be
smokin'
a
half
a

Fuckin'
the
engineer's
wife,
while
he's
mixin'
my
song
down
It's…
(It's…)
be…
(be…)
…cause
(…cause)
of…
(of…)
These
drugs
I
do;
that's
why
I
do
the
things
I
do
It's
because
of
these
drugs
that
I
do
that
make
me
Do
these
things
that
I
do,
do
these
things
that
I
do
Be…
cause…
of…
These
drugs
I
do;
that's
why
I
do
the
things
I
do
It's
like,
back
when
I
first
went
on
tour
I
like,
went
crazy;
I
was
like,
out
of
control
And…
just
was
fuckin'
wasted
every
night,
like
Wakin'
up
the
next
morning
like,
"Where
the—"
"Where
the
fuck
am
I
at?
What
the
fuck
is
goin'
on?"
You
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
I
was
just
like,
out
of
control
These
Benadryls
got
me
stiffer
than
a
mannequin
Eight
years
old
swallowin'
Anacins,
standin'
over
my
bannister
Laughin'
with
a
chromed
out
caliber
(Ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha…)
The
weed
that
I'm
sellin'
is
black,
look
like
the
back
of
a
tarantula
I
keep
a
substantial
amount
of
aspirins
in
my
Acura
Smashin'
it,
after
framin'
a
nigga
with
smack
and
dust
I'm
scandalous;
drugs
been
ran
for
months
Crackin'
capsules
to
expand
our
blunts
I
rolled
it
up
and
take
the
pressure
to
the
head
Now
I'm
lookin'
like
a
extra
on
"Night
of
the
Living
Dead"
Until
they
find
me
on
a
stretcher
I'm
quick
to
sample
anything;
bitch,
you
got
a
tester?
This
crank'll
have
me
blowin'
up
banks
like
Uncle
Fester
Aaaahhhh…
Watch
tonight,
you'll
admit
that
I'm
a
fiend
Pop

Missin'

It's…

These

I
do;
that's
why
I

I

It's

I

These
drugs
I
do;
that's
why
I
do
the
things
I
do
'Cause
I
like,
I
always
tell
people,
you
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
Like,
if
you
got
an
addiction,
don't
admit
it,
to
nobody,
you
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
Keep
that
shit
to
yourself,
because
if
anybody
sees
that,
you
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
When
you're
out
in
the
public
eye
and
shit,
they're
always
gonna
think
that
you're
on
that
shit,
even
if
you're
not
That's
why
I
always
tell
my
friends,
you
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
But,
I
mean,
like,
for
me,
I
don't
give
a
fuck;
I'll
probably
end
up
dyin'
from
this
shit
one
day
Probably
pick
up
a
newspaper
in
the
morning
and
it's
like,
"Eminem
dies
from
drug
overdose"
You
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
And—
And
my
friends,
they
ain't
no
fuckin'
better,
you
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
They
ain't
nothin'
but
influences,
bad
influences
to
me,
so
It's
peer
pressure,
shit
is
like
all
peer
pressure
That's
what
it
boils
down
to,
and…
I
give

Tweedle-dee,

Doesn't
take
much
for
me
to
raise
such
a
stink
up
When
motherfuckers
hate
your
guts
You
ain't
even
gotta
say
much
For
me
to
put
a
pen
to
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
Is
like
smearing
a
bloodstain
with
a
paint
brush
I
can’t
explain
what
it
is
my
brain
does
But
however
it
works,
it's
insane,
it's
plain
nuts
And
it
ain't
just
my
brain
that’s
dangerous
It’s
a
whole
combination
of
things,
it
takes
nuts
And
I’m
not
afraid
to
raise
the
stakes
up
I
got
a
million
bucks
in
the
bank
and
eight
trucks
For
anybody
who
gets
on
the
track
and
spanks
us
I'm
patiently
waiting
for
the
day,
I’m
anxious
To
see
the
look
on
ya
fake
mugs
when
you
thugs
go
bankrupt
Ya
drunk,
you
ain't
tough
Whatever
you
drank
must've
just
turned
you
into
some
gangstas
This
is
me
talking,
motherfucker,
this
ain’t
drugs
You
wanna
pop
shit?
Wake
up
then
make
up
Fuck
that!
It’s
too
late
chump,
now
face
up
I
pray
for
the
day
that
someone
who
spits
with
the
caliber
that
Nas
and
Jay
does
Opens
up
his
jaw
to
say
somethin'
or
rattle
my
name
off
Or
rattle
the
first
thing
from
the
top
of
his
brain
off
So
I
can
blow
the
fucking
dust
off
of
this
chainsaw
And
give
him
the
surgery
that
he
came
for
'Til
I
pull
the
paint
off,
I
never
been
shot
But
I
think
me
and
Fifty
must've
been
cut
from
the
same
cloth
'Cause
I've
always
came
off
like
Ja's
chain
when
they
try
to
rush
him
And
lost
and
came
back
and
gave
him
a
watch
in
exchange
for
it
I
don’t
stop,
only
thing
that
I
wait
for
Is
the
day
that
I
ain't
gotta
report
to
probate
court
'Cause
I'ma
give
you
all
a
reason
to
hate
more
'Cause
I
been
holding
my
tongue
'til
I
got
a
sprained
jaw
A
lot
of
rappers
on
my
list
that
just
ain’t
Ja
And
I'ma
read
that
motherfucker
off
come
April
You
pussies
think
I
went
soft
'cause
8
Mile
When
I
come
back
I’ll
be
shooting
more
than
just
paintballs
Trust
me
Monkey
see,
monkey
do
Don't
ever
make
the
first
move,
just
let
'em
come
to
you
'Cause
they
gon'
always
see
and
do
what
the
other
one

So
let
them
come

the
rest'll
just

Tweedle-dee,

Now

as
we

Check-mate,

Tweedle-dee,

Fucking
dummies
This
ain’t
chess
You
playin'
motherfucking
checkers
This
shit
is
all
day,
man,
it’s
too
easy
We
playing
chess,
you
playing
checkers
You
'bout
to
get
your
mother
fucking
asses
jumped
Fucking
punks
And
by
the
way
We
ain’t
just
talking
to
one
person
We
talking
to
every-motherfucking-body
who
wants
to
bring
it
'Cause
we
bring
it
into
anybody
who
wants
to
bring
it
So
bring
it
Don’t
pick
up
the
ball
if
you
don’t
wanna
play,
man
It’s
all
fucked
up
now
Fuck
I’m
supposed
to
do
now?
Huh?!
What
the
fuck
I'm
supposed
to
do?!
Yo,
we
out!
This
motherfucker,
man!
Just
won't
shut
up,
will
you?
Talking
'bout
I
owe
him
Bitch,
you
owe
me!
I'm
promotin'
you
right
now
Yo,
let's
put
the
nail
in
this
coffin!
I
don't
wanna
be
like
this
I
don't
really
wanna
hurt
no
feelings
But
I'm
only
being
real
when
I
say
Nobody
wants
to
hear
their
grandfather
rap
(nope)
And
old
men
have
heart
attacks
And
I
don't
wanna
be
responsible
for
that
So,
put
the
mic
down
and
walk
away
You
can
still
have
a
little
bit
of
dignity
I
would
never
claim
to
be
no
Ray
Benzino
An
83-year-old
fake
Pacino
So
how
can
he
hold
me
over
some
balcony
without
Blowing
his
lower
back
out
as
soon
as
he
goes
to
lift
me?
Please
don't—you'll
probably
fall
with
me
And
our
asses'll
both
be
history
But
then
again
you'd
finally
get
your
wish
‘Cause
you'll
be
all
over
the
street,
like
50
Cent
Fuckin'
punk
pussy!
Fuck
you,
chump!
Give
me
a
one-on-one,
see
if
I
don't
fuck
you
up
Tried
to
jump
the
Ruff
Ryders
and
they
cut
you
up
And
you
put
Jada
on
a
track,
that's
how
much
you
suck
Dick
in
the
industry,
swear
that
you
in
the
streets
hustlin'
You
sit
behind
a
fuckin'
desk
at
The
Source
butt-kissin'
And
beggin'
motherfuckers
for
guest
appearances
And
you
can't
even
get
the
clearances
'Cause
real
lyricists
don't
even
respect
you
or
take
you
serious
It's
not
that
we
don't
like
you—we
hate
you,
period
Talk
about
a
mid-life
crisis,
damn
Last
week
you
was
shakin'
Obie
Trice's
hand
Now

a
buster?
What
the
fuck's
with
that?
Get
on
a
track
dissin'

50's

And
askin'

what
I

about
indictments,
bite
me!
Bitch,

got
two
cases
and
probation—fight
me!
What
do
I
know
about
standin'
in
front
of
a
judge
like
a
man
Ready
to
take
whatever
sentence
he
hands?
What
you
know
about
your
wife
slicin'
her
wrists
Right
in
front
of
the
only
thing
that
you
have
in
this
world
A
little
girl?
And
I
put
that
on
her,
when
this
is
all
over
I
would
never
try
to
make
her
a
star
and
eat
off
her
I
don't
know
shit
about
no
choppin'
rocks
But
what
you
know
about
Hip
Hop
Shops
rockin'
spots
Where
you
the
only
white
boy
up
in
that
bitch
just
rippin'?
Pressin'
up
your
own
fliers
and
your
stickers,
stickin'
Them
bitches
up
after
spendin'
six
hours
at
Kinko's
Just
makin'
copies
of
your
covers
of
cassette
singles
To
sell
them
out
of
the
trunk
of
your
Tracer
Spendin'
your
whole
paychecks
at
Disc
Makers
What
you
know
about
being
bullied
over
half
your
life?
Oh,
that's
right,
you
should
know
what
that's
like
You're
half
white;
Vanilla
Ice,
spill
the
beans
and
rice
I'm
eatin'
you
alive
inside,
Jesus
Christ!
If
you're
that
much
of
a
gangsta,
put
the
mic
down!
You
should
be
out
killin'
motherfuckers
right
now
Kill
a
motherfucker
dead,
kill
him
dead,
bitch!
Shoot
'em
in
the
fuckin'
head—go
ahead,
bitch!
Slap
my
mom!
Slap
the
fuck
out
of
her!
She
can't
sue
you,
she
wouldn't
get
a
buck
out
of
ya
‘Cause
you're
broke
as
fuck,
you
suck,
you're
a
fuckin'
joke
If
you
was
really
sellin'
coke,
well,
then
what
the
fuck
You
stop
for,
dummy?
If
you
slew
some
crack
You'd
make
a
lot
more
money
than
you
do
from
rap
You'll
never
have
no
security,
you'll
never
be
famous
You'll
never
know
what
it's
like
to
be
rich
Life's
a
bitch,
ain't
it?
Raymond?
Here,
let
me
break
the
shit
down
in
layman's
Terms
for
you,
just
to
make
sure
that
you
can
understand
it
and
Canibus
ain't
using
too
many
complicated
fuckin'
words
for
you
Here,
let
me
slow
it
down
for
you
So
that
you
could
understand
if
I
say
it
slower
Let
it
go,
dog,
it's
over
I
don't
wanna
be
like
this
I
don't
really
wanna
hurt
no
feelings
But
I'm
only
being
real
when
I
say
Nobody
wants
to
hear
they
grandfather
rap
(nope)
And
old
men
have
heart
attacks
And
I
don't
wanna
be
responsible
for
that
So,
put
the
mic
down
and
walk
away
You
can
still
have
a
little
bit
of
dignity
Haha…
talking
'bout
I
have
motherfuckers
callin'
your
crib
Bitch,
you
ain't
even
got
a
fuckin'
crib!
You
ain't
even
got
a
fuckin'

fuckin'

Threatenin'
to
shut
me
down
at
your
lil'
fuckin'
Source
magazine,
if
I

back
on
you
and
attack
you
Bitch,

attacked
me
first!
Take
it
like
a
man,
and
shut
the
fuck
up!
And
fuck
your
little
magazine

I
don't
need
your
little
fuckin'

XXL's
number

And
y'all
can't
stand
it,
‘cause
they

bigger
than
y'all
Oh,
and
by
the
way,
how'd
I
look
on
the
VMA's?
When
you
was
watchin'
me
From
whatever
fuckin'
TV
you
was
watchin'
me
from
From
Boston…
the

streets
of
Boston
Fuckin'

And

us
scared
up
in
here,
motherfucker
Suck
our
motherfuckin'
dicks!
Oh!
And
for
those
that
don't
know
Don't
get
it
twisted,
y'all:
The
Source
has
a
white
owner!
It's
all
bad
now,
man,
it's
all
bad
But
y'all
done
fucked
up
now
Yeah!
Haha!
New
shit!
Ayo,
I
just
want
the
whole
world
to
know
That
I
did
not
start
this,
but
I
will
finish
it
Comin'
up,
it
never
mattered
what
color
you
was
If
you
could
spit,
then
you
could
spit
That's
it,
that's
what
it
was
Back
when
motherfuckers
was
straight
backpackin'
Cipherin',
fightin'
for
life
in
this
rap
For
the
mic
to
get
passed,
and
you
psyched
and
you
gassed
Then
you
hype,
‘cause
you
last
And
you
might
whoop
some
ass;
if
you
lost,
then
you
lost
Shake
hands
like
a
man
and
you
swallowed
it
When
the
Unsigned
Hype
column
in
The
Source
was
like
our
only
source
of
light
When
the
mics
used
to
mean
somethin',
a
four
was
like
You
were
the
shit,
now
it's
like
the
least
you
get
Three
and
a
half
now
just
means
you're
a
piece
of
shit
Four
and
a
half
or
five
means
you're
Biggie,
Jigga,
Nas
Or
Benzino—shit,
I
don't
even
think
you
realize
You're
playin'
with
motherfuckers'
lives
I
done
watched
Dre
get
fucked
on
The
Chronic
Probably
‘cause
I
was
on
it
Now
you
fucked
me
out
of
my
mics
twice,
I
let
it
slide
I
said
I
wouldn't
hold
my
fuckin'
breath
to
get
a
five
Shit,
I
was
right,
I'da
fuckin'
died
already
tryin'
I
swear
to
God,
I
never
lie,
I
bet
that's
why
You
let
that
bitch
give
me
that
bullshit
review
I
sat
and
took
it,
I
ain't
look
at
the
shit,
we
knew
You'd
probably
try
and
fuck

Obie

Fuck

talk
about
how
you're
puttin'
your
own
son
out
there
To
try
to
eat
off
him
because
you
missed
your
boat
You're
never
gonna
blow,
bitch,
you're
just
too
old
No
wonder
you're
sore
now,
lordy,
you're
bored
now
I'm
pushin'
30,
you're
kickin'
40's
door
down
Bitch,
this
is
war
now,
and
you'll
never
beat
me
All
you
do
is
cheat
me
out
of
Quotables
But
you
know
that
you'll
always
see
me
on
your
TV
‘Cause
you've
got
to
stay
up
'til
three
in
the
morning
To
see
your
video
played
once
on
BET
So,
hee
hee
hee,
who
has
the
last
laugh?
Aftermath,
yeah
So,
on
behalf
of
our
whole
staff,
kiss
our
asshole
cracks
We'll
never
fold
or
hold
back
Just
know
that
Benzino's
wack;
no
matter
how
many
times
I
say
his
name,
he'll
never
blow,
jack
You're
better
off
tryin'
to
bring
RSO
back
Look
at
your
track
record,
that's
how
far
it
goes
back
It's
extortion,
and
Ray
owns
a
portion
So,
half
of
the
staff
up
there
is
fresh
out
of
jail
from
Boston
Bullyin'
and
bossin'
Dave
like
a
slave
They
completely
brainwashed
him,
and
forced
him
to
stay
Locked
in
his
own
office
Afraid
of
the
softest,
fakest,
wannabe
gangsta
in
New
York
And
it's
pitiful,
‘cause
I
would
have
never
said
shit
if
you'd
Have
kept
your
mouth
shut,
bitch,
now
what?
Hit
it,
Clue!
Spit
it,
Slay!
New
shit,
Exclusive
Yo,
Lantern,
yo
Whoo
Kid
You
know
what
to
do
with
this
Use
it,
I'm
through,
this
is
stupid
I
can't
believe
I
stooped
to
this
bullshit
to
do
this
And
who
you
callin'
a
bitch,
bitch?
You
owe
me!
And
everyone
should
get
along
Okay,
children,
quiet
down,
quiet
down
Children,
I'd
like
to
introduce
our
new
substitute
teacher
for
the
day:
his
name
is
Mr.
Shady
Children,
quiet
down
please
Brian,
don't
throw
that!
(Shut
up!)
Mr.
Shady
will
be
your
new
substitute
While
Mr.
Kaniff
is
out
with
pneumonia
(He
got
AIDS!)
Good
luck,
Mr.
Shady!
Hi
there,
little
boys
and
girls!
(Fuck
you!)
Today
we're
gonna
learn
how
to
poison
squirrels
But
first,
I'd
like
you
to
meet
my
friend
Bob
(Huh?)
Say
hi,
Bob
("Hi,
Bob!")
Bob's
30
and
still
lives
with
his
mom
And
he
don't
got
a
job
'cause
Bob
sits
at
home
and
smokes
pot
But
his
twelve-year-old
brother
looks
up
to
him
an
awful
lot
And
Bob
likes
to
hang
out
at
the
local
waffle
spot
And
wait
in
the
parking
lot
for
waitresses
off
the
clock
When
it's
late
and
the
lot
gets
dark
And
fake
like
he
walks
his
dog
Drag
'em
in
the
woods
and
go
straight
to
the
chopping
blocks
(Ahh!)
And
even
if
they
escaped
and
they
got
the
cops
The
ladies
would
all
be
so
afraid,
they
would
drop
the
charge
'Til
one
night
Mrs.
Stacey
went
off
the
job
When
she
felt
someone
grab
her
whole
face
and
said
not
to
talk
But
Stacey
knew
it
was
Bob
and
said,
"Knock
it
off!"
But
Bob
wouldn't
knock
it
off,
'cause
he's
crazy
and
off
his
rocker
Crazier
than
Slim
Shady
is
off
the
vodka
You
couldn't
even
take
him
to
Dre's
to
get
Bob
a
doctor
He
grabbed
Stace'
by
the
legs
as
he
chopped
it
off
her
And
dropped
her
off
in
the
lake
for
the
cops
to
find
her
But
ever
since
the
day
Stacey
went
off
to
wander
They
never
found
her,
and
Bob
still
hangs
at
the
waffle
diner
And
that's
the
story
of
Bob
and
his
marijuana
And
what
it
might
do
to
you
So
see
if
the
squirrels
want
any—it's
bad
for
you
See,
children,
drugs
are
bad
(Come
on)
And
if
you
don't
believe
me,
ask
your
dad
(Ask
him,
man)
And
if
you
don't
believe
him,
ask
your
mom
(That's
right)
She'll
tell
you
how
she
does
'em
all
the
time
(She
will)
So
kids,
say
no
to
drugs
(That's
right)
So
you
don't
act
like
everyone
else
does
(Uh-huh)
Then
there's
really
nothin'
else
to
say
(Sing
along)
Drugs
are
just
bad,
mmkay?
My
penis
is
the
size
of
a
peanut,
have
you
seen
it?
Fuck
no,
you
ain't
seen
it,
it's
the
size
of
a
peanut
(Huh?)
Speakin'
of
peanuts,
you
know
what
else
is
bad
for
squirrels?
Ecstasy,
it's
the
worst
drug
in
the
world
If
someone
ever
offers
it
to
you,
don't
do
it
Kids,
two
hits'll
probably
drain
all
your
spinal
fluid
And
spinal
fluid
is
final,
you
won't
get
it
back
So
don't
get
attached,
it'll
attack
every
bone
in
your
back
Meet
Zach,
twenty-one
years
old
After
hangin'
out
with
some
friends
at
a
frat
party,
he
gets
bold
And
decides
to
try
five,
when
he's
bribed
by
five
guys
And
the
peer
pressure
will
win
every
time
you
try
to
fight
it
Suddenly,
he
starts
to
convulse
And
his
pulse
goes
into
hyperdrive
And
his
eyes
roll
back
in
his
skull
(blblblblblb)
His
back
starts
to
look
like
the
McDonald's
Arches
He's
on
Donald's
carpet,
layin'
horizontal
barfin'
(Bleh)
And
everyone
in
the
apartment
starts
laughin'
at
him
"Hey
Adam,
Zach
is
a
jackass,
look
at
him!"
'Cause
they
took
it
too,
so
they
think
it's
funny
So
they're
laughing
at
basically
nothing
Except
maybe
wasting
their
money
Meanwhile,
Zach's
in
a
coma,
the
action
is
over
And
his
back
and
his
shoulders
Hunched
up
like
he's
practicin'
yoga
And
that's
the
story
of
Zach,
the
ecstasy
maniac
So
don't
even
feed
that
to
squirrels,
class,
'cause
it's
bad
for
you
See,
children,
drugs
are
bad
(That's
right)
And
if
you
don't
believe
me,
ask
your
dad
(That's
right)
And
if
you
don't
believe
him,
ask
your
mom
(You
can)
She'll
tell
you
how
she
does
'em
all
the
time
(She
will)
So
kids
say
no
to
drugs
(Smoke
crack)
So
you
don't
act
like
everyone
else
does
(That's
right)
And
there's
really
nothin'
else
to
say
(But
umm…)
Drugs
are
just
bad,
mmkay?
And
last
but
not
least,
one
of
the
most
humongous
Problems
among
young
people
today
is
fungus
It
grows
from
cow
manure
They
pick
it
out,
wipe
it
off,
bag
it
up
And
you
put
it
right
in
your
mouth
and
chew
it
Yum
yum!
Then
you
start
to
see
some
dumb
stuff
And
everything
slows
down
when
you
eat
some
of
'em
And
sometimes
you
see
things
that
aren't
there
(Like
what?)
Like
fat
women
in
G-strings
with
orange
hair
(Mr.
Shady,
what's
a
G-string?)
It's
yarn,
Claire
Women
stick
'em
up
their
behinds,
go
out
and
wear
'em
(Huh?)
And
if
you
swallow
too
much
of
the
magic
mushrooms
Whoops,
did
I
say
magic
mushrooms?
I
meant
fungus
Your
tongue
gets
all
swoll
up
like
a
cow's
tongue
(How
come?)
'Cause
it
comes
from
a
cow's
dump
(Gross!)
See,
drugs
are
bad,
it's
a
common
fact
But
your
mom
and
dad
know
that's
all
that
I'm
good
at
(Oh!)
But
don't
be
me,
'cause
if
you
grow
up
and
you
go
and
OD
They're
gonna
come
for
me
and
I'ma
have
to
grow
a
goatee
And
get
a
disguise
and
hide,
'cause
it'll
be
my
fault
So
don't
do
drugs,
and
do
exactly
as
I
don't,
'cause
I'm
bad
for
you
See,
children,
drugs
are
bad
(Uh-huh)
And
if
you
don't
believe
me,
ask
your
dad
(Put
that
down!)
And
if
you
don't
believe
him,
ask
your
mom
(You
can
ask)
She'll
tell
you
how
she
does
'em
all
the
time
(And
she
will)
So
kids,
say
no
to
drugs
(Say
no)
So
you
don't
act
like
everyone
else
does
(Like
I
do)
And
there's
really
nothin'
else
to
say
(That's
right)
Drugs
are
just
bad,
mmkay?
Come
on,
children,
clap
along!
(Shut
up!)
Sing
along,
children!
(Suck
my
motherfuckin'
dick!)
Come
on,
clap
along
Drugs
are
just
bad,
drugs
are
just
bad
(South
Park
is
gonna
sue
me!)
So
don't
do
drugs!
(Kiss
my
motherfuckin'
ass!)
So
there'll
be
more
for
me
(Hippie!
Goddamn

(Mushrooms
killed
Kenny!)
(Uh,

fart
button's

Dre,
just
let
it
run
Ayo,
turn
the
beat
up
a
little
bit
Ayo
This
song
is
for
anyone...
Fuck
it,
just
shut
up
and
listen
Ayo
I
sit
back
with
this
pack
of
Zig-Zag's
and
this
bag
Of
this
weed,
it
gives
me
the
shit
needed
to
be
The
most
meanest
MC
on
this...
on
this
Earth
And
since
birth
I've
been
cursed
with
this
curse
to
just
curse
And
just
blurt
this
berserk
and
bizarre
shit
that
works
And
it
sells
and
it
helps
in
itself
to
relieve
All
this
tension,
dispensin'
these
sentences
Gettin'
this
stress
that's
been
eatin'
me
recently
off
Of
this
chest
and
I
rest
again
peacefully
(Peacefully)
But
at
least
have
the
decency
in
you
To
leave
me
alone,
when
you
freaks
see
me
out
In
the
streets
when
I'm
eatin'
or
feedin'
my
daughter
To
not
come
and
speak
to
me
(Speak
to
me),
I
don't
know
you
And
no,
I
don't
owe
you
a
motherfuckin'
thing
I'm
not
Mr.
N'Sync,
I'm
not
what
your
friends
think
I'm
not
Mr.
Friendly,
I
can
be
a
prick
If
you
tempt
me,
my
tank
is
on
empty
(Is
on
empty)
No
patience
is
in
me
and
if
you
offend
me
I'm
liftin'
you
ten
feet
(Liftin'
you
ten
feet)
in
the
air
I
don't
care
who
was
there
and
who
saw
me
just
jaw
you
Go
call
you
a
lawyer,
file
you
a
lawsuit
I'll
smile
in
the
courtroom
and
buy
you
a
wardrobe
I'm
tired
of
all
you
(Of
all
you),
I
don't
mean
to
be
mean
But
that's
all
I
can
be,
it's
just
me
And
I
am
whatever
you
say
I
am
If
I
wasn't,
then
why
would
I
say
I
am?
In
the
paper,
the
news,
every
day
I
am
Radio
won't
even
play
my
jam
'Cause
I
am
whatever
you
say
I
am
If
I
wasn't,
then
why
would
I
say
I
am?
In
the
paper,
the
news,
every
day
I
am
I
don't
know,
that's
just
the
way
I
am
Sometimes
I
just
feel
like
my
father,
I
hate
to
be
bothered
With
all
of
this
nonsense,
it's
constant
And,
"Oh,
it's
his
lyrical
content
The
song
'Guilty
Conscience'
has
gotten
such
rotten
responses."
And
all
of
this
controversy
circles
me
And
it
seems
like
the
media
immediately
Points
a
finger
at
me
(Finger
at
me)
So
I
point
one
back
at
'em,
but
not
the
index
or
pinkie
Or
the
ring
or
the
thumb,
it's
the
one
you
put
up
When
you
don't
give
a
fuck,
when
you
won't
just
put
up
With
the
bullshit
they
pull,
'cause
they
full
of
shit
too
When
a
dude's
gettin'
bullied
and
shoots
up
his
school
And
they
blame
it
on
Marilyn
(On
Marilyn)
and
the
heroin
Where
were
the
parents
at?
And
look
where
it's
at!
Middle
America,
now
it's
a
tragedy
Now
it's
so
sad
to
see,
an
upper-class
city
Havin'
this
happenin'
(This
happenin')
then
attack
Eminem
'cause
I
rap
this
way
(Rap
this
way)
but
I'm
glad
'Cause
they
feed
me
the
fuel
that
I
need
for
the
fire
to
burn
And
it's
burnin',
and
I
have
returned
And
I
am
whatever
you
say
I
am
If
I
wasn't,
then
why
would
I
say
I
am?
In
the
paper,
the
news,
every

I

Radio
won't

I

I
don't
know,
that's
just
the
way
I
am
I'm
so
sick
and
tired
of
bein'
admired
That
I
wish
that
I
would
just
die
or
get
fired
And
dropped
from
my
label,
let's
stop
with
the
fables
I'm
not
gonna
be
able
to
top
a
"My
Name
Is"
And
pigeon-holed
into
some
poppy
sensation
To
cop
me
rotation
at
rock
'n'
roll
stations
And
I
just
do
not
got
the
patience
(Got
the
patience)
To
deal
with
these
cocky
Caucasians
Who
think
I'm
some
wigger
who
just
tries
to
be
black
'cause
I
talk
With
an
accent
and
grab
on
my
balls
so
they
always
Keep
askin'
the
same
fuckin'
questions
(Fuckin'
questions)
What
school
did
I
go
to,
what
hood
I
grew
up
in
The
why,
the
who,
what,
when,
the
where
and
the
how
'Til
I'm
grabbin'
my
hair
and
I'm
tearin'
it
out
'Cause
they
drivin'
me
crazy
(Drivin'
me
crazy),
I
can't
take
it
I'm
racin',
I'm
pacin',
I
stand
and
I
sit
And
I'm
thankful
for
every
fan
that
I
get
But
I
can't
take
a
shit
in
the
bathroom
without
Someone
standin'
by
it!
(Standin'
by
it)
No,
I
won't
sign
your
autograph
You
can
call
me
an
asshole,
I'm
glad
'Cause
I

Wanna

nails
through

Try

(Huh?)
My
brain's
dead
weight,
I'm
tryna
get
my
head
straight
But
I
can't
figure
out
which
Spice
Girl
I
want
to
impregnate
(Oh)
And
Dr.
Dre
said,
"Slim
Shady,
you
a
basehead"
(Uh-uh)
"Then
why's
your
face
red?
Man,
you
wasted"
Well,
since
age
12,
I
felt
like
I'm
someone
else
'Cause
I
hung
my
original
self
from
the
top
bunk
with
a
belt
Got
pissed
off
and
ripped
Pamela
Lee's
tits
off
And
smacked
her
so
hard
I
knocked
her
clothes
backwards
like
Kris
Kross
I
smoke
a
fat
pound
of
grass,
and
fall
on
my
ass
Faster
than
a
fat
bitch
who
sat
down
too
fast
Come
here,
slut;
"Shady,
wait
a
minute,
that's
my
girl,
dawg"
I
don't
give
a
fuck,
God
sent
me
to
piss
the

off

My
English
teacher
wanted
to
flunk
me
in
junior
high
(Shh)
Thanks
a
lot,
next
semester
I'll
be
35
I
smacked
him
in
his
face
with
an
eraser,
chased
him
with
a
stapler
And
stapled
his
nuts
to
a
stack
of
paper
(Ow)
Walked
in
the
strip
club,
had
my
jacket
zipped
up
Flashed
the
bartender,
then
stuck
my
dick
in
the
tip
cup
Extraterrestrial,
running
over
pedestrians
in
a
spaceship
While
they're
screaming
at
me,
"Let's
just
be
friends"
99
percent
of
my
life,
I
was
lied
to
I
just
found
out
my
mom
does
more
dope
than
I
do
(Damn)
I
told
her
I'd
grow
up
to
be
a
famous
rapper
Make
a
record
about
doin'
drugs
and
name
it
after
her
(Oh,
thank
you)
You
know
you
blew
up
when
the
women
rush
your
stands
And
try
to
touch
your
hands
like
some
screamin'
Usher
fans
(Ahh,
ahh,
ahh)
This
guy
at
White
Castle
asked
for
my
autograph
(Dude,
can
I
get
your
autograph?)
So
I
signed
it,
"Dear
Dave,
thanks
for
the
support,
asshole"

Stop
the

this
kid
needs
to
be
locked
away
(Get
him)
Dr.
Dre,
don't
just
stand
there,
operate
I'm
not
ready
to
leave,
it's
too
scary
to
die
(Fuck
that)
I'll
have
to
be
carried
inside
the
cemetery
and
buried
alive
(Huh,
yup)
Am
I
comin'
or
goin'?
I
can
barely
decide
I
just
drank
a
fifth
of
vodka,
dare
me
to
drive?
(Go
ahead)
All
my
life
I
was
very
deprived
I
ain't
had
a
woman
in
years
and
my
palms
are
too
hairy
to
hide
(Whoops)
Clothes
ripped
like
the
Incredible
Hulk
I
spit
when
I
talk,
I'll
fuck
anything
that
walks
(Come
here)
When
I
was
little,
I
used
to
get
so
hungry
I
would
throw
fits
How
you
gonna
breastfeed
me,
Mom?
You
ain't
got
no
tits
I
lay
awake
and
strap
myself
in
the
bed
With
a
bulletproof
vest
on
and
shoot
myself
in
the
head
(Bang)
'Cause
I'm
steamin'
mad
(Grr)
And
by
the
way,
when
you
see
my
dad
(Yeah?)
Tell
him
that
I
slit
his
throat
in
this
dream
I
had

My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
And
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'd
all
be
gray
But
your
picture
on

It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's

Dear
Slim,
I
wrote
you,
but
you
still
ain't
callin'
I
left
my
cell,
my
pager
and
my
home
phone
at
the
bottom
I
sent
two
letters
back
in
autumn,
you
must
not've
got
'em
There
probably
was
a
problem
at
the
post
office
or
somethin'
Sometimes
I
scribble
addresses
too
sloppy
when
I
jot
'em
But
anyways,
fuck
it,
what's
been
up,
man?
How's
your
daughter?
My
girlfriend's
pregnant
too,
I'm
'bout
to
be
a
father
If
I
have
a
daughter,
guess
what
I'ma
call
her?
I'ma
name
her
Bonnie
I
read
about
your
Uncle
Ronnie
too,
I'm
sorry
I
had
a
friend
kill
himself
over
some
bitch
who
didn't
want
him
I
know
you
probably
hear
this
every
day,
but
I'm
your
biggest
fan
I
even
got
the
underground
shit
that
you
did
with
Skam
I
got
a
room
full
of
your
posters
and
your
pictures,
man
I
like
the
shit
you
did
with
Rawkus
too,
that
shit
was
phat
Anyways,
I
hope
you
get
this,
man,
hit
me
back
Just
to
chat,
truly
yours,
your
biggest
fan,
this
is
Stan
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
And
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'd
all
be
gray
But
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's
not
so
bad
Dear
Slim,
you
still
ain't
called
or
wrote,
I
hope
you
have
a
chance
I
ain't
mad,
I
just
think
it's
fucked
up
you
don't
answer
fans
If
you
didn't
want
to
talk
to
me
outside
your
concert,
you
didn't
have
to
But
you
coulda
signed
an
autograph
for
Matthew
That's
my
little
brother,
man,
he's
only
six
years
old
We
waited
in
the
blisterin'
cold
For
you,
for
four
hours,
and
you
just
said
no
That's
pretty
shitty,
man,
you're
like
his
fuckin'
idol
He
wants
to
be
just
like
you,
man,
he
likes
you
more
than
I
do
I
ain't
that
mad,
though
I
just
don't
like
bein'
lied
to
Remember
when
we
met
in
Denver?
You
said
if
I'd
write
you,
you
would
write
back
See,
I'm
just
like
you
in
a
way:
I
never
knew
my
father
neither
He
used
to
always
cheat
on
my
mom
and
beat
her
I
can
relate
to
what
you're
sayin'
in
your
songs
So
when
I
have
a
shitty
day,
I
drift
away
and
put
'em
on
‘Cause
I
don't
really
got
shit
else
So
that
shit
helps
when
I'm
depressed
I
even
got
a
tattoo
with
your
name
across
the
chest
Sometimes
I
even
cut
myself
to
see
how
much
it
bleeds
It's
like
adrenaline,
the
pain
is
such
a
sudden
rush
for
me
See,
everything
you
say
is
real,
and
I
respect
you
‘cause
you
tell
it
My
girlfriend's
jealous
'cause
I
talk
about
you
24/7
But
she
don't
know
you
like
I
know
you,
Slim,
no
one
does
She
don't
know
what
it
was
like
for
people
like
us
growin'
up
You
gotta
call
me,
man,
I'll
be
the
biggest
fan
you'll
ever
lose
Sincerely
yours,
Stan—P.S.:
We
should
be
together
too
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
And
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'd
all
be
gray
But
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's
not
so

Dear
Mr.
I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll
be
the
last
package
I
ever
send
your
ass
It's
been
six
months,
and
still
no
word—I
don't
deserve
it?
I
know
you
got
my
last
two
letters
I
wrote
the
addresses
on
'em
perfect
So
this
is
my
cassette
I'm
sendin'
you,
I
hope
you
hear
it
I'm
in
the
car
right
now,
I'm
doin'
90
on
the
freeway
Hey,
Slim,
I
drank
a
fifth
of
vodka,
you
dare
me
to
drive?
You
know
the
song
by
Phil
Collins,
"In
the
Air
of
the
Night"
About
that
guy
who
coulda
saved
that
other
guy
from
drownin'
But
didn't,
then
Phil
saw
it
all,
then
at
a
show
he
found
him?
That's
kinda
how
this
is:
you
coulda
rescued
me
from
drownin'
Now
it's
too
late,
I'm
on
a
thousand
downers
now—I'm
drowsy
And
all
I
wanted
was
a
lousy
letter
or
a
call
I
hope
you
know
I
ripped
all
of
your
pictures
off
the
wall
I
loved
you,
Slim,
we
coulda
been
together—think
about
it!
You
ruined
it
now,
I
hope
you
can't
sleep
and
you
dream
about
it
And
when
you
dream
I
hope
you
can't
sleep
and
you
scream
about
it
I
hope
your
conscience
eats
at
you
and
you
can't
breathe
without
me
See,
Slim—shut
up,
bitch!
I'm
tryin'
to
talk
Hey,
Slim,
that's
my
girlfriend
screamin'
in
the
trunk
But
I
didn't
slit
her
throat,
I
just
tied
her
up—See?
I
ain't
like
you
‘Cause
if
she
suffocates
she'll
suffer
more
and
then
she'll
die
too
Well,
gotta
go,
I'm
almost
at
the
bridge
now
Oh,
shit,
I
forgot—how
am
I
supposed
to
send
this
shit
out?!
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
And
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'd
all
be
gray
But
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's
not
so
bad
Dear
Stan,
I
meant
to
write
you
sooner,
but
I
just
been
busy
You
said
your
girlfriend's
pregnant
now,
how
far
along
is
she?
Look,
I'm
really
flattered
you
would
call
your
daughter
that
And
here's
an
autograph
For
your
brother;
I
wrote
it
on
a
Starter
cap
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
see
you
at
the
show,
I
must've
missed
you
Don't
think
I
did
that
shit
intentionally
just
to
diss
you
But
what's
this
shit
you
said
about
you
like
to
cut
your
wrists
too?
I
say
that
shit
just
clownin',
dawg,
come
on,
how
fucked
up
is
you?
You
got
some
issues,
Stan,
I
think
you
need
some
counselin'
To
help
your
ass
from
bouncin'
Off
the
walls
when
you
get
down
some
And
what's
this
shit
about
us
meant
to
be
together?
That
type
of
shit'll
make
me
not
want
us
to
meet
each
other
I
really
think
you
and
your
girlfriend
need
each
other
Or
maybe
you
just
need
to
treat
her
better
I
hope
you
get
to
read
this
letter,
I
just
hope
it
reaches
you
in
time
Before
you
hurt
yourself,
I
think
that
you'll
be
doin'
just
fine
If
you
relax
a
little,
I'm
glad
I
inspire
you,
but
Stan
Why
are
you
so
mad?
Try
to
understand
That
I
do
want
you
as
a
fan
I
just
don't
want
you
to
do
some
crazy
shit
I
seen
this
one
shit
on
the
news
a
couple
weeks
ago
that
made
me
sick
Some
dude
was
drunk
and
drove
his
car
over
a
bridge
And
had
his
girlfriend
in
the
trunk
And
she
was
pregnant
with
his
kid
And
in
the
car
they
found
a
tape,
but
they
didn't
say
who
it
was
to
Come
to
think
about
it,
his
name
was—it
was
you,
damn…
Look,
if
you
had
one
shot
or
one
opportunity
To
seize
everything
you
ever
wanted
in
one
moment
Would
you
capture
it,
or
just
let
it
slip?
Yo
His
palms
are
sweaty,
knees
weak,
arms
are
heavy
There's
vomit
on
his
sweater
already,
mom's
spaghetti
He's
nervous,
but
on
the
surface
he
looks
calm
and
ready
To
drop
bombs,
but
he
keeps
on
forgetting
What
he
wrote
down,
the
whole
crowd
goes
so
loud
He
opens
his
mouth,
but
the
words
won't
come
out
He's
choking,
how?
Everybody's
joking
now
The
clock's
run
out,
time's
up,
over—blaow!
Snap
back
to
reality,
ope
there
goes
gravity,
ope
There
goes
Rabbit,
he
choked,
he's
so
mad
but
he
won't
Give
up
that
easy,
no,
he
won't
have
it,
he
knows
His
whole
back's
to
these
ropes,
it
don't
matter,
he's
dope
He
knows
that
but
he's
broke,
he's
so
stagnant,
he
knows
When
he
goes
back
to
this
mobile
home,
that's
when
it's
Back
to
the
lab
again
yo,
this
whole
rhapsody
Better
go
capture
this
moment
and
hope
it
don't
pass
him,
and
You
better
lose
yourself
in
the
music
The
moment,
you
own
it,
you
better
never
let
it
go
(Go!)
You
only
get
one
shot,
do
not
miss
your
chance
to
blow
This
opportunity
comes

yo
You
better…
His
soul's
escaping
through
this
hole
that
is
gaping
This
world
is
mine
for
the
taking,
make
me
king
As
we
move
toward
a
New
World
Order
A
normal
life
is
boring;
but
superstardom's
Close
to
post-mortem,
it
only
grows
harder
Homie
grows
hotter,
he
blows,
it's
all
over
These
hoes
is
all
on
him,
coast-to-coast
shows
He's
known
as
the
Globetrotter,
lonely
roads
God
only
knows,
he's
grown
farther
from
home,
he's
no
father
He
goes
home
and
barely
knows
his
own
daughter
But
hold
your
nose,
'cause
here
goes
the
cold
water
These
hoes
don't
want
him
no
mo',
he's
cold
product
They
moved
on
to
the
next
schmoe
who
flows
He
nose-dove
and
sold
nada,
and
so
the
soap
opera
Is
told,
it
unfolds,
I
suppose
it's
old,
partner
But
the
beat
goes
on:
da-da-dom,
da-dom,
dah-dah,
dah-dah
You
better
lose
yourself
in
the
music
The
moment,
you
own
it,
you
better
never
let
it
go
(Go!)
You
only
get
one
shot,
do
not
miss
your
chance
to

No
more
games,
I'ma
change
what
you
call
rage
Tear
this
motherfuckin'
roof
off
like
two
dogs
caged
I
was
playin'
in
the
beginning,
the
mood
all
changed
I've
been
chewed
up
and
spit
out
and
booed
off
stage
But
I
kept
rhymin'
and
stepped
right
in
the
next
cypher
Best
believe
somebody's
payin'
the
Pied
Piper
All
the
pain
inside
amplified
by
the
Fact
that
I
can't
get
by
with
my
nine-to-
Five
and
I
can't
provide
the
right
type
of
life
for
my
family
'Cause
man,
these
goddamn
food
stamps
don't
buy
diapers
And
there's
no
movie,
there's
no
Mekhi
Phifer,
this
is
my
life
And
these
times
are
so
hard,
and
it's
gettin'
even
harder
Tryna
feed
and
water
my
seed,
plus
teeter-totter
Caught
up
between
bein'
a
father
and
a
prima

Baby
mama
drama,
screamin'
on
her,
too
much
for
me
to

Stay
in
one
spot,
another
day
of
monotony's
Gotten
me
to
the
point
I'm
like
a
snail,
I've
got
To
formulate
a
plot
or
end
up
in
jail
or
shot
Success
is
my
only
motherfuckin'
option—failure's
not
Mom,
I
love
you,
but
this
trailer's

To

I
cannot
grow
old
in
Salem's
Lot
So
here
I
go,
it's
my
shot:

shoe
clean,
got
a
routine
goin'
Still
got
a
few
chunks
on
them
shoestrings
showin'
I
was
dehydrated
'til
the
beat
vibrated
I
was
revived
as
soon
as
this
bitch
gyrated
Them
hips
and
licked
them
lips,
and
that
was
it
I
had
to
get
Nate
Dogg
here
to
sing
some
shit
Two
to
the
one,
from
the
one
to
the
three
I
like
good
pussy
and
I
like
good
tree
Smoke
so
much
weed,
you
wouldn't
believe
And
I
get
mo'
ass
than
a
toilet
seat
Three
to
the
one,
from
the
one
to
the
three
I
met
a
bad
bitch
last
night
in
the
D
Let
me
tell
you
how
I
made
her
leave
with
me:
Conversation
and
Hennessy
I've
been
to
the
motherfuckin'
mountaintop
Heard
motherfuckers
talk,
seen
'em
drop
If
I
ain't
got
a
weapon
I'ma
pick
up
a
rock
And
when
I
bust
yo'
ass
I'm
gon'
continue
to
rock
Get
your
ass
off
the
wall
with
your
two
left
feet
It's
real
easy,
just
follow
the
beat
Don't
let
that
fine
girl
pass
you
by
Look
real
close
'cause
strobe
lights
lie
We
'bout
to
have
a
party
(Turn
the
music
up)
Let's
get
it
started
(Go
'head
and
shake
your
butt)
I'm
lookin'
fo'
a
girl
with
a
body
and
a
sexy
strut
Wanna
get
it
poppin',
baby?
Step
right
up
Some
girls,
they
act
retarded
Some
girls
are
'bout
it,
'bout
it
I'm
lookin'
fo'
a
girl
that
will
do
whatever
the
fuck
I
say,
every
day
she

givin'
it

(Now)
Shake

Come

Come

shake
that
ass
for
me
I'm
a
menace,
a
dentist,
an
oral
hygienist
Open
your
mouth
for
about
four
or
five
minutes
Take
a
little
bit
of
this
fluoride
rin-inse
Swish,
but
don't
spit
it;
swallow
it
and
now
finish
Yeah,

and
Nate
D-O
Double-G
Lookin'

some
double
D's
Pop

champagne
and
a

E's
Slip

We

(Turn

music
up)
Let's
get
it
started
(Go
'head
and
shake
your
butt)
I'm
lookin'
fo'
a
girl
I
can
fuck
in
my
Hummer
truck
Apple
Bottom
jeans
and

big

Some
girls,

(Man,

you!)
Some
girls
are
'bout
it,
'bout
it
I
want
a
bitch
to
sit
at
the
crib
with
no
panties
on
Knows
that
she
can,
but
she
won't
say
no
(Now)
Look
at
this
lady
all
in
front
of
me,
sexy
as
can
be
Tonight
I
want
a
slut,
would
you
be
mine?
Heard
you
was
freaky
from
a
friend
of
mine
Now,
I
hope
you
don't
get
mad
at
me
But
I
told
Nate
you
was
a
freak
He
said
he
wants
a
slut,
hope
you
don't
mind
I
told
him
how
you
like
it
from
behind
(Now)
Shake

Come

Oh,

Come

We
'bout
to
have
a
party
(Turn

up)
Let's

started
(Go

I'm

and

Wanna

Step

Some

Some

are
'bout

'bout
it
I'm
lookin'

that
will
do
whatever
the

I
say,
every
day
she
be
givin'
it
up
There
she
go,
shakin'
that
ass
on
the
flo'
Bumpin'
and
grindin'
that
pole
The
way
she's
grindin'
that
pole
I
think
I'm
losin'
control
God!
I
ain't
leavin'
without
you,
bitch!
Comin'
home
with
me!
And
my
boy,
and
his
boy
–
and
his
boy,
and
his
girl
Ha-ha,
Nate
Dogg!
These
ideas
are
nightmares
to
white
parents
Whose
worst
fear
is
a
child
with
dyed
hair
and
who
likes
earrings
Like
whatever
they
say
has
no
bearing
It's
so
scary
in
a
house
that
allows
no
swearing
To
see
him
walkin'
around
with
his
headphones
blarin'
Alone
in
his
own
zone,
cold
and
he
don't
care,
he's
A
problem
child,
and
what
bothers
him
all
comes
out
When
he
talks
about
his
fuckin'
dad
walkin'
out
(Bitch!)
'Cause
he
hates
him
so
bad
that
he
blocks
him
out
If
he
ever
saw
him
again
he'd
probably
knock
him
out
His
thoughts
are
wacked,
he's
mad
so
he's
talkin'
back
Talkin'
black,
brainwashed
from
rock
and
rap
He
sags
his
pants,
do-rags
and
a
stockin'
cap
His
step-father
hit
him
so
he
socked
him
back
And
broke
his
nose,
his
house
is
a
broken
home
There's
no
control,
he
just
lets
his
emotions
go
(Come
on!)
Sing
with
me
(Sing!),
sing
for
the
year
(Sing
it!)
Sing
for
the
laughter
and
sing
for
the
tear
(Come
on!)
Sing
it
with
me,
it's
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
Entertainment
is
changin',
intertwinin'
with
gangsters
In
the
land
of
the
killers
a
sinner's
mind
is
a
sanctum
Holy
or
unholy,
only
have
one
homie
Only
this
gun,
lonely
‘cause
don't
anyone
know
me
Yet
everybody
just
feels
like
they
can
relate
(Huh-uh)
I
guess
words
are
a
motherfucker,
they
can
be
great
Or
they
can
degrade,
or
even
worse,
they
can
teach
hate
It's
like
these
kids
hang
on
every
single
statement
we
make
Like
they
worship
us,
plus
all
the
stores
ship
us
platinum
Now
how
the
fuck
did
this
metamorphosis
happen?
From
standin'
on
corners
and
porches
just
rappin'
To
havin'
a
fortune,
no
more
kissin'
ass
But
then
these
critics
crucify
you
(Yep),
journalists
try
to
burn
you
Fans
turn
on
you,
attorneys
all
want
a
turn
at
you
To
get
they
hands
on
every
dime
you
have
They
want
you
to
lose
your
mind
every
time
you
mad
So
they
can
try
to
make
you
out
to
look
like
a
loose
cannon
Any
dispute
won't
hesitate
to
produce
handguns
That's
why
these
prosecutors
wanna
convict
me
Strictly
just
to
get
me
off
of
these
streets
quickly
But
all
they
kids
be
listenin'
to
me
religiously
So
I'm
signin'
CDs
while
police
fingerprint
me
They're
for
the
judge's
daughter,
but
his
grudge
is
against
me
If
I'm
such
a
fuckin'
menace,
this
shit
doesn't
make
sense,
B
It's
all
political,
if
my
music
is
literal
And
I'm
a
criminal,
how
the
fuck
can
I
raise
a
little
girl?
I
couldn't,
I
wouldn't
be
fit
to
You're
full
of
shit
too,
Guerrera,
that
was
a
fist
that
hit
you!
(Bitch!)
(Come
on!)
Sing
with
me
(Sing!),
sing
for
the
year
(Sing
it!)
Sing
for
the
laughter
and
sing
for
the
tear
(Sing
that
shit!)
Sing
it
with
me,
it's
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
They
say
music
can
alter
moods
and
talk
to
you
Well,
can
it
load
a
gun
up
for
you
and
cock
it
too?
Well,
if
it
can,
then
the
next
time
you
assault
a
dude
Just
tell
the
judge
it
was
my
fault
and
I'll
get
sued
See,
what
these
kids
do
is
hear
about
us
totin'
pistols
And
they
wanna
get
one
‘cause
they
think
the
shit's
cool
Not
knowin'
we
really
just
protectin'
ourselves
We
entertainers,
of
course
the
shit's
affectin'
our
sales
You
ignoramus,
but
music
is
reflection
of
self
We
just
explain
it,
and
then
we
get
our
checks
in
the
mail
It's
fucked
up,
ain't
it?
How
we
can
come
from
practically
nothin'
To
bein'
able
to
have
any
fuckin'
thing
that
we
wanted
That's
why
we
sing
for
these
kids
who
don't
have
a
thing
Except
for
a
dream
and
a
fuckin'
rap
magazine
(Ha-ha!)
Who
post
pin-up
pictures
on
they
walls
all
day
long
Idolize
they
favorite
rappers
and
know
all
they
songs
Or
for
anyone
who's
ever
been
through
shit
in
they
lives
So
they
sit
and
they
cry
at
night,
wishin'
they'd
die
'Til
they
throw
on
a
rap
record
and
they
sit
and
they
vibe
We're
nothin'
to
you,
but
we're
the
fuckin'
shit
in
they
eyes
That's
why
we
seize
the
moment,
try
to
freeze
it
and
own
it
Squeeze
it
and
hold
it
‘cause
we
consider
these
minutes
golden
And
maybe
they'll
admit
it
when
we're
gone,
just
let
our
spirits
Live
on
through
our
lyrics
that
you
hear
in
our
songs,
and
we
can…
Sing
with
me
(Sing!),
sing
for
the
year
(Sing
it!)
Sing
for
the
laughter
and
sing
for
the

(Come
on!)
Sing
it
with
me,
it's
just

Maybe
tomorrow
the

Lord
will
take

See

Shady,
I'm
chopped
liver
Well,
if
you
want
Shady,
this
is
what
I'll
give
ya
A
little
bit
of
weed
mixed
with
some
hard
liquor
Some
vodka
that'll
jump
start
my
heart
quicker
Than
a
shock
when
I
get
shocked
at
the
hospital
By
the
doctor
when
I'm
not
co-operating
When
I'm
rocking
the
table
while
he's
operating
(Hey!)
You
waited
this
long,
now
stop
debating
‘Cause
I'm
back,
I'm
on
the
rag
and
ovulating
I
know
that
you
got
a
job,
Ms.
Cheney
But
your
husband's
heart
problem's
complicating
So
the
FCC
won't
let
me
be
Or
let
me
be
me,
so
let
me
see
They
try
to
shut
me
down
on
MTV
But
it
feels
so
empty
without
me
So,
come
on
and
dip,
bum
on
your
lips
Fuck
that!
Cum
on
your
lips
and
some
on
your
tits
And
get
ready,
‘cause
this
shit's
about
to
get
heavy
I
just
settled
all
my
lawsuits—fuck
you,
Debbie!
Now
this
looks
like
a
job
for
me
So
everybody,
just
follow
me
‘Cause
we
need
a
little
controversy
‘Cause
it
feels
so
empty

I
said
this
looks

for

So

need
a

Little
hellions,
kids
feeling
rebellious
Embarrassed
their
parents
still
listen
to
Elvis
They
start
feeling
like
prisoners
helpless
'Til
someone
comes
along
on
a
mission
and
yells,
"Bitch!"
A
visionary,
vision
is
scary
Could
start
a
revolution,
polluting
the
airwaves
A
rebel,
so
just
let
me
revel
and
bask
In
the
fact
that
I
got
everyone
kissing
my
ass
(*smack*)​​
And
it's
a
disaster,
such
a
catastrophe
For
you
to
see
so
damn
much
of
my
ass—you
asked
for
me?
Well,
I'm
back,
na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix
your
bent
antenna,
tune
it
in,
and
then
I'm
gonna
Enter
in,
and
up
under
your
skin
like
a
splinter
The
center
of
attention,
back
for
the
winter
I'm
interesting,
the
best
thing
since
wrestling
Infesting
in
your
kid's
ears
and
nesting
Testing,
"Attention
please"
Feel
the
tension
soon
as
someone
mentions
me
Here's
my
ten
cents,
my
two
cents
is
free
A
nuisance,
who
sent?
You
sent
for
me?
Now
this
looks
like
a
job
for
me
So
everybody,
just
follow
me
‘Cause
we
need
a
little
controversy
‘Cause
it
feels
so
empty
without
me

A
tisk-it
a
task-it,
I'll
go
tit
for
tat
with
Anybody
who's
talking
"this
shit,
that
shit"
Chris
Kirkpatrick,
you
can
get
your
ass
kicked
Worse
than
them
little
Limp
Bizkit
bastards
And
Moby?
You
can
get
stomped
by
Obie
You
36-year-old
baldheaded
fag,
blow
me
You
don't
know
me,
you're
too
old,
let
go
It's
over,
nobody
listens
to
techno
Now
let's
go,
just
give
me
the
signal
I'll
be
there
with
a
whole
list
full
of
new
insults
I've
been
dope,
suspenseful
with
a
pencil
Ever
since
Prince
turned
himself
into
a
symbol
But
sometimes
the
shit
just
seems
Everybody
only
wants
to
discuss
me
So
this
must
mean
I'm
disgusting
But
it's
just
me,
I'm
just
obscene
Though
I'm
not
the
first
king
of
controversy
I
am
the
worst
thing
since
Elvis
Presley
To
do
black
music
so
selfishly
And
use
it
to
get
myself
wealthy
(Hey!)
There's
a
concept
that
works
Twenty
million
other
white
rappers
emerge
But
no
matter
how
many
fish
in
the
sea
It'd
be
so
empty
without
me
Now
this
looks
like
a
job
for
me
So
everybody,
just
follow
me
‘Cause
we
need
a
little
controversy
‘Cause
it
feels

Step
by

heart
to
heart
Left,
right,

we
all
fall
down
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left,
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win,
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
I'm
supposed
to
be
the
soldier
who
never
blows
his
composure
Even
though
I
hold
the
weight
of
the
whole
world
on
my
shoulders
I
ain't
never
supposed
to
show
it,
my
crew
ain't
supposed
to
know
it
Even
if
it
means
goin'
toe-to-toe
with
a
Benzino
It
don't
matter,
I
never
drag
'em
in
battles
that
I
can't
handle
'Less
I
absolutely
have
to,
I'm
supposed
to
set
an
example
I
need
to
be
the
leader,
my
crew
looks
for
me
to
guide
'em
If
some
shit
ever
does
pop
off,
I'm
supposed
to
be
beside
'em
That
Ja
shit,
I
tried
to
squash
it,
it
was
too
late
to
stop
it
There's
a
certain
line
you
just
don't
cross,
and
he
crossed
it
I
heard
him
say
Hailie's
name
on
a
song
and
I
just
lost
it
It
was
crazy,
the
shit
went
way
beyond
some
JAY-Z
and
Nas
shit
And
even
though
the
battle
was
won,
I
feel
like
we
lost
it
I
spent
so
much
energy
on
it,
honestly
I'm
exhausted
And
I'm
so
caught
in
it
that
I
almost
feel
I'm
the
one
who
caused
it
This
ain't
what
I'm
in
hip-hop
for,
that's
not
why
I
got
in
it
That
was
never
my
object,
for
someone
to
get
killed
Why
would
I
wanna
destroy
something
I
helped
build?
That
wasn't
my
intentions,
my
intentions
were
good
I
went
through
my
whole
career
without
ever
mentionin'
****
And
that
was
just
outta
respect,
for
not
runnin'
my
mouth
And
talkin'
about
somethin'
that
I
knew
nothin'
about
Plus
Dre
told
me
stay
out,
this
just
wasn't
my
beef
So
I
did,
I
just
fell
back,
watched
and
gritted
my
teeth
While
he's
all
over
TV,
down-talkin'
the
man
Who
literally
saved
my
life,
like
fuck
it,
I
understand
This
is
business,
and
this
shit
just
isn't
none
of
my
business
But
still
knowin'
the
shit
could
pop
off
at
any
minute,
‘cause—
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left,
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win,
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
There
used
to
be
a
time
when
you
could
just
say
a
rhyme
and
Wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
one
of
your
people
dyin'
But
now
it's
elevated,
‘cause
once
you
put
someone's
kids
in
it
The
shit
gets
escalated
—
it
ain't
just
words
no
more,
is
it?
It's
a
different
ballgame,
you
call
names
and
you
ain't
just
rappin'
We
actually
tried
to
stop
the
50
and
Ja
beef
from
happenin'
Me
and
Dre
had
sat
with
him,
kicked
it
and
had
a
chat
with
him
And
asked
him
not
to
start
it,
he
wasn't
gonna
go
after
him
Until
Ja
started
yappin'
in
magazines
how
he
stabbed
him
Fuck
it,
50,
smash
him!
Mash
on
him,
let
him
have
it
Meanwhile
my
attention's
pulled
in
another
direction
Some
receptionist
at
The
Source
who
answers
phones
at
his
desk
Has
an
erection
for
me
and
thinks
that
I'll
be
his
resurrection
Tries
to
blow
the
dust
off
his
mic
and
make
a
new
record
But
now
he's
fucked
the
game
up
'cause
one
of
the
ways
I
came
up
Was
through
that
publication,
the
same
one
that
made
me
famous
Now
the
owner
of
it
has
got
a
grudge
against
me
for
nothin'?
Well,
fuck
it,
that
motherfucker
could
get
it
too,
fuck
him
then!
But
I'm
so
busy
bein'
pissed
off,
I
don't
stop
to
think
That
we
just
inherited
50's
beef
with
Murder
Inc.
And
he's
inherited
mine,
which
is
fine,
ain't
like
either
of
us
mind
But
we
still
have
soldiers
that's
on
the
front
line
Who's
willin'
to
die
for
us
as
soon
as
we
give
the
orders
Never
to
extort
us,
strictly
to
show
they
support
us
And
maybe
shout
'em
out
in
a
rap
or
up
in
a
chorus
To
show
'em
we
love
'em
back
and
let
'em
know
how
important
it
is
To
have
Runyon
Avenue
soldiers
up
in
our
corners
Their
loyalty
to
us
is
worth
more
than
any
award
is
But
I
ain't
tryna
have
none
of
my
people
hurt
or
murdered
It
ain't
worth
it,
I
can't
think
of
a
perfecter
way
to
word
it
Than
to
just
say
that
I
love
y'all
too
much
to
see
the
verdict
I'll
walk
away
from
it
all
'fore
I
let
it
go
any
further
But
don't
get
it
twisted,
it's
not
a
plea
that
I'm
coppin'
I'm
just
willin'
to
be
the
bigger
man,
if
y'all
can
quit
poppin'
Off
at
the
jaws,
well,
then
I
can,
‘cause
frankly
I'm
sick
of
talkin'
I'm
not
gonna
let
someone
else's
coffin
rest
on
my
conscience
‘cause—
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left,
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win,
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
May
I
have
your
attention,
please?
May
I
have
your
attention,
please?
Will
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
I
repeat,
will
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
We're
gonna
have
a
problem
here...
Y'all
act
like
you
never
seen
a
white
person
before
Jaws
all
on
the
floor
like
Pam
like
Tommy
just
burst
in
the
door
And
started
whoopin'
her
ass
worse
than
before
They
first
were
divorced,
suin'
her
over
furniture
(Agh!)
It's
the
return
of
the
"Ah,
wait,
no
way,
you're
kidding
He
didn't
just
say
what
I
think
he
did,
did
he?"
And
Dr.
Dre
said…
nothing,
you
idiots!
Dr.
Dre's
dead,
he's
locked
in
my
basement
(ha
ha!)
Feminist
women
love
Eminem
"Chicka,
chicka,
chicka,
Slim
Shady,
I'm
sick
of
him
Look
at
him,
walkin'
around,
grabbin'
his
you-know-what
Flippin'
the
you-know-who,"
"Yeah,
but
he's
so
cute
though."
Yeah,
I
probably
got
a
couple
of
screws
up
in
my
head
loose
But
no
worse
than
what's
goin'
on
in
your
parents'
bedrooms
Sometimes
I
wanna
get
on
TV
and
just
let
loose
But
can't,
but
it's
cool
for
Tom
Green
to
hump
a
dead
moose
"My
bum
is
on
your
lips,
my
bum
is
on
your
lips"
And
if
I'm
lucky,
you
might
just
give
it
a
little
kiss
And
that's
the
message
that
we
deliver
to
little
kids
And
expect
them
not
to
know
what
a
woman's
clitoris
is
Of
course,
they're
gonna
know
what
intercourse
is
By
the
time
they
hit
fourth
grade
They've
got
the
Discovery
Channel,
don't
they?
We
ain't
nothin'
but
mammals—well,
some
of
us,
cannibals
Who
cut
other
people
open
like
cantaloupes
But
if
we
can
hump
dead
animals
and
antelopes
Then
there's
no
reason
that
a
man
and
another
man
can't
elope
But
if
you
feel
like
I
feel,
I
got
the
antidote
Women,
wave
your
pantyhose,
sing
the
chorus,
and
it
goes—
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up?
'Cause
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up?
Will
Smith
don't
gotta
cuss
in
his
raps
to
sell
records
(Nope)
Well,
I
do,
so
fuck
him
and
fuck
you
too!
You
think
I
give
a
damn
about
a
Grammy?
Half
of
you
critics
can't
even
stomach
me,
let
alone
stand
me
"But
Slim,
what
if
you
win,
wouldn't
it
be
weird?"
Why,
so
you
guys
could
just
lie
to
get
me
here?
So
you
can
sit
me
here
next
to
Britney
Spears?
Shit,
Christina
Aguilera
better
switch
me
chairs
So
I
can
sit
next
to
Carson
Daly
and
Fred
Durst
And
hear
'em
argue
over
who
she
gave
head
to
first
Little
bitch
put
me
on
blast
on
MTV
"Yeah,
he's
cute,
but
I
think
he's
married
to
Kim,
hee-hee."
I
should
download
her
audio
on
MP3
And
show
the
whole
world
how
you
gave
Eminem
VD
(Agh!)
I'm
sick
of
you
little
girl
and
boy
groups
All
you
do
is
annoy
me,
so
I
have
been
sent
here
to
destroy
you
And
there's
a
million
of
us
just
like
me
Who
cuss
like
me,
who
just
don't
give
a
fuck
like
me
Who
dress
like
me;
walk,
talk
and
act
like
me
And
just
might
be
the
next
best
thing,
but
not
quite
me
'Cause
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up?
'Cause
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are

So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up?
I'm
like
a
head
trip
to
listen
to,
‘cause
I'm
only
givin'
you
Things
you
joke
about
with
your
friends
inside
your
livin'
room
The
only
difference
is
I
got
the
balls
to
say
it
in
front
of
y'all
And
I
don't
gotta
be
false
or
sugarcoat
it
at
all
I
just
get
on
the
mic
and
spit
it
And
whether
you
like
to
admit
it,
I
just
shit
it
Better
than
90%
of
you
rappers
out
can
Then
you
wonder:
"How
can
Kids
eat
up
these
albums
like
Valiums?"
It's
funny,
‘cause
at
the
rate,
I'm
going,
when
I'm
30
I'll
be
the
only
person
in
the
nursing
home
flirting
Pinching
nurse's
asses
when
I'm
jacking
off
with
Jergens
And
I'm
jerking,
but
this
whole
bag
of
Viagra
isn't
working
And
every
single
person
is
a
Slim
Shady
lurking
He
could
be
working
at
Burger
King,
spittin'
on
your
onion
rings
Or
in
the
parking
lot,
circling,
screaming,
"I
don't
give
a
fuck!"
With
his
windows
down
and
his
system
up
So
will
the
real
Shady
please
stand
up
And
put
one
of
those
fingers
on
each
hand
up?
And
be
proud
to
be
outta
your
mind
and
outta
control
And
one
more
time,
loud
as
you
can,
how
does
it
go?
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up?
'Cause
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up?
'Cause
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up?
'Cause
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up?
Ha
ha,
I
guess
there’s
a
Slim
Shady
in
all
of
us
Fuck
it,
let’s
all
stand
up!
Yeah,
I
know
sometimes
things
may
not
always
make
sense
to
you
right
now.
But
hey,
what'd
Daddy
always
tell
you?
Straighten
up,
little
soldier,
stiffen
up
that
upper
lip!
What
you
cryin'
about?
You
got
me
Hailie,
I
know
you
miss
your
mom,
and
I
know
you
miss
your
dad
When
I'm
gone,
but
I'm
tryin'
to
give
you
the
life
that
I
never
had
I
can
see
you're
sad,
even
when
you
smile,
even
when
you
laugh
I
can
see
it
in
your
eyes,
deep
inside
you
wanna
cry
'Cause
you're
scared,
I
ain't
there
Daddy's
with
you
in
your
prayers
No
more
cryin',
wipe
them
tears
Daddy's
here,
no
more
nightmares
We
gon'
pull
together
through
it
We
gon'
do
it,
Lainie—Uncle's
crazy,
ain't
he?
Yeah,
but
he
loves
you,
girl,
and
you
better
know
it
We're
all
we
got
in
this
world,
when
it
spins,
when
it
swirls
When
it
whirls,
when
it
twirls,
two
little
beautiful
girls
Lookin'
puzzled,
in
a
daze,
I
know
it's
confusin'
you
Daddy's
always
on
the
move,
Momma's
always
on
the
news
I
try
to
keep
you
sheltered
from
it,
but
somehow
it
seems
The
harder
that
I
try
to
do
that,
the
more
it
backfires
on
me
All
the
things
growin'
up
as
Daddy
that
he
had
to
see
Daddy
don't
want
you
to
see,
but
you
see
just
as
much
as
he
did
We
did
not
plan
it
to
be
this
way,
your
mother
and
me
But
things
have
got
so
bad
between
us,
I
don't
see
us
ever
bein'
Together
ever
again,
like
we
used
to
be
when
we
was
teenagers
But
then,
of
course,
everything
always
happens
for
a
reason
I
guess
it
was
never
meant
to
be,
but
it's
just
something
We
have
no
control
over,
and
that's
what
destiny
is
But
no
more
worries,
rest
your
head
and
go
to
sleep
Maybe
one
day
we'll
wake
up
and
this'll
all
just
be
a
dream
Now
hush,
little
baby,
don't
you
cry
Everything's
gonna
be
alright
Stiffen
that
upper
lip
up,
little
lady,
I
told
ya
Daddy's
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
I
know
Mommy's
not
here
right
now,
and
we
don't
know
why
We
fear
how
we
feel
inside
It
may
seem
a
little
crazy,
pretty
baby
But
I
promise,
Momma's
gon'
be
alright
(heh)
It's
funny,
I
remember
back
one
year
when
Daddy
had
no
money
Mommy
wrapped
the
Christmas
presents
up
and
stuck
'em
under
the
tree
And
said
some
of
'em
were
from
me
'cause
Daddy
couldn't
buy
'em
I'll
never
forget
that
Christmas,
I
sat
up
the
whole
night
cryin'
'Cause
Daddy
felt
like
a
bum—see,
Daddy
had
a
job
But
his
job
was
to
keep
the
food
on
the
table
for
you
and
Mom
And
at
the
time,
every
house
that
we
lived
in
Either
kept
gettin'
broken
into
and
robbed
or
shot
up
on
the
block
And
your
mom
was
savin'
money
for
you
in
a
jar
Tryin'
to
start
a
piggy
bank
for
you
so
you
could
go
to
college
Almost
had
a
thousand
dollars,
'til
someone
broke
in
and
stole
it
And
I
know
it
hurt
so
bad
it
broke
your
momma's
heart
And
it
seemed
like
everything
was
just
startin'
to
fall
apart
Mom
and
Dad
was
arguin'
a
lot,
so
Momma
moved
back
On
to
Chalmers
in
the
flat,
one
bedroom
apartment
And
Dad
moved
back
to
the
other
side
of
8
Mile
on
Novara
And
that's
when
Daddy
went
to
California
with
his
CD
And
met
Dr.
Dre
and
flew
you
and
Momma
out
to
see
me
But
Daddy
had
to
work,
you
and
Momma
had
to
leave
me
Then
you
started
seein'
Daddy
on
the
TV,
and
Momma
didn't
like
it
And
you
and
Lainie
were
too
young
to
understand
it
Papa
was
a
rolling
stone,
Momma
developed
a
habit
And
it
all
happened
too
fast
for
either
one
of
us
to
grab
it
I'm
just
sorry
you
were
there
and
had
to
witness
it
first
hand
'Cause
all
I
ever
wanted
to
do
was
just
make
you
proud
Now
I'm
sittin'
in
this
empty
house
Just
reminiscin',
lookin'
at
your
baby
pictures,
it
just
trips
me
out
To
see
how
much
you
both
have
grown,
it's
almost
like
you're
sisters
now
Wow,
guess
you
pretty
much
are,
and
Daddy's
still
here
Lainie,
I'm
talkin'
to
you
too,
Daddy's
still
here
I
like
the
sound
of
that,
yeah,
it's
got
a
ring
to
it,
don't
it?
Sshh!
Momma's
only
gone
for
the
moment
Now
hush,
little
baby,
don't
you
cry
Everything's
gonna
be
alright
Stiffen
that
upper
lip
up,
little
lady,
I
told
ya
Daddy's
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
I
know
Mommy's
not
here
right
now,
and
we
don't
know
why
We
fear
how
we
feel
inside
It
may
seem
a
little
crazy,
pretty
baby
But
I
promise,
Momma's
gon'
be
alright
And
if
you
ask
me
to,
Daddy's
gonna
buy
you
a
mockingbird
I'ma
give
you
the
world
I'ma
buy
a
diamond
ring
for
you,
I'ma
sing
for
you
I'll
do
anything
for
you
to
see
you
smile
And
if
that
mockingbird
don't
sing
and
that
ring
don't
shine
I'ma
break
that
birdie's
neck
I'll
go
back
to
the
jeweler
who
sold
it
to
ya
And
make
him
eat
every
carat,
don't
fuck
with
Dad!
(Ha-ha!)
Meet
Eddie,
23
years
old
Fed
up
with
life
and
the
way
things
are
going
(Damn,
I'm
going
fucking
insane)
He
decides
to
rob
a
liquor
store
(I
gotta
take
this
shit,
I
can't
take
it
no
more,
holmes)
But
on
his
way
in,
he
has
a
sudden
change
of
heart
(Shit
is
mine)
And
suddenly
(I
gotta
do
this)
His
conscience
comes
into
play
(I
gotta
do
this)
Alright,
stop
(Huh?)
Now
before
you
walk
in
the
door
of
this
liquor
store
And
try
to
get
money
out
the
drawer
You
better
think
of
the
consequence
(Who
are
you?)
I'm
your
motherfuckin'
conscience
That's
nonsense
Go
in,
gaffle
the
money,
and
run
to
one
of
your
aunt's
cribs
And
borrow
a
damn
dress
and
one
of
her
blond
wigs
(Can
I
borrow
this?)
Tell
her
you
need
a
place
to
stay,
you'll
be
safe
for
days
If
you
shave
your
legs
with
Renee's
razor
blades
Yeah,
but
if
it
all
goes
through
like
it's
supposed
to
The
whole
neighborhood
knows
you
and
they'll
expose
you
Think
about
it
before
you
walk
in
the
door
first
Look
at
the
store
clerk,
she's
older
than
George
Burns
Fuck
that,
do
that
shit,
shoot
that
bitch
Can
you
afford
to
blow
this
shit?
Are
you
that
rich?
Why
you
give
a
fuck
if
she
dies?
Are
you
that
bitch?
Do
you
really
think
she
gives
a
fuck
if
you
have
kids?
Man,
don't
do
it,
it's
not
worth
it
to
risk
it
(You're
right)
Not
over
this
shit
(Stop)
Drop
the
biscuit
(I
will)
Don't
even
listen
to
Slim,
yo,
he's
bad
for
you
You
know
what,
Dre?
I
don't
like
your
attitude
Come
on,
just
come
in
here
for
a
minute
I
don't
know
Look,
look,
look
Damn
Look,
it's
gonna
be
alright,
alright?
O-okay
Look,
give
me
a
kiss,
pull
your
pants
off,
come
on
Meet
Stan,
21
years
old
After
meeting
a
young
girl
at
a
rave
party
Things
start
getting
hot
and
heavy
in
an
upstairs
bedroom
Once
again,
his
conscience
comes
into
play
Now,
listen
to
me,
while
you're
kissin'
her
cheek
And

Now

is
nibble
on
this
little
bitch's
earlobe
Yo,

girl's
only
fifteen
years
old
You
shouldn't
take
advantage
of
her,
it's
not
fair
Yo,
look
at
her
bush,
does

got
hair?
(Uh-huh)
Fuck

bitch
right
here
on
the
spot,
bare
'Til
she
passes
out
and
she
forgot
how

there
Man,

home)
Meet

29-year-old
construction
worker
After
coming
home
from
a
hard
day's
work
He
walks
in
the
door
of
his
trailer
park
home
To
find
his
wife
in
bed
with
another
man
(What

Grady
Alright,

Fuck

While

Fuck

Wait,

this
shit?
What,
she
tripped,
fell,
landed
on
his
dick?
Tsh,

Shady,

Grady
But

about
the
baby
before

Okay,

Still

Grab

That's

You

Didn't

There

Have

Picket
signs

Sick

All

Tempers

parents,
just
blow
'em
off
and
keep
goin'
Not
takin'
nothin'
from
no
one,
give
'em
hell
long
as
I'm
breathin'
Keep
kickin'
ass
in
the
morning
and
takin'
names
in
the
evenin'
Leave
'em
with
a
taste
as
sour
as
vinegar
in
they
mouth
See,
they
can
trigger
me,
but
they'll
never
figure
me
out
Look
at
me
now!
I
bet
you're
prob'ly
sick
of
me
now
Ain't
you,
Mama?
I'ma
make
you
look
so
ridiculous
now!
I'm
sorry,
Mama
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you
I
never
meant
to
make
you
cry
But
tonight
I'm
cleanin'
out
my
closet
(One
more
time!)
I
said
I'm
sorry,
Mama
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you
I
never
meant
to
make
you
cry
But
tonight
I'm
cleanin'
out
my
closet
(Ha!)
I
got
some
skeletons
in
my
closet
And
I
don't
know
if
no
one
knows
it
So
before
they
throw
me
inside
my
coffin
and
close
it
I'ma
expose
it;
I'll
take
you
back
to
'73
Before
I
ever
had
a
multi-platinum-selling
CD
I
was
a
baby,
maybe
I
was
just
a
couple
of
months
My
faggot
father
must've
had
his
panties
up
in
a
bunch
‘Cause
he
split,
I
wonder
if
he
even
kissed
me
goodbye
No,
I
don't,
on
second
thought,
I
just
fuckin'
wished
he
would
die
I
look
at
Hailie,
and
I
couldn't
picture
leavin'
her
side
Even
if
I
hated
Kim,
I'd
grit
my
teeth
and
I'd
try
To
make
it
work
with
her
at
least
for
Hailie's
sake
I
maybe
made
some
mistakes
But
I'm
only
human,
but
I'm
man
enough
to
face
'em
today
What
I
did
was
stupid,
no
doubt
it
was
dumb
But
the
smartest
shit
I
did
was
take
the
bullets
out
of
that
gun
‘Cause
I'da
killed
'em,
shit,
I
woulda
shot
Kim
and
him
both
It's
my
life,
I'd
like
to
welcome
y'all
to
The
Eminem
Show
I'm
sorry,
Mama
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you
I
never
meant
to
make
you
cry
But
tonight
I'm
cleanin'
out
my
closet
(One
more
time!)
I
said
I'm
sorry,
Mama
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you
I
never
meant
to
make
you
cry
But
tonight
I'm
cleanin'
out
my
closet
(Uh)
Now,
I
would
never
diss
my
own
mama
just
to
get
recognition
Take
a
second
to
listen
'fore
you
think
this
record
is
dissin'
But
put
yourself
in
my
position,
just
try
to
envision
Witnessin'
your
mama
poppin'
prescription
pills
in
the
kitchen
Bitchin'
that
someone's
always
goin'
through
her
purse
and
shit's
missin'
Goin'
through
public
housing
systems
Victim
of
Münchausen's
Syndrome
My
whole
life
I
was
made
to
believe
I
was
sick
when
I
wasn't
'Til
I
grew
up,
now
I
blew
up
It
makes
you
sick
to
your
stomach,
doesn't
it?
Wasn't
it
the
reason
you
made
that
CD
for
me,
Ma?
So
you
could
try
to
justify
the
way
you
treated
me,
Ma?
But
guess
what,
you're
gettin'
older
now
And
it's
cold
when
you're
lonely
And
Nathan's
growin'
up
so
quick
He's
gonna
know
that
you're
phony
And
Hailie's
gettin'
so
big
now,
you
should
see
her,
she's
beautiful
But
you'll
never
see
her—she
won't
even
be
at
your
funeral
(ha-ha!)
See,
what
hurts
me
the
most
is
you
won't
admit
you
was
wrong
Bitch,
do
your
song,
keep
tellin'
yourself
that
you
was
a
mom!
But
how
dare
you
try
to
take
what
you
didn't
help
me
to
get?!
You
selfish
bitch,
I
hope
you
fuckin'
burn
in
hell
for
this
shit!
Remember
when
Ronnie
died
and
you
said
you
wished
it
was
me?
Well,
guess
what,
I
am
dead—dead
to
you
as
can
be!
I'm
sorry,
Mama
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you
I
never
meant
to
make
you
cry
But
tonight
I'm
cleanin'
out
my
closet
(One
more
time!)
I
said
I'm
sorry,
Mama
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you
I
never
meant
to
make
you
cry
But
tonight
I'm
cleanin'
out
my
closet
Down,
down,
down
Down,
down,
down
Down,
down,
down
Down,
okay!
Guess
who's
back,
back
again
Shady's
back,
tell
a
friend
Now
everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
To
the
dance
floor,
to
the
dance
floor
Now
everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
Alright,
stop…
pajama
time!
Come
here,
little
kiddies!
On
my
lap!
Guess
who's
back
with
a
brand
new
rap?
And
I
don't
mean
"rap"
as
in
a
new
case
Of
child
molestation
accusations
Ah,
ah,
ah,
ah,
ah,
no
worries
Papa's
got
a
brand
new
bag
of
toys
What
else
could
I
possibly
do
to
make
noise?
I
done
touched
on
everything
but
little
boys
And
that's
not
a
stab
at
Michael
That's
just
a
metaphor,
I'm
just
psycho
I
go
a
little
bit
crazy
sometimes
I
get
a
little
bit
out
of
control
with
my
rhymes
Good
God,
dip,
do
a
little
slide
Bend
down,
touch
your
toes,
and
just
glide
Up
the
center
of
the
dance
floor
Like
TP
for
my
bung-hole
And
it's
cool
if
you
let
one
go
Nobody's
gonna
know;
who'd
hear
it?
Give
a
little
"poot
poot,"
it's
okay
(*fart*)
Oops,
my
CD
just
skipped
And
everyone
just
heard
you
let
one
rip
Now,
I'm
gonna
make
you
dance
It's
your
chance,
yeah
boy,
shake
that
ass
Whoops,
I
mean
girl…
girl,
girl,
girl
Girl,
you
know
you're
my
world
Alright,

lose
it!
(Ah,

Just
lose
it!
(Ah,

Go

(Ah,

Oh,

(Ah,

oh,

baby
(Ah,

Well,
it's
Friday
and
it's
my
day
Just
to
party
all
the
way
'til
Sunday
Maybe
'til
Monday,
I
don't
know
what
day
Every
day's
just
a
holiday
Cruisin'
on
the
freeway,
feelin'
kinda
breezy
Let
the
top
down
and
my
hair
blow
I
don't
know
where
I'm
goin',
all
I
know
is
When
I
get
there
someone's
gonna
touch
my
body
'Scuse
me,
miss,
I
don't
mean
to
sound
like
a
jerk
But
I'm
feelin'
just
a
little
stressed
out
from
work
Could
you
punch
me
in
the
stomach
and
pull
my
hair
Spit
on
me,
maybe
gouge
my
eyes
out?
(Yeah)
Now,
what's
your
name,
girl?
What's
your
sign?
Man,
you
must
be
up
out
your
mind!
Dre
(ah,
aA),
be-!e,r
goggles,
blind
I'm
just
tryin'
to
unwind,
now
I'm…
Now,
I'm
gonna
make
you
dance
It's
your
chance,
yeah
boy,
shake
that
ass
Whoops,
I
mean
girl…
girl,
girl,
girl
Girl,
you
know
you're
my
world
Alright,
now
lose
it!
(Ah,
ah,
ah,
ah,
ah!)
Just
lose
it!
(Ah,
ah,
ah,
ah,
ah!)
Go
crazy!
(Ah,
ah,
ah,
ah,
ah!)
Oh,
baby
(Ah,
ah-!)
oh,
baby,
baby
(Ah,
ah-!)
Well,
it's
Tuesday
and
I'm
locked
up
I'm
in
jail
and
I
don't
know
what
happened
They
say
I
was
runnin'
butt-naked
Down
the
street
screamin',
(Ah,
ah,
ah,
ah!)
Your
honor,
I'm
sorry,
I
don't
remember
All
I
know
is
this
much,
I'm
not
guilty
They
said,
"Save
it,
boy,
we
got
you
on
tape
Yellin'
at
an
old
lady
to
touch
my
body!"
Now
this
is
the
part
where
the
rap
breaks
down
It
gets
real
intense,
no
one
makes
a
sound
Everything
looks
like
it's
8
Mile
now
The
beat
comes
back,
and
everybody
lose
themselves
Now
snap
back
to
reality;
look,
it's
B.
Rabbit!
"Yo,
you
signed
me
up
to
battle?
I'm
a
grown
man!"
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I
don't
have
any
lines
to
go
right
here,
so
chubba
Teletubby
Fellas!
(What?)
Fellas!
(What?)
Grab
your
left
nut,
make
your
right
one
jealous
(what?)
Black
girls,
white
girls,
skinny
girls,
fat
girls
Tall
girls,
small
girls,
I'm
calling
all
girls
Everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
It's
your
chance
for
a
little
romance
or
Butt-squeezin',
it's
the
season
Just
go,
(Ah,
ah,
ah,
ah-!);
it's
so
appeasin'
Now,
I'm
gonna
make
you
dance
It's
your
chance,
yeah
boy,
shake
that
ass
Whoops,
I
mean
girl…
girl,
girl,
girl
Girl,
you
know
you're
my
world
Alright,
now
lose
it!
(Ah,
ah,
ah,
ah,
ah!)
Just
lose
it!
(Ah,
ah,
ah,
ah,

Go

(Ah,
ah,
ah,
ah,
ah!)
Oh,
baby
(Ah,
ah!)
oh,
baby,
baby
(Ah,

Touch
my
body
Touch
my
body
Oh
boy,
touch
my
body
I
mean
girl,
touch
my
body
Yeah,
it's
my
life
In
my
own
words,
I
guess
Have
you
ever
loved
someone
so
much,
you'd
give
an
arm
for?
Not
the
expression,
no,
literally
give
an
arm
for
When
they
know
they're
your
heart
and
you
know
you
are
their
armor
And
you
will
destroy
anyone
who
would
try
to
harm
her
But
what
happens
when
karma
turns
right
around
to
bite
you?
And
everything
you
stand
for
turns
on
you
to
spite
you?
What
happens
when
you
become
the
main
source
of
her
pain?
"Daddy,
look
what
I
made!"
"Dad's
gotta
go
catch
a
plane"
"Daddy,
where's
Mommy?
I
can't
find
Mommy,
where
is
she?"
"I
don't
know,
go
play,
Hailie,
baby,
your
daddy's
busy
Daddy's
writin'
a
song,
this
song
ain't
gon'
write
itself
I'll
give
you
one
underdog,
then
you
gotta
swing
by
yourself"
Then
turn
right
around
on
that
song
and
tell
her
you
love
her
And
put
hands
on
her
mother
who's
a
spitting
image
of
her
That's
Slim
Shady,
yeah,
baby,
Slim
Shady's
crazy
Shady
made
me,
but
tonight
Shady's
rock-a-bye
baby
And
when
I'm
gone,
just
carry
on,
don't
mourn,
rejoice
Every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
and
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
So,
baby,
don't
feel
my
pain,
just
smile
back
And
when
I'm
gone,
just
carry
on,
don't
mourn,
rejoice
Every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
and
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
So,
baby,
don't
feel
my
pain,
just
smile
back
I
keep
havin'
this
dream,
I'm
pushin'
Hailie
on
the
swing
She
keeps
screamin'
she
don't
want
me
to
sing
"You're
makin'
Mommy
cry,
why?
Why
is
Mommy
cryin'?"
"Baby,
Daddy
ain't
leavin'
no
more"
"Daddy,
you're
lyin'!
You
always
say
that,
you
always
say
this
is
the
last
time
But
you
ain't
leavin'
no
more,
Daddy,
you're
mine!"
She's
pilin'
boxes
in
front
of
the
door,
tryna
block
it
"Daddy,
please!
Daddy,
don't
leave!
Daddy,
no,
stop
it!"
Goes
in
her
pocket,
pulls
out
a
tiny
necklace
locket
It's
got
a
picture,
"This'll
keep
you
safe,
Daddy,
take
it
with
ya!"
I
look
up,
it's
just
me
standin'
in
the
mirror
These
fuckin'
walls
must
be
talkin',
'cause
man,
I
can
hear
'em
They're
sayin',
"You
got
one
more
chance
to
do
right
and
it's
tonight
Now
go
out
there
and
show
'em
that
you
love
'em
'fore
it's
too
late!"
And
just
as
I
go
to
walk
out
of
my
bedroom
door
It
turns
to
a
stage,
they're
gone
and
this
spotlight
is
on
and
I'm
singin'
And
when
I'm
gone,
just
carry
on,
don't
mourn,
rejoice
Every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
and
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
So,
baby,
don't
feel
my
pain,
just
smile
back
And
when
I'm
gone,
just
carry
on,
don't
mourn,
rejoice
Every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just

that
I'm

down
on
you

and
I
didn't

So,

smile
back
Sixty-thousand
people
all
jumpin'
out
their
seat
The
curtain
closes,
they're
throwin'
roses
at
my
feet
I
take
a
bow,
and
thank
you
all
for
comin'
out
They're
screamin'
so
loud,
I
take
one
last
look
at
the
crowd
I
glance
down,
I
don't
believe
what
I'm
seein'
"Daddy,
it's
me!
Help
Mommy,
her
wrists
are
bleedin'!"
But
baby,
we're
in
Sweden,
how
did
you
get
to
Sweden?
"I
followed
you,
Daddy,
you
told
me
that
you
weren't
leavin'
You
lied
to
me,
Dad,
and
now
you
made
Mommy
sad
And
I
bought
you
this
coin,
it
says
'Number
One
Dad'
That's
all
I
wanted,
I
just
wanna
give
you
this
coin
I
get
the
point,
fine,
me
and
Mommy
are
goin'."
But
baby,
wait!
–
"It's
too
late,
Dad,
you
made
the
choice
Now
go
up
there
and
show
'em
that
you
love
'em
more
than
us
That's
what
they
want,
they
want
you,
Marshall,
they
keep
Screamin'
your
name,
it's
no
wonder
you
can't
go
to
sleep
Just
take
another
pill,
yeah,
I
bet
you
you
will
You
rap
about
it,
yeah,
word,
k-keep
it
real."
I
hear
applause,
all
this
time
I
couldn't
see
How
could
it
be
that
the
curtain
is
closin'
on
me?
I
turn
around,
find
a
gun
on
the
ground,
cock
it
Put
it
to
my
brain,
scream,
"Die,
Shady!"
and
pop
it
The
sky
darkens,
my
life
flashes,
the
plane
that
I
was
Supposed
to
be
on
crashes
and
burns
to
ashes
That's
when
I
wake
up,
alarm
clock's
ringin',
there's
birds
singin'
It's
spring
and
Hailie's
outside
swingin'
I
walk
right
up
to
Kim
and
kiss
her,
tell
her
I
miss
her
Hailie
just
smiles,
and
winks
at
her
little
sister,
almost
as
if
to
say
And
when
I'm
gone,
just
carry
on,
don't
mourn,
rejoice
Every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
and
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
So,
baby,
don't
feel
my
pain,
just
smile
back
And
when
I'm
gone,
just
carry
on,
don't
mourn,
rejoice
Every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
and
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
So,
baby,
don't
feel
my
pain,
just
smile
back
*Curtains

Dear
Slim,
I
wrote
you,
but
you
still
ain't
callin'
I
left
my
cell,
my
pager
and
my
home
phone
at
the
bottom
I
sent
two
letters
back
in
autumn
You
must
not've
got
'em
There
probably
was
a
problem
at
the
post
office
or
somethin'
Sometimes
I
scribble
addresses
too
sloppy
when
I
jot
'em
But
anyways,
f—
it,
what's
been
up,
man?
How's
your
daughter?
My
girlfriend's
pregnant
too,
I'm
'bout
to
be
a
father
If
I
have
a
daughter,
guess
what
I'ma
call
her?
I'ma
name
her
Bonnie
I
read
about
your
Uncle
Ronnie
too,
I'm
sorry
I
know
you
probably
hear
this
every
day
But
I'm
your
biggest
fan
I
even
got
the
underground
stuff
that
you
did
with
Skam
I
got
a
room
full
of
your
posters
and
your
pictures,
man
Anyways,
I
hope
you
get
this,
man,
hit
me
back
Just
to
chat,
truly
yours,
your
biggest
fan,
this
is
Stan
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
And
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'd
all
be
gray
But
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's
not
so
bad
Dear
Slim,
you
still
ain't
called
or
wrote
I
hope
you
have
a
chance
I
ain't
mad,
I
just
think
it's
messed
up
you
don't
answer
fans
If
you
didn't
want
to
talk
to
me
outside
the
concert
You
didn't
have
to
But
you
could've
signed
an
autograph
for
Matthew
That's
my
little
brother,
man,
he's
only
six
years
old
We
waited
in
the
blisterin'
cold
for
you
For
four
hours,
and
you
just
said
no
That's
pretty
crummy,
man,
you're
like
his
favorite
idol
He
wants
to
be
just
like
you,
man,
he
likes
you
more
than
I
do
I
ain't
that
mad
though,
I
just
don't
like
being
lied
to
Remember
when
we
met
in
Denver?
You
said
if
I'd
write
you,
you
would
write
back
See,
I'm
just
like
you
in
a
way;
I
never
knew
my
father
neither
He
used
to
always
cheat
on
my
mom
and
beat
her
I
can
relate
to
what
you're
sayin'
in
your
songs
So
when
I
have
a
crumby
day,
I
drift
away
and
put
'em
on
I
even
got
a
tattoo
of
your
name
across
the
chest
Sometimes
I
even
cut
myself
to
see
how
much
it
bleeds
It's
like
adrenaline,
the
pain
is
such
a
sudden
rush
for
me
See,
everything
you
say
is
real
And
I
respect
you
‘cause
you
tell
it
My
girlfriend's
jealous
‘cause
I
talk
about
you
24/7
But
she
don't
know
you
like
I
know
you,
Slim,
no
one
does
She
don't
know
what
it
was
like
for
people
like
us
growin'
up
You
gotta
call
me,
man
I'll
be
the
biggest
fan
you'll
ever
lose,
sincerely
yours,
Stan
P.S.
We
should
be
together
too
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
And
I
can't
see
at

And
even
if
I
could
it'd
all
be
gray
But
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not

it's
not
so

Dear
Mr.
I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll
be
the
last
package
I
ever
send
your
ass
It's
been
six
months,
and
still
no
word—I
don't
deserve
it?
I
know
you
got
my
last
two
letters
I
wrote
the
addresses
on
'em
perfect
So
this
is
my
cassette
I'm
sendin'
you,
I
hope
you
hear
it
I'm
in
the
car
right
now,
I'm
doin'
90
on
the
freeway
Hey,
Slim,
I
drank
a
fifth
of
vodka,
you
dare
me
to
drive?
You
know
the
song
by
Phil
Collins
"In
the
Air
of
the
Night,"
about
that
guy
who
could've
saved
that
other
guy
from
drownin'
But
didn't,
then
Phil
saw
it
all,
then
at
a
show
he
found
him?
That's
kinda
how
this
is
You
could've
rescued
me
from
drownin'
Now
it's
too
late,
I'm
on
a
thousand
downers
now,
I'm
drowsy
And
all
I
wanted
was
a
lousy
letter
or
a
call
I
hope
you
know
I
ripped
all
of
your
pictures
off
the
wall
I
loved
you,
Slim,
we
could've
been
together
Think
about
it!
You
ruined
it
now
I
hope
you
go
to
sleep
and
you
dream
about
it
And
when
you
dream
I
hope
you
can't
sleep
And
you
scream
about
it;
I
hope
your
conscience
eats
at
you
And
you
can't
breathe
without
me
Hey,
Slim,
that's
my
girlfriend
screamin'
in
the
trunk
But
I
didn't
slit
her
throat,
I
just
tied
her
up,
see,
I
ain't
like
you
‘Cause
if
she
suffocates
she'll
suffer
more
And
then
she'll
die
too
Well,
gotta
go,
I'm
almost
at
the
bridge
now
Oh
shoot,
I
forgot,
how
am
I
supposed
to
send
this
tape
out?!
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
And
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'd
all
be
gray
But
your
picture

my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not

bad,
it's
not
so

Dear
Stan,
I
meant
to
write
you
sooner,
but
I
just
been
busy
You
said
your
girlfriend's
pregnant
now—how
far
along
is
she?
Look,
I'm
really
flattered
you
would
call
your
daughter
that
And
here's
an
autograph
For
your
brother,
I
wrote
it
on
a
Starter
cap
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
see
you
at
the
show,
I
must've
missed
you
But
what's
this
stuff
you
said
about
you
like
to
cut
your
wrists
too?
I
say
that
stuff
just
clownin'
Dawg,
come
on,
how
messed
up
is
you?
You
got
some
issues,
Stan,
I
think
you
need
some
counselin'
To
help
your
ass
from
bouncin'
Off
the
walls
when
you
get
down
some
And
what's
this
junk
about
us
meant
to
be
together?
That
type
of
crap'll
make
me
not
want
us
to
meet
each
other
I
really
think
you
and
your
girlfriend
need
each
other
Or
maybe
you
just
need
to
treat
her
better
I
hope
you
get
to
read
this
letter
I
just
hope
it
reaches
you
in
time
Before
you
hurt
yourself,
I
think
that
you'll
be
doin'
just
fine
If
you
relax
a
little,
I'm
glad
I
inspire
you
But
Stan,
why
are
you
so
mad?
Try
to
understand
that
I
do
want
you
as
a
fan
A
couple
weeks
ago
that
made
me
sick
Some
dude
was
drunk
and
drove
his
car
over
a
bridge
And
had
his
girlfriend
in
the
trunk
And
she
was
pregnant
with
his
kid
And
in
the
car
they
found
a
tape
But
they
didn't
say
who
it
was
to
Come
to
think
about
it,
his
name
was…
it
was
you,
damn
Bad
Boy,
baby
Yeah,
yeah
Junior
M.A.F.I.A.,
yeah
B.I.G.
2000,
B.I.G.
2000
again
Yeah
The
weak
or
the
strong
Who
got
it
going
on?
You're
dead
wrong
The
weak
or
the
strong
Who
got
it
going
on?
You're
dead
wrong
Relax
and
take
notes
(ah!)
While
I

tokes
of
the
marijuana
smoke
Throw

Motherfucker,

"Hail

smack
the

Take
her
Gucci
bag
and

North
Face

her
back
Jab

Oh,

Cu-macho
I

(Uh)
I

with
the
Stylistics
"Make

niggas
need

Smell

Then

Her

Sucking

And

I
guess
I
was
a
combination
of
House
of
Pain
and
Bobby
Brown
I
was
humpin'
around
and
jumpin'
around
Jacked
her,
then,
I
asked
her,
"Who's
the
man?"
(Mmm)
She
said,
"B-I-G,"
then
I
bust
in
her
E-Y-E
(Yo,
Big,
you're
dead
wrong!)
The
weak
or
the
strong
Who
got
it
going
on?
You're
dead

Yo
Big,

The

You're

When
I
get
dusted,
I
like
to
spread
the
blood
like

Trust

Move

I'm

unh
Leave

Because

Okay,
I'm
going
to
attempt
to
drown
myself
You

You

Mic

I'm

so
when
I

If
you

back
with
a
battle
rap
you
wrote
for
Canibus
I'll
strangle
you
to
death,
then
I'll
choke
you
again
And
break
your
fuckin'
legs
'til
your
bones
poke
through
your
skin
You
beef
with
me,
I'ma
even
the
score
equally
Take
you
on
Jerry
Springer
and
beat
your
ass
legally
I
get
too
blunted
off
of
funny
home
grown
'Cause
when
I
smoke
out,
I
hit
the
trees
harder
than
Sonny
Bono
(Oh
no)
So
if
I
said
I
never
did
drugs
That
would
mean
I
lie
and
get
fucked
more
than
the
President
does
Hilary
Clinton
tried
to
slap
me
and
call
me
a
pervert
I
ripped
her
fuckin'
tonsils
out
and
fed
her
sherbet
(Bitch)
My
nerves
hurt,
and
lately
I'm
on
edge
Grabbed
Vanilla
Ice
and
ripped
out
(C'mere)
his
blond
dreads
(Fuck
you)
Every
girl
I
ever
went
out
with
has
gone
les'
Follow
me
and
do
exactly
what
the
song
says
Smoke
weed,
take
pills,
drop
out
of
school,
kill
people
And
drink,
jump
behind
the
wheel
like
it
was
still
legal
I'm
dumb
enough
to
walk
in
a
store
and
steal
So
I'm
dumb
enough
to
ask
for
a
date
with
Lauryn
Hill
Some
people
only
see
that
I'm
white,
ignorin'
skill
'Cause
I
stand
out
like
a
green
hat
with
a
orange
bill
But
I
don't
get
pissed,
y'all
don't
even
see
through
the
mist
How
the
fuck
can
I
be
white?
I
don't
even
exist
I
get
a
clean
shave,
bathe,
go
to
a
rave
Die
from
an
overdose
and
dig
myself
up
out
of
my
grave
My
middle
finger
won't
go
down,
how
do
I
wave?
And
this
is
how
I'm
supposed
to
teach
kids
how
to
behave?
Now,
follow
me
and
do
exactly
what
you
see
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me?
I
slap
women
and
eat
shrooms,
then
OD
Now,
don't
you
want
to
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me?
Me
and
Marcus
Allen
went
over
to
see
Nicole
When
we
heard
a
knock
at
the
door,
must've
been
Ron
Gold
Jumped
behind
the
door,
put
the
orgy
on
hold
Killed
them
both,
then
smeared
blood
on
the
white
Bronco
(We
did
it)
My
mind
won't
work
if
my
spine
don't
jerk
I
slapped
Garth
Brooks
out
of
his
rhinestone
shirt
I'm
not
a
player,
just
a
ill
rhyme
sayer
That'll
spray
a
aerosol
can
up
at
the

layer
My
rap
style's
warped,
I'm
runnin'
out
the
morgue
With
your
dead
grandmother's
corpse
to
throw
it
on
your
porch
Jumped
in
a
Chickenhawk
cartoon
with
a
cape
on
And
beat
up
Foghorn
Leghorn
with
an
acorn
I'm
'bout
as
normal
as
Norman
Bates
with
deformative
traits
A
premature
birth
that
was
four
minutes
late
Mother,
are
you
there?
I
love
you
I
never
meant
to
hit
you
over
the
head
with
that
shovel
(That
shovel)
Will
someone
please
explain
to
my
brain
That
I
just
severed
the
main
vein
with
a
chainsaw
and
I'm
in
pain?
I
take
a
breather
and
sigh,
either
I'm
high
or
I'm
nuts
'Cause
if
you
ain't
tiltin'
this
room,
neither
am
I
So
when
you
see
your
mom
with
a
thermometer
shoved
in
her
ass
Then
it
probably
is
obvious
I
got
it
on
with
her
'Cause
when
I
drop
this
solo
shit,
it's
over
with
I
bought
Cage's
tape,
opened
it,
and
dubbed
over
it
I
came
to
the
club
drunk
with
a
fake
ID
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me?
I've
been
with
ten
women
who
got
HIV
Now,
don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me?
I
got
genital
warts
and
it
burns
when
I
pee
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me?
I
tie
a
rope
around
my
penis
and
jump
from
a
tree
You
probably
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me
When
I
was
just
a
little
baby
boy
My
momma
used
to
tell
me
these
crazy
things
She
used
to
tell
me
my
daddy
was
an
evil
man
She
used
to
tell
me
he
hated
me
But
then
I
got
a
little
bit
older
And
I
realized
she
was
the
crazy
one
But
there
was
nothing
I
could
do
or
say
to
try
to
change
it
'Cause
that's
just
the
way
she
was
They
said
I
can't
rap
about
being
broke
no
more
They
ain't
say
I
can't
rap
about
coke
no
more
(Ahh)
Slut,
you
think
I
won't
choke
no
whore
'Til
them
vocal
cords
don't
work
in
her
throat
no
more?
(Ahh)
These
motherfuckers
are
thinkin'
I'm
playin'
Thinkin'
I'm
sayin'
this
shit
'cause
I'm
thinkin'
it
just
to
be
sayin'
it
(Ahh)
Put
your
hands
down,
bitch—I
ain't
gon'
shoot
you
I'ma
pull
you
to
this
bullet
and
put
it
through
you
(Ahh)
Shut

You're
causin'
too
much
chaos
Just
bend
over
and

it
like

Ma?
"Oh,

raping
his
own
mother
Abusing
a
whore,
snorting
coke
And

gave
him

Rolling
Stone

You're
goddamn

I'm

For

But

Bitches

'Cause

Got

Whoops!
Is

a

hint?
No,
just
criminal
intent
to
sodomize
women
again
Eminem
offend?
No,
Eminem'll
insult
And
if
you
ever
give
in
to
him,
you
give
him
an
impulse
To
do
it
again,
then
if
he
does
it
again
You'll
probably
end
up
jumpin'
out
of
somethin'
up
on

Bitch,

balls
got
larger
I
drank
more
liquor
to
fuck
you
up
quicker
Than
you'd
wanna
fuck
me
up
for
sayin'
the
word—
My
morals
went
*thhbbpp*
when
the
president
got
oral
Sex
in
his
Oval
Office
on
top
of
his
desk
off
of
his
own
employee
Now,
don't
ignore
me,
you
won't
avoid
me
You
can't
miss
me:
I'm
white,
blonde-haired,
and
my
nose
is
pointy
I'm
the
bad
guy
who
makes
fun
of
people
that
die
In
plane
crashes
and
laughs
as
long
as
it
ain't
happenin'
to
him
Slim
Shady,
I'm
as
crazy
as
Em-
-inem
and
Kim
combined
(The
maniac's
in)
In
place
of
the
Doctor
‘cause
Dre
couldn't
make
it
today
He's
a
little
under
the
weather,
so
I'm
takin'
his
place
(Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh,
that's
Dre
with
an
AK
to
his
face
Don't
make
me
kill
him
too
and
spray
his
brains
all
over
the
place
I
told
you,
Dre,
you
should've
kept
that
thang
put
away
I
guess
that'll
teach
you
not
to
let
me
play
with
it,
eh?
I'm
a
criminal!

Windows

So
when
I
rob
a

run
out

just
dive
in
it
So
I'll
be

This

lucky
I
didn't

If
I
ever

I'd
shave
my
nuts
Tuck
my
dick

my

cluck
You
motherfuckin'
chickens
ain't
brave
enough
To

I
say,
so
just
tape

Shit,
half
the

I
say,
I
just
make
it
up
To
make
you
mad,
so
kiss
my
white
naked
ass
And
if
it's
not
a

that
I
make

I'ma
be

Motherfuckers
say
that
I'm
foolish,
I
only
talk
about
jewels
(Bling
bling)
Do
you
fools
listen
to
music
or
do
you
just
skim
through
it?
See,
I'm
influenced
by
the
ghetto
you
ruined
The
same
dude
you
gave
nothin',
I
made
somethin'
doin'
What
I
do,
through
and
through
and
I
give
you
the
news
with
a
twist,
it's
just
his
ghetto
point
of
view
The
renegade,
you
been
afraid
I
penetrate
pop
culture
Bring
'em
a
lot
closer
to
the
block
where
they
pop
toasters
And
they
live
with
they
moms,
got
dropped
roadsters
From
botched
robberies,
niggas
crouched
over
Mami's
knocked
up
‘cause
she
wasn't
watched
over
Knocked
down
by
some
clown
when
child
support
knocked
"No,
he's
not
around."
Now,
how
that
sound
to
ya?
Jot
it
down
I
bring
you
through
the
ghetto
without
ridin'
round
Hidin'
down,
duckin'
strays
from
frustrated
youths
stuck
in
they
ways
Just
read
a
magazine
that
fucked
up
my
day
How
you
rate
music
that
thugs
with
nothin'
relate
to
it?
I
help
them
see
they
way
through
it—not
you
Can't
step
in
my
pants,
can't
walk
in
my
shoes
Bet
everything
you
worth,
you'll
lose
your
tie
and
your
shirt
Since
I'm
in
a
position
to
talk
to
these
kids
and
they
listen
I
ain't
no
politician,
but
I'll
kick
it
with
'em
a
minute
‘Cause,
see,
they
call
me
a
menace
and
if
the
shoe
fits,
I'll
wear
it
But
if
it
don't,
then
y'all
will
swallow
the
truth,
grin
and
bear
it
Now
who's
the
king
of
these
rude,
ludicrous,
lucrative
lyrics?
Who
could
inherit
the
title,
put
the
youth
in
hysterics
Usin'
his
music
to
steer
it,
sharin'
his
views
and
his
merits?
But
there's
a
huge
interference,
they're
sayin'
you
shouldn't
hear
it
Maybe
it's
hatred
I
spew,
maybe
it's
food
for
the
spirit
Maybe
it's
beautiful
music
I
made
for
you
to
just
cherish
But
I'm
debated,
disputed,
hated
and
viewed
in
America
As
a
motherfuckin'
drug
addict,
like
you
didn't
experiment?
Nah,
nah!—That's
when
you
start
to
stare
at
who's
in
the
mirror
And
see
yourself
as
a
kid
again,
and
you
get
embarrassed
And
I
got
nothin'
to
do
but
make
you
look
stupid
as
parents
You
fuckin'
do-gooders,
too
bad
you
couldn't
do
good
at
marriage
(Ha-ha!)
And
do
you
have
any
clue
what
I
had
to
do
to
get
here?
I
don't
think
you
do,
so
stay
tuned
and
keep
your
ears
glued
to
the
stereo
‘Cause
here
we
go,
he's
Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And
I'm
the

I

my

Pockets

Gotta

Feelin'

up,

full
of

Do

box
lefty
An
orphan
my
pops
left
me
and
often
my
momma
wasn't
home
Could
not

me,
I
wasn't
grown
'Specially

brought

home

the

My
demeanor,
thirty
years
my

My
childhood
didn't
mean
much,
only
raisin'
green
up
Raisin'
my
fingers
to
critics,
raisin'
my
head
to
the
sky
Big,
I
did
it,
multi
before
I
die
No
lie,
just
know
I
chose
my
own
fate
I
drove
by
the
fork
in
the
road
and
went
straight
See,
I'm
a
poet
to
some,

Shakespeare
Jesus

the

me

A

satanist,
scatter-brained
atheist
But
that
ain't
the
case,
see,
it's
a
matter
of
taste
We
as
a
people
decide
if
Shady's
as
bad
as
they

Or
is
he
the
latter,
a

escape?
Media
scapegoat
who

See,
it's

While
I'm

Admit

we
comin'
out
in
the
open
I'm
doin'
acid,
crack,
smack,
coke,

smokin'
dope
then
My
name
is
Marshall
Mathers,
I'm
an
alcoholic
(Hi,
Marshall)
I
have
a
disease
and
they
don't
know
what
to
call
it
Better
hide
your
wallet
'cause
I'm
comin'
up
quick
to
strip
yo'
cash
Bought
a
ticket
to

just

whip
yo'
ass
Bitch,
I'm
comin'

it'll
make

You

I'll

So
when

Glocks
Screamin',
"Fuck

My

But

but
I'm
on
a
search
to
crush
a
milkbone
I'm
everlastin',
I
melt
vanilla
ice
like
silicone
I'm
ill
enough
to
just
straight
up
diss
you
for
no
reason
I'm
colder
than
snow
season
when
it's
20
below
freezin'
Flavor
with
no
seasoning,
this
is
the
sneak
preview
I'll
diss
yo'
magazine
and
still
won't
get
a
weak
review
I'll
make
yo'
freak
leave
you,
smell
the
Folgers
crystals
This
is
lyrical
combat,
gentlemen,
hold
your
pistols
But
I
form
like
Voltron
and
blast
you
with
my
shoulder
missiles
Slim
Shady,
M&M

the
old
initials
(Bye-bye)
Extortion,
snortin',
supportin'
abortion
Pathological
liar,
blowin'
shit
outta
proportion
The
looniest,
zaniest,
spontaneous,
sporadic
Impulsive
thinker,
compulsive
drinker,
addict
Half
animal,
half
man
Dumpin'
yo'
dead
body
inside
of
a
fuckin'
trash
can
With
more
holes
than
an
afghan
So
when
you
see
me
on
yo'
block
with
two
Glocks
Screamin',
"Fuck
the
world"
like
2Pac
(I
just
don't
give
a
fuck)
Talkin'
that
shit
behind
my
back,
dirty
mackin'
Tellin'
your
boys
that
I'm
on
crack
(I
just
don't
give
a
fuck)
So
put
my
tape
back
on
the
rack,
go
run
and
tell
your
friends
My
shit
is
wack
(I
just
don't
give
a
fuck)
But
see
me
on
the
street
and
duck
'Cause
you
finna
get
stuck,
stoned,
and
snuffed
('Cause
I
just
don't
give
a
fuck)
Somebody
let
me
out
this
limousine
(Hey,
let
me
out)
I'm
a
caged
demon
On
stage
screamin'
like
Rage
Against
the
Machine
I'm
convinced
I'm
a
fiend
Shootin'
up
while
this
record
is
spinnin'
Clinically
brain-dead,
I
don't
need
a
second
opinion
Fuck
droppin'
a
jewel,
I'm
flippin'
a
sacred
treasure
I'll
bite
yo'
motherfuckin'
style
just
to
make
it
fresher
I
can't
take
the
pressure,
I'm
sick
of
bitches
Sick
of
naggin'
bosses
bitchin'
while
I'm
washin'
dishes
In
school,
I
never
said
much,
too
busy
havin'
a
head
rush
Doin'
too
much
rush,
had
my
face
flushed
like
red
blush
Then
I
went
to
Jim
Beam,
that's
when
my
face
grayed
Went
to
gym
in
eighth
grade,
*****
the
women's
swim
team
Don't
take
me
for
a
joke,
I'm
no
comedian
Too
many
mental
problems
got
me
snortin'
coke
and
smokin'
weed
again
I'm
goin'
up
over
the
curb,
drivin'
on
the
median
Finally
made
it
home
but
I
don't
got
the
key
to
get
in
So
when
you
see
me
on
yo'
block
with
two
Glocks
Screamin',
"Fuck

Lord,
please

For

I've

Father,
please

I
just
never

I
would

Momma
had
a
baby
and
its
head
popped
off
Head
popped
off,
head
popped
off,
head
popped
off,
head
popped
off,
head
popped

But
Momma
don't
want
me,
the
next
thing
I
know,
I'm
gettin'
dropped
off
Gettin'
dropped

Ring-ring-ring

Their

But
they
didn't
want
me
neither,
so
they
left
me
on
someone
else's
lawn
Else's

'Til

they

were
left

My
elementary,
they'd
gang
up
on
me
and
sing
this
song
Sing
this
song,
sing
this
song,
sing
this
song,
sing
this
song
It
went
a
little
something
like
"Mary
had
a
little
lamb,
little
lamb,
little
lamb
Debbie
had
a
Satan
spawn,
Satan
spawn"
Momma
why
do
they
keep
sayin'
this?
I
just
don't
understand,
understand
And
by
the
way,
where's
my
dad?
Father,
please
forgive
me
for
I
know
not
what
I
do
I
just
never
had
the

Predominantly,
predominantly,
everything's
always
predominantly
Predominantly-white,
predominantly
black.
Well,
what
about
me?
Where
does
that
leave
me?
Well,
I
guess
that
I'm
between
predominantly
both
of
'em
I
think
if
I
hear
that
fuckin'
word
again,
I'ma
scream
While
I'm
projectile
vomitin';
what
do
I
look
like,
a
comedian
to
you?
Do
you
think
that
I'm
kiddin'?
What
do
I
look
like,
some
kinda
idi...
Wait
a
minute,
shit,
don't
answer
that;
why
am
I
so
misunderstood?
Why
do
I
go
through
so
much
bullshit?
It's
such
bullshit,
it's
tush

"Woe

whinin'
about
his

And
his

and
his
sorrow
he's
always

And
the
dad
that
he
never

and
how
his
childhood
was
so

And
how

and

how
they

Man,
I'd
hate
to
have
it
as
bad
as
that
Mr.

claims
he
had
it
I
can't

it.

of

out

if

Shit,
if
you
only
knew
the
half
of
it...
Haha
Father,
please
forgive
me
for
I
know
not
what
I
do
I
just
never
had
the
chance
to
ever
meet
you
Therefore
I
did
not
know
that
I
would
grow
to

My
mother's
evil

Evil
deeds,
while
I
plant
these
evil
seeds
Please
release
me
from
these
demons
I
never
had
any
of
this
shit
planned,
Mom,
please
believe
I
don't
wanna
be
Satan's
spawn
Never
got
the
chance
to
say
I'm
sorry
Now
look
at
all
the
pain
I
caused
Dear
Santa
Claus,
why
are
you
not
comin'
this
year
again?
What
did
I
do
that
was
so
bad
to
deserve
this?
Everything
could
have
been
so
perfect
But
life
ain't
a
fairytale.
I'm
about
to
be
hoisted
up
in
the
air
Forty
feet
below
me
there's
people
everywhere
I
don't
even
know
but
who
feel
like
they
know
me
'cause
I'm
in
this
ferris
wheel
And
all
I
wanna
do
is
go
to
the
mall
and
take
Hailie
on
the
carousel
Without
this
crowd
everywhere
I
go,
but
life
is
like
a
merry-go-round
Here
we
go
now,
do-si-do
now,
curtains
up,
the
show
must
go
now
Ring-around-the-rosie,
the
show's
over,
you
can
all
go
home
now
But
the
curtain
just
don't
close
for
me,
this
ain't
how
fame
was
supposed
to
be
Where's
the
switch
I
could
just
turn
off-and-on?
This
ain't
what
I
chose
to
be
So
please,
God,
give
me
the
strength
to
have
what
it
takes
to
carry
on
'Til
I
pass
50
back
the
baton,
the
camera's
on,
my
soul
is
gone
Father,
please
forgive
me
for
I
know
not
what
I
do
I
just
never
had
the
chance
to
ever
meet
you
Therefore
I
did
not
know
that
I
would
grow
to
be
My
mother's
evil
seed
and
do

I
said,
Father,
please
forgive
me
for
I
know
not
what
I
do
I
just
never
had
the

I
did

I
would

evil

Oh!
Last
one,
baby,
let's
go
Last
one,
baby,
let's
go
Detroit!
There's
not
much
you
could
do
or
say
to
phase
me
People
think
I'm
a
little
bit
crazy
I
get
it
from
all
angles,
even
occasionally
Doc
Dre-zie
Will
have
to
step
in
every
once
in
a
while
to
save
me
To
make
me
stop
and
think
about
it
'fore
I
just
say
things
Sometimes
I
forget
what
other
people
just
may
think
A
lot
of
rappers
probably
wouldn't
know
how
to
take
me
If
they
heard
some
shit,
I'd
lay
the
tape
'fore
they
erased
me
I
may
be
a
little
too
fast-paced
and
racy
Sometimes
the
average
listener
rewinds
and
plays
me
Twenty
times
'cause
I
say
so
many
rhymes
it
may
seem
Like
I'm
goin'
too
fast
'cause
my
mind
is
racing
And
I
could
give
a
fuck
what
category
you
place
me
Long
as
when
I'm
pushing
up
daisies
And
gone
as
long
as
you
place
me
amongst
one
of
them
greats
When
I
hit
the
heavenly
gates
I'll
be
cool
beside
Jay-Z
For
every
single
die-hard
fan
who
embraced
me
I'm
thankful
for
the
talent
in
which
God
gave
me
And
I'm
thankful
for
the
environment
that
he
placed
me
Believe
it
or
not,
I
thank
my
mom
for
how
she
raised
me
In
the
neighborhood
daily
that
jumped
and
chased
me
It
only
made
me
what
I
am
today,
see
Regardless
of
what
anybody
believes
who
hates
me
You
ain't
gonna
make
or
break
me
Tryna
strip
me
of
my
credibility
and
make
me
look
fake,
G
You're
only
gonna
be
in
for
a
rude
awakening
'Cause
sooner
or
later
you
haters
are
all
gonna
face
me
And
when
you
face
me
with
all
the
shit
you've
been
saving
To
say
to
me,
you
had
all
this
time
to
think
about
it
Now
don't
pussy
out
and
try
to
about
face
me
'Cause
I've
been
patiently
waiting
for
the
day
That
we
finally
meet
in
the
same
place
to
see
No
matter
how
many
battles
I
been
in
and
won
No
matter
how
many
magazines
on
my
nuts
No
matter
how
many
emcees
I
eat
up
Oh,
it's
never
enough
No
matter
how
many
battles
I
been
in
and
won
No
matter
how
many
magazines
on
my
nuts
No
matter
how
many
emcees
I
eat
up
Oh
oh,
it's
never
enough
My
flow's
untouchable,
now
you
gotta
face
it
Uh
oh,
it
gets
worse
when
I
go
back
to
the
basics
You
gon'
say
the
wrong
shit
and
get
your
whole
face
split
The
smell
of
victory,
love
it
so
much
I
can
taste
it
I
spot
my
target,
blaze
it,
direct
hit
Graze
it,
your
peace
talk,
save
it
Your
shit
sounds
dated,
you're
overrated
I'm
obligated
to
study
your
moves
then
crush
you
motherfuckers
If
I'm
the
best
and
the
worst,
then
God's
gift
is
a
curse
Soldier
trained
to
destroy
–
you
payin'
attention,
boy?
I
spit
shit,
slick
shit,
so
quick
you
miss
it
To
be
specific
I
go
ballistic
as
hieroglyphic
My
music
is
a
drug,
press
play,
you
ain't
gotta
sniff
it
Shoot
it
or
pop
it,
roll
it,
bag
it
or
chop
it
It'll
get
you
high
over
and
over,
but
you
gotta
cop
it
When
it's
hot,
it's
hot,
your
hatin'
is
undeniable,
stop
it
No
matter
how
many
battles
I
been
in
and
won
No
matter
how
many
magazines
on
my
nuts
No
matter
how
many
emcees
I
eat
up
Oh,
it's
never
enough

"What
we
have
to
do
is
deal
with
it
when
these
individuals
are
young
enough,
if
you
will,
to
be
saved,
not
in
a
religious
sense,
but
not
to
constitute
what
this
country
at
times
calls
(Yeah)
their
throwaway
children."
"We
seem
to
be
approaching
(C'mon!)
an
age
of
the
gross."
(*Burp*)
"We
all
have
this
idea
that
we
should
move
up
a
little
bit
from
our
parents'
station
and
each
generation
should
do
a
little
bit
better."
All
right,
come
on,
let's
cut
the
bullshit,
enough
Let's
get
it
started,
let's
start
addressin'
this
issue,
and
open
it
up
Let's
take
this
shit
back
to
the
basement
and
we
can
discuss
Statements
that's
made
on
this
tape
and
its
whole
origin
of
The
music
that
we
all
know
and
love,
the
music
we
all
enjoy
The
music
you
accuse
me
of
tryin'
to
destroy
Let's
rewind
it
to
'89
when
I
was
a
boy
On
the
East
Side
of
Detroit,
crossin'
8
Mile
into
Warren
Into
hick
territory;
I'd
like
to
share
a
story
This
is
my
story,
and
can't
nobody
tell
it
for
me
You
have
well
informed
me,
I
am
well-aware
That
I
don't
belong
here:
you've
made
that
perfectly
clear
I
get
my
ass
kicked
damn
near
everywhere
From
Bel-Aire
shopping
center
just
for
stoppin'
in
there
From
the
black
side
all
the
way
to
the
white
side
Okay,
there's
a
bright
side,
a
day
that
I
might
slide
You
may
call
it
a
pass,
I
call
it
haulin'
my
ass
Through
that
patch
of
grass
over
them
railroad
tracks
Oh,
them
railroad
tracks,
them
old
railroad
tracks
Them
good
old
notorious
so
well
known
tracks
So,
let's
go
back,
follow
the
yellow
brick
road
As
we
go
on
another
episode
Journey
with
me
as
I
take
you
through
this
nifty
little
place
That
I
once
used
to
call
home
sweet
home
Come
on,
let's
go
back,
follow
the
yellow
brick
road
As
we
go
on
another
episode
Journey
with
me
as
I
take
you
through
this
nifty
little
place
That
I
once
used
to
call
home
sweet
home
I'd
roam
the
streets
so
much
they
called
me
a
drifter
Sometimes
I'd
stick
up
a
thumb
just
to
hitchhike
Just
to
get
picked
up
to
get
me
a
lift
to
8
Mile
and
Van
Dyke
or
steal
a
goddamn
bike
From
somebody's
backyard,
and
drop
it
off
at
the
park
That
was
the
halfway
mark,
to
meet
Kim
had
to
walk
Back
to
her
mama's
on
Chalmers
after
dark
To
sneak
me
in
the
house
when
I'm
kicked
out
my
mom's
That's
about
the
time
I
first
met
Proof
With
Goofy
Gary
on
the
steps
at
Osborn,
handin'
out
some
flyers
We
was
doin'
some
talent
shows
at
Center
Line
High
I
told
him
to
stop
by
and
check
us
out
sometime
He
looked
at
me
like
I'm
out
my
mind
Shook
his
head,
like,
"White
boys
don't
know
how
to
rhyme."
I
spit
out
a
line
and
rhymed
"birthday"
with
"first
place"
And
we
both
had
the
same
rhymes
that
sound
alike
We
was
on
the
same
shit,
that
Big
Daddy
Kane
shit
Where
compound
syllables
sound
combined
From
that
day
we
was
down
to
ride
Somehow
we
knew
we'd
meet
again
somewhere
down
the
line
So,
let's
go
back,
follow
the
yellow
brick
road
As
we
go
on
another
episode
Journey
with
me
as
I

nifty

That

Come
on,
let's
go
back,
follow
the
yellow
brick
road
As
we
go
on
another
episode
Journey
with
me
as
I
take
you
through
this
nifty
little
place
That
I
once
used
to
call
home
sweet
home
My
first
year
in
9th
grade,
can't
forget
that
day
at
school
It
was
cool
'til
your
man
MC
Shan
came
through
He
said
that
Puma's
the
brand
‘cause
the
Klan
makes
Troops
It
was
rumors,
but
man,
goddamn,
they
flew
Musta
been
true,
because
man,
we
done
banned
they
shoes
I
had
the
new
ones,
the
Cool
J
Ice
Lamb,
suede
too
But
we
just
threw
'em
in
the
trash
like
they
yesterday's
news
Guess
who
came
through
next?
X
Clan
debuted
Professor
X
(Vanglorious!)
"Exist
in
a
state
of
red
Black
and
green,
with
a
key,
sissies!"
Now
with
this
bein'
the
new
trend,
we
don't
fit
in
Crackas
is
out
with
Cactus
Albums,
blackness
is
in
African
symbols
and
medallions
represent
Black
Power
And
we
ain't
know
what
it
meant,
me
and
my
man
Howard
And
Butter
would
go
to
the
mall
With
'em
all
over
our
necks
like
we're
showin'
'em
off
Not
knowin'
at
all
we
was
bein'
laughed
at
"You
ain't
even
half
black!
You
ain't
'posed
to
have
that
Homie,
let
me
grab
that!
And
that
Flavor
Flav
clock
We
gon'
have
to
snatch
that!"
All
I
remember
is
meetin'
back
at
Manix's
basement,
sayin'
how
we
hate
this
How
racist
but
dope
the
X
Clan's
tape
is
Which
reminds
me,
back
in
'89,
me
And
Kim
broke
up
for
the
first
time;
she
was
tryin'
to
two-time
me
And
there
was
this
black
girl
at
our
school,
who
thought
I
was
cool
‘Cause
I
rapped,
so
she
was
kinda
eyein'
me
And
oh
the
irony,
guess
what
her
name
was?
Ain't
even
gonna
say
it,
plus
The
same
color
hair
as
hers
was
and
blue
contacts
And
a
pair
of
jugs,
the
bombest
goddamn
Girl
in
our
whole
school,
if
I
could
pull
her,
not
only
would
I
become
More
popular,
but
I
would
be
able
to
piss
Kim
off
At
the
same
time,
but
it
backfired
I
was
supposed
to
dump
her,
but
she
dumped
me
for
this
black
guy
And
that's
the
last
I
ever
seen
or
heard
Or
spoke
to
the
"Ole
Foolish
Pride"
girl,
but
I've
heard
People
say
they
heard
the
tape
and
it
ain't
that
bad
But
it
was:
I
singled
out
a
whole
race
And
for
that
I
apologize,
I
was
wrong
‘Cause
no
matter
what
color
a
girl
is,
she's
still
a—
So,
let's
go
back,

the
yellow
brick
road
As

Come
on,
let's
go
back,
follow
the
yellow
brick
road
As
we
go
on
another
episode
Journey
with

I
take
you
through
this
nifty
little

That
I
once
used
to
call
home
sweet
home
Fuck
out
of
my
house,
you
fuckin'
pieces
of
shit!
Get
the
fuck
out
of
my
house,
you
stupid
fucker!
You
son
of
a
bitch!
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left,
we
all
fall
down
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left,
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win,
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
I'm
supposed
to
be
the
soldier
who
never
blows
his
composure
Even
though
I
hold
the
weight
of
the
whole
world
on
my
shoulders
I
ain't
never
supposed
to
show
it,
my
crew
ain't
supposed
to
know
it
Even
if
it
means
goin'
toe-to-toe
with
a
Benzino
It
don't
matter,
I
never
drag
'em
in
battles
that
I
can't
handle
'Less
I
absolutely
have
to,
I'm
supposed
to
set
an
example
I
need
to
be
the
leader,
my
crew
looks
for
me
to
guide
'em
If
some
shit
ever
does
pop
off,
I'm
supposed
to
be
beside
'em
That
Ja
shit,
I
tried
to
squash
it,
it
was
too
late
to
stop
it
There's
a
certain
line
you
just
don't
cross,
and
he
crossed
it
I
heard
him
say
Hailie's
name
on
a
song
and
I
just
lost
it
It
was
crazy,
the
shit
went
way
beyond
some
JAY-Z
and
Nas
shit
And
even
though
the
battle
was
won,
I
feel
like
we
lost
it
I
spent
so
much
energy
on
it,
honestly
I'm
exhausted
And
I'm
so
caught
in
it
that
I
almost
feel
I'm
the
one
who
caused
it
This
ain't
what
I'm
in
hip-hop
for,
that's
not
why
I
got
in
it
That
was
never
my
object,
for
someone
to
get
killed
Why
would
I
wanna
destroy
something
I
helped
build?
That
wasn't
my
intentions,
my
intentions
were
good
I
went
through
my
whole
career
without
ever
mentionin'
****
And
that
was
just
outta
respect,
for
not
runnin'
my
mouth
And
talkin'
about
somethin'
that
I
knew
nothin'
about
Plus
Dre
told
me
stay
out,
this
just
wasn't
my
beef
So
I
did,
I
just
fell
back,
watched
and
gritted
my
teeth
While
he's
all
over
TV,
down-talkin'
the
man
Who
literally
saved
my
life,
like
fuck
it,
I
understand
This
is
business,
and
this
shit
just
isn't
none
of
my
business
But
still
knowin'
the
shit
could
pop
off
at
any
minute,
‘cause—
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left,
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win,
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
There
used
to
be
a
time
when
you
could
just
say
a
rhyme
and
Wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
one
of
your
people
dyin'
But
now
it's
elevated,
‘cause
once
you
put
someone's
kids
in
it
The
shit
gets
escalated
—
it
ain't
just
words
no
more,
is
it?
It's
a
different
ballgame,
you
call
names
and
you
ain't
just
rappin'
We
actually
tried
to
stop
the
50
and
Ja
beef
from
happenin'
Me
and
Dre
had
sat
with
him,
kicked
it
and
had
a
chat
with
him
And
asked
him
not
to
start
it,
he
wasn't
gonna
go
after
him
Until
Ja
started
yappin'
in
magazines
how
he
stabbed
him
Fuck
it,
50,
smash
him!
Mash
on
him,
let
him
have
it
Meanwhile
my
attention's
pulled
in
another
direction
Some
receptionist
at
The
Source
who
answers
phones
at
his
desk
Has
an
erection
for
me
and
thinks
that
I'll
be
his
resurrection
Tries
to
blow
the
dust
off
his
mic
and
make
a
new
record
But
now
he's
fucked
the
game
up
'cause
one
of
the
ways
I
came
up
Was
through
that
publication,
the
same
one
that
made
me
famous
Now
the
owner
of
it
has
got
a
grudge
against
me
for
nothin'?
Well,
fuck
it,
that
motherfucker
could
get
it
too,
fuck
him
then!
But
I'm
so
busy
bein'
pissed
off,
I
don't
stop
to
think
That
we
just
inherited
50's
beef
with
Murder
Inc.
And
he's
inherited
mine,
which
is
fine,
ain't
like
either
of
us
mind
But
we
still
have
soldiers
that's
on
the
front
line
Who's
willin'
to
die
for
us
as
soon
as
we
give
the
orders
Never
to
extort
us,
strictly
to
show
they
support
us
And
maybe
shout
'em
out
in
a
rap
or
up
in
a
chorus
To
show
'em
we
love
'em
back
and
let
'em
know
how
important
it
is
To
have
Runyon
Avenue
soldiers
up
in
our
corners
Their
loyalty
to
us
is
worth
more
than
any
award
is
But
I
ain't
tryna
have
none
of
my
people
hurt
or
murdered
It
ain't
worth
it,
I
can't
think
of
a
perfecter
way
to
word
it
Than
to
just
say
that
I
love
y'all
too
much
to
see
the
verdict
I'll
walk
away
from
it
all
'fore
I
let
it
go
any
further
But
don't
get
it
twisted,
it's
not
a
plea
that
I'm
coppin'
I'm
just
willin'
to
be
the
bigger
man,
if
y'all
can
quit
poppin'
Off
at
the
jaws,
well,
then
I
can,
‘cause
frankly
I'm
sick
of
talkin'
I'm
not
gonna
let
someone
else's
coffin
rest
on
my
conscience
‘cause—
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left,
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win,
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
I
pledge
allegiance
to
the
flag
Of
the
United
States
of
America
And
to
the
republic
for
which
it
stands
People!
One
nation,
under
God,
indivisible
It
feels
so
good
to
be
back!
With
liberty
and
justice
for
all
Mosh
with
me
now!
Scrutinize
every
word,
memorize
every
line
I
spit
it
once,
refuel,
re-energize,
and
rewind
I
give
sight
to
the
blind,
my
insight
through
the
mind
I
exercise
my
right
to
express
when
I
feel
it's
time
It's
just
all
in
your
mind,
what
you
interpret
it
as
I
say
to
fight
and
you
take
it
as
"I'ma
whip
someone's
ass"
If
you
don't
understand,
don't
even
bother
to
ask
A
father
who
has
grown
up
with
a
fatherless
past
Who
has
blown
up
now
to
rap
phenomenon
that
has
Or
at
least
shows
no
difficulty
multi-taskin'
And
juggling
both,
perhaps
mastered
his
craft
slash
Entrepreneur,
who's
helped
launch
a
few
more
rap
acts
Who's
had
a
few
obstacles
thrown
his
way
through
the
last
half
Of
his
career,
typical
manure,
moving
past
that
Mr.
Kiss-His-Ass-Crack,
he's
a
class
act
Rubberband
Man
–
yeah,
he
just
snaps
back
Come
along,
follow

As
I
lead
through
the
darkness
As
I
provide
just
enough

To
proceed,
carry
on,
give
me
hope
Give
me
strength,
come
with

We

We

We

Take

All

people
up
top,
on
the
side
and
the
middle
Come
together,
let's
all
form
and
swarm
just
a
little
Just
let
it
gradually
build
from
the
front
to
the
back
All
you
can
see
is
a
sea
of
people,
some
white
and
some
black
Don't
matter
what
color,
all
that
matters
we're
gathered
together
To
celebrate
for
the
same
cause,
no
matter
the
weather
If
it
rains,
let
it
rain
–
yeah,
the
wetter
the
better
They
ain't
gon'
stop
us,
they
can't
We're
stronger
now
more
than
ever
They
tell
us
"No!"
we
say
"Yeah!"
They
tell
us
"Stop!"
we
say
"Go!"
Rebel
with
a
rebel
yell,
raise
hell,
we
gon'
let
'em
know
Stomp,

Until
they
bring
our
troops
home,
come
on,

Come

through

To

We

Take

right
through
the

come
on!
Imagine
it
pourin',
just
rainin'
down
on
us
Mosh
pits
outside
the
Oval
Office
Someone's
tryin'
to
tell
us
somethin',
maybe
this
is
God
just
Sayin'
we're
responsible
for
this
monster,
this
coward
That
we
have
empowered,
this
is
Bin
Laden
Look
at
his
head
noddin',
how
could
we
allow
Somethin'
like
this
without
pumpin'
our
fists?
Now
This
is
our
final
hour
Let
me
be
the
voice
and
your
strength
and
your
choice
Let
me
simplify
the
rhyme
just
to
amplify
the
noise
Try
to
amplify
it,
times-it,
and
multiply
it
by
six
-teen
million
people,
all
equal
at
this
high
pitch
Maybe
we
can
reach
Al-Qaeda
through
my
speech
Let
the
President
answer
a
higher
anarchy
Strap
him
with
an
AK-47,
let
him
go
Fight
his
own
war,
let
him
impress
Daddy
that
way
No
more
blood
for
oil,
we
got
our
own
battles
To
fight
on
our
own
soil,
no
more
psychological
warfare
To
trick
us
to
thinkin'
that
we
ain't
loyal
If
we
don't
serve
our
own
country
We're
patronizin'
a
hero;
look
in
his
eyes,
it's
all
lies
The
stars
and
stripes
have
been
swiped,
washed
out
and
wiped
And
replaced
with
his
own
face,
mosh
now
or
die
If
I
get
sniped
tonight,
you'll
know
why—‘cause
I
told
you
to
fight!
Come
along,
follow
me
As
I
lead
through
the
darkness
As
I
provide
just
enough
spark
that
we

To

give

Give

And
I

To

We

mosh

Take
us
right
through
the
doors,
come
on!
And
as
we
proceed
To
mosh
through
this
desert
storm
And
these
closing
statements
If
they
should
argue,
let
us
beg
to
differ
As
we
set
aside
our
differences
And
assemble
our
own
army
To
disarm
this
weapon
of
mass
destruction
That
we
call
our
President,
for
the
present
And
mosh
for
the
future
of
our
next
generation
To
speak
and
be
heard
Mr.
President!
Mr.
Senator!
Can
you
guys
hear
us?

There
I
go,
thinking
of
you
again
You
don't
know
how
sick
you
make
me
You
make
me
fucking
sick
to
my
stomach
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
You
must
just
not
kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You
may
not
think
you
do,
but
you
do
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
I
was
gonna
take
the
time
to
sit
down
and
write
you
a
little
poem
But
off
of
the
dome
would
probably
be
a
little
more
More
suitable
for
this
type
of
song,
whoa
I
got
a
million
reasons
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
I
could
think
of
Sixteen
bars
just
ain't
enough
to
put
some
ink
to
So
fuck
it,
I'ma
start
right
here,
I'll
just
be
brief,
I'm
'Bout
to
rattle
off
some
of
the
reasons
I
knew
I
shouldn't
go
and
get
another
tattoo
Of
you
on
my
arm,
but
what
do
I
go
and
do?
I
go
and
get
another
one,
now
I
got
two
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now
I'm
sitting
here
with
your
name
on
my
skin
I
can't
believe
I
went
and
did
this
stupid
shit
again
My
next
girlfriend,
now
her
name's
gotta
be
Kim
(Shi-i-i-i-i-i-it)
If
you
only
knew
how
much
I
hated
you
For
every
motherfucking
thing
you've
ever
put
us
through
Then
I
wouldn't
be
standing
here
crying
over
you
(Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo)
You
don't
know
how
sick
you
make
me
You
make
me
fucking
sick
to
my
stomach
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
You
must
just
not
kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You
may
not
think
you
do,
but
you
do
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
I
was
gonna
take
the
time
to
sit
down
and
write
you
a
little
letter
But
I
thought
a
song
would
probably
be
a
little
better
Instead
of
a
letter
that
you'd
probably
just
shred
up,
yeah
I
stumbled
on
your
picture
yesterday
and
it
made
me
stop
and
think
of
How
much
of
a
waste
it'd
be
for
me
to
put
some
ink
to,
a
stupid
piece
of
Paper,
I'd
rather
let
you
see
how
Much
I
fucking
hate
you
in
a
freestyle
You're
a
fucking
cokehead
slut,
I
hope
you
fucking
die
I
hope
you
get
to
hell
and
Satan
sticks
a
needle
in
your
eye
I
hate
your
fucking
guts,
you
fucking
slut,
I
hope
you
die
(Di-i-i-i-i-i-ie)
But
please
don't
get
me
wrong,
I'm
not
bitter
or
mad
It's
not
that
I
still
love
you,
it's
not
'cause
I
want
you
back
It's
just
that
when
I
think
of
you
it
makes
me
wanna
yack
(A-a-a-a-a-a-ack)
But
what
else
can
I
do?
I
haven't
got
a
clue
Now
I
guess
I'll
just
move
on,
I
have
no
choice
but
to
But
every
time
I
think
of
you
now
all
I
wanna
do
is
pu-u-u-u-u-u-uke
You
don't
know
how
sick
you
make
me
You
make
me
fucking
sick
to
my
stomach
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
You
must
just
not
kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You
may
not
think
you
do,
but
you
do
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I

Shady's
the
label,
Aftermath
is
the
stable
That
the
horses
come
out
of—erra
Of
course
we're
about
to
stir
up
Some
shit
thick
as
Mrs.
Buttersworth's
syrup
It's
the
Mr.
Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason
Other
than
to—just
to
tease
him
'Cause
he
was
his
biggest
(*burp*)
fan
He
used
to
be
Superman,
now
I'm
pourin'
Liquor
on
the
curb
in
his
name
for
him
"Eminem,
you
wait
'til
we
meet
up
again,
fucker
I'm
kickin'
your
ass
for
everything
you've
ever
said."
It
goes
one
for
the
money,
two
for
the
fuckin'
show
Ready,
get
set,
let's
go
Here
comes
the
buckin'
bronco
Stompin'
and
stampedin'
up
the
damn
street
like
them
buffalo
Soldiers,
I
told
ya
I'm
'bout
to
blow,
so
look
out
below,
Geronimo
Motherfuckers,
it's
dominoes,
I'm
on
a
roll
Around
and
around
I
go
When
will
I
stop?
I
don't
know
Tryin'
to
pick
up
where
The
Eminem
Show
left
off
But
I
know
anything's
possible
Though
I'm
not
gonna
top
what
I
sold
I'm
at
the
top
of
my
game,
that
shit
is
not
gonna
change
Long
as
I
got
Dr.
Dre
on
my
team
I'll
get
away
With
murder:
I'm
like
O.J.,
he's
like
my
Cochran
today
We
keep
the
Mark
Fuhrman
tapes
In
a
safe,
locked
'em
away
(*slam*)
Better
watch
what
you
say
Just
when
you
thought
you
were
safe
Them
fuckers
got
you
on
tape
You
swear
to
God
you
was
playin'
Whether
or
not
you
was
little
Joshua
Gosh,
I
wish
I
could've
told
you
to
not
do
the
same
'Cause
one
day
it
could
cost
you
your
name
And
this
was
supposed
to
be
my
first
single
(*burp*)
But
I
just
fucked
that
up,
so
Fuck
it,
let's
all
have
fun,
let's
mingle
(*burp*)
Slap
a
bitch
and
smack
a
ho
This
was
supposed
to
be
my
catchy
little
jingle
(*fart*)
That
you
hear
on
your
radio
But
shit's
about
to
hit
the
shingle
(*fart*)

swallowed

pills

up

next
to

best
friend
Derrick,
bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean

turned

a

Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee

let
me
ask
you
again
Am
I
just

Am

recently
somebody
just
discovered
Britney
and
Justin
videotapes
of
'em
fuckin'
When
they
was
just
Mouseketeers
in
the
Mickey
Mouse
Club
And
dusted
'em
and
went
straight
to
The
Source
with
'em
'Cause
they
could've
sworn
someone
said,
"Ni—"
And
then
tried
to
erase
and
record
over
it
But
if
you
listen
close
enough
to
it
you
can
hear
the
"Ga-hu"
and
then
they
come
to
Find
out
it
was
Justin
sayin',
"I'm
gon—nuh
cum!"
And
this
was
supposed
to
be.
my
first
single
(*burp*)
But
I
just
fucked
that
up,
so
Fuck
it,
let's
all
have
fun,
let's
mingle
(*burp*)
Slap
a
bitch
and
smack
a
ho
This
was
supposed
to
be
my
catchy
little
jingle
(*fart*)
That
you
hear
on
your
radio
But
shit's
about
to
hit
the
shingle
(*fart*)
Oh,

Any
opinions
or
somethin'
you
just
wanna
get
off
your
chest
And
address
it
about
my
lyrics
I'd
love
to
hear
it
All
you
gotta
do
is
pick
up
the
phone
and
just
dial
up
this
number
It's
1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK
And
if
someone
picks
up
You
can
talk
all
the
shit
you
want
about
me
Just
type
in
your
number
back
and
follow
it
by
the
pound
key
And
I'll
be
sure
to
get
back
as
soon
as
there
comes
a
day
That
I
fall
out
with
Dre,
wake
up
gay
and
make
up
with
Ray
(hey!)
So
fuck
a
chicken,
lick
a
chicken,
suck
a
chicken,
beat
a
chicken
Eat
a
chicken
like
it's
a
big
cock,
big-a-big-cock!
Or
suck
a
dick,
and
lick
a
dick,
and
eat
a
dick,
and
stick
a
dick
in
your
mouth
I'm
done,
you
can
fuck
off,
fuck-a-fuck-off!
And
this
was
supposed
to
be
my
first
single
(*burp*)
But
I
just
fucked
that
up,
so
Fuck
it,
let's
all
have

let's

Slap

Hey
Em,
it's
Paul,
uh,
listen,
I
just
got
a
call
from
the
label
And
you're
probably
not
gonna
be
surprised
but,
um
Michael
Jackson
is
extremely
upset
about
the
"Just
Lose
It"
video
And,
um,
I
mean
he's
pissed,
so
I
don't
know
what
he's
gonna
do
But
we
gotta
talk
about
how
we're
gonna
handle
this
Um,
oh
yeah,
anyway,
somebody
told
me
that,
um
They
heard
a
rumor
that
you
got
a
new
gun
Um,
I
know
it's
probably
not
true
But
I
just
need
to
talk
to
you
about
that
So,
um,
gimme
a
call
Yeah
Definitely,
definitely
Definitely
dope
Definitely
Definitely
K-Mart
Yeah,
yeah
(*fart*)
You
find
me
offensive
I
find
you
offensive
for
finding
me
offensive
Hence,
if
I
should
draw
out
or
line
any
fences
If
so,
to
what
extent,
if
any,
should
I
go?
'Cause
it's
getting
expensive
Being
on
the
other
side
of
the
courtroom
on
the
defensive
They
say
I
cause
extensive
Psychological
nerve
damage
to
the
brain
When
I
go
to
lengths
this
far
at
other
people's
expenses
I
say
you're
all
just
too
goddamn
sensitive
It's
censorship
and
it's
downright
blasphemous
Let's
end
this
shit
now
'cause
I
won't
stand
for
this
And
Christopher
Reeves
won't
sit
for
this
neither
And
let's
clear
this
up
too,
I
ain't
got
no
beef
with
him
either
He
used
to
be
like
a
hero
to
me,
I
even
believe
I
Had
one
of
those
25
cent
stickers
on
my
refrigerator
Right
next
to
Darth
Vader
And
Darth
must've
put
a
hex
on
him
for
later
I
feel
like
it's
my
fault
'cause
of
the
way
that
I
stuck
him
up
in
between
him
and
Lex
Luthor
I
killed
Superman,
I
killed
Super-man
And
how
ironic
That
I'd
be
the
bad
guy,
kryptonite,
the
green
chronic
'Cause
I
ain't
got
no
legs
Or
no
brain
Nice
to
meet
you
Hi,
my
name
is...
I
forgot
my
name
My
aim
was
not
to
become
what
I
became
With
this
level
of
fame
My
soul
is
possessed
by
this
devil
My
new
name
is
Rain
Man
Now
in
the
bible,
it
says
Thou
shalt
not
watch
two
lesbians
in
bed
Have
homosexual
sex
Unless
of
course
you
were
given
the
consent
to
join
in
Then
of
course
it's
intercourse
and
it's
bisexual
sex
Which
isn't
as
bad
Long
as
you
show
some
remorse
for
your
actions
Either
before,
during,
or
after
Performing
the
act
of
that
which
Is
normally
referred
to
as
such
more
commonly
known
phrases
That
are
more
used
by
today's
kids
in
a
more
derogatory
way
But
who's
to
say
what's
fair
to
say
and
what
not
to
say?
Let's
ask
Dr.
Dre
Dr.
Dre
(What
up?)
I
got
a
question
if
I
may
(Yeah)
Is
it
gay
to
play
putt-putt
golf
with
a
friend
(Yeah)
And
watch
his
butt
butt
when
he
tees
off
(Yeah)
But,
but,
I
ain't
done
yet
In
football
the
quarterback
yells
out,
"Hut-hut"
While
he
reaches
in
another
grown
man's
ass
Grabs
on
his
nuts
but
just
what
if
It
was
never
meant,
it
was
just
an
accident
But
he
tripped,
fell,
slipped,
and
his
penis
went
in
His
teeny
tiny
little
round
hiney
and
he
didn't
mean
it
But
his
little
weenie
flinched
just
a
little
bit
And
I
don't
need
to
go
into
any
more
details,
but
What
if
he
pictured
it
as
a
female's
butt
Is
that
gay?
I
just
need
to
clear
things
up
'Til
then,
I'll
just
walk
around
with
a
manly
strut
because
'Cause
I
ain't
got
no
legs
Or
no
brain
Nice
to

you

You
find

I
find
you
offensive
Shit,
this
is
the
same
verse,
I
just
did
this
When
am
I
gonna
come
to
my
good
senses?
Probably
the
day
Bush
comes
to
my
defenses
My
spider
sense
is
telling
me
Spider-Man
is
nearby
And
my
plan
is
to
get
him
next
And
open
up
a
whoop
ass
canister
Goddammit
Dre,
where's
the
goddamn
beat?
(Yeah)
Anyway,
anyway,
I
don't
know
how
else
to
put
it
This
is
the
only
thing
that
I'm
good
at
I
am
the
bad
guy,
kryptonite,
the
green
chronic
Demonic,
yup,
yup,
don't
worry,
I'm
on
it
I
got
it,
high-five
Nick
Lachey
Stuck
a
pin
in
Jessica's
head
and
walked
away
And
as
she
flew
around
the
room
like
a
balloon,
I
Grabbed
the
last
can
of
chicken
tuna
out
the
trash
can
And
zoomed,
I
headed
straight
back
to
the
Neverland
Ranch
With
a
peanut
butter
jelly
chicken
tuna
sandwich
And
I
ain't
even
gotta
make
no
goddamn
sense
I
just
did
a
whole
song
and
I
didn't
say
shit
'Cause
I
ain't
got
no
legs
Or
no
brain
Nice

and

and

Yeah
I
don't
understand
Why
are
you
being
so
mean?
You're
a
mean,
mean
man
You're
just
jealous
of
me
'cause
you,
you
just
can't
do
what
I
do
So
instead
of
just
admitting
it,
you
walk
around
and
say
All
kinds
of
really
mean
things
about
me
'Cause
you're
a
meanie,
a
meanie
But
it's
only
'cause
you're
just
really
jealous
of
me
'Cause
I'm
what
you
wanna
be,
so
you
just
look
like
an
idiot
When
you
say
these
mean
things,
'cause
it's
too
easy
to
see
You're
really
just
a
big
weenie,
big
weenie
Alright,
listen,
I
need
you
to
focus
I
need
you
to
go
dig
deep
in
your
mind,
this
is
important
We
are
going
to
perform
an
experiment
of
the
sorts
I'm
going
to
have
to
ask
you
to
bear
with
me
for
a
moment
Now
I
need
you
to
open
your
mind,
your
eyes,
close
'em
You
are
now
about
to
be
placed
under
my
hypnosis
For
the
next
four
and
a
half
minutes,
we
are
going
to
explore
Into
your
mind
to
find
out
why
you're
so
fucking
jealous
Now
why
did
they
make
yoo-hoo?
Pippity-kaka-poo-poo
Psych,
I'm
kidding,
I
just
wanted
to
see
if
you're
still
listening
Okay,
now
I
need
your
undivided
attention
Sir,
I
have
a
question,
why
do
I
always
sense
this
undeniable
tension?
From
the
moment
that
I
enter
into
the
room
it
gets
all
quiet
and
whispers
Whenever
there's
conversation,
why
am
I
always
mentioned?
I've
been
dying
to
ask,
it's
been
itching
at
me,
is
it
just
because...
You're
just
jealous
of
me
'cause
you,
you
just
can't
do
what
I
do
So
instead
of
just
admitting
it,
you
walk
around
and
say
All
kinds
of
really
mean
things
about
me
'Cause
you're
a
meanie,
a
meanie
But
it's
only
'cause
you're
just
really
jealous
of
me
'Cause
I'm
what
you
wanna
be,
so
you
just
look
like
an
idiot
When
you
say
these
mean
things,
'cause
it's
too
easy
to
see
You're
really
just
a
big
weenie,
big
weenie
Alright
now
I
(Shit),
I
just
flubbed
a
line
I
was
going
to
say
something
extremely
important
But
I
forgot
who
or
what
it
was,
I
fucked
up
Psych,
I'm
kidding
again,
you
idiot,
no,
I
didn't
That's
just
what
you
wanted
to
hear
from
me
is
that
I
fucked
up,
ain't
it?
But
I
can
bust
one
take
without
looking
at
no
paper
It
doesn't
take
a
bunch
of
takes
or
me
to
stand
here
in
this
booth
all
day
For
me
to
say
the
truth,
okay?
You're
drooling,
you
have
tooth
decay
Your
mouth
is
open,
you're
disgusting,
what
the
fuck
you
eat
for
lunch?
A
bunch
of
sweets
or
something?
What,
you
munch
a
bunch
of
Crunch
'n
Munch?
Your
tooth
is
rotten
to
the
gum,
your
breath
stinks,
wanna
chew
some
gum?
"Yes,
I
do,
sir,
what
am
I
on?"
You,
sir,
are
on
truth
serum
"Marshall,
I'm
so
jealous
of
you,
please
say
you
won't
tell
nobody
I'd
be
so
embarrassed,
I'm
just
absolutely
terrified
That
someone's
gonna
find
out
why
I'm
saying
all
these
terrible
Evil
and
awful
mean
things,
it's
my
own
insecurities"
You're
just
jealous
of
me
'cause
you,
you
just
can't
do
what
I
do
So
instead
of
just
admitting
it,
you
walk
around
and
say
All
kinds
of
really
mean
things
about
me
'Cause
you're
a
meanie,
a
meanie
But
it's
only
'cause
you're
just
really
jealous
of
me
'Cause
I'm
what
you
wanna
be,
so
you
just
look
like
an
idiot
When
you
say
these
mean
things,
'cause
it's
too
easy
to
see
You're
really
just
a
big
weenie,
big
weenie
Alright,
now
we,
we're
going
to
conduct
That
experiment
that
we
were
talking
about
earlier
Just
to
see
what
a
frog
looks
like
when
it
takes
two
hits
of
ecstasy
'Cause
that's
exactly
what
your
eyes
look
like,
wanna
check
to
see?
Here's
a
mirror,
notice
the
resemblance
here?
Wait,
let
me
put
these
sunglasses
on,
now
look
in
this
mirror
How
'bout
now?
What
do
you
have
in
common?
You're
both
green
with
envy
and
look
like
idiots
with
sunglasses
on
'em
You
look
like
I
sound
like
singing
about
weenies
Now
take
my
weenie
out
of
your
mouth
This
is
between
me
and
you,
I
know
you're
not
happy
I
know
you'd
much
rather
see
me
lying
in
the
corner
of
a
room
somewhere
crying
Curled
up
in
a
ball,
tweaked
out
of
my
mind,
dying,
there's
no
denying
That
my
weenie
is
much
bigger
than
yours
is
Mine
is
like
sticking
a
banana
between
two
oranges
Why
are
you
even
doing
this
to
yourself?
It's
pointless
Why
do
we
have
to
keep
on
going
through
this?
This
is
torturous
My
point
is
this
That
if
you
say
mean
things,
your
weenie
will
shrink
Now
I
forgot
what
the
chorus
is,
you're
just
as...
You're
just
jealous
of
me
'cause
you,
you
just
can't
do
what
I
do
So
instead
of
just
admitting
it,
you
walk
around
and
say
All
kinds
of
really
mean
things
about
me
'Cause
you're
a
meanie,
a
meanie
But
it's
only
'cause
you're
just
really
jealous
of
me
'Cause
I'm
what
you
wanna
be,
so
you
just
look
like
an
idiot
When
you
say
these
mean
things,
'cause
it's
too
easy
to
see
You're
really
just
a
big
weenie,
big
weenie
Fuck
off
my
dick
Ayo
Paul,
it's
Em
I
got
your
call
about
the
Michael
Jackson
thing
And
I
know
that
he's
not
"thrilled"
about
the
video
What,
does
he
wanna
be
startin'
somethin'?
Wow,
well,
I'll
show
him
who's
really
bad
{*burps*}
Paul,
the
way
you
make
me
feel
with
these
calls
You
should
really
take
a
look
at
the
man
in
the
mirror
And
tell
him
to
beat
it,
because
I
won't
stop
'til
I
get
enough
Do
you
remember
the
time
We
were
watching
the
"Billie
Jean"
video?
Well,
he'll
always
be
that
Michael
to
me
And
it
doesn't
matter
if
he's
black
or
white
Because
I
can't
stop
loving
him
And
I
hate
plastic
surgeons,
and
I
hope
they
all
fucking
die
How
do
you
like
that?
And
I
like
him,
I
like
him
a
lot
I
wanna'
touch
him,
but
I
can't
{*mouth
noises*}
Excuse
me,
I'm
taking
a
shit,
sorry
Anyways,
call
me
back
I
have
this
idea
about
how
I
want
to
end
the
show
So,
hit
me
when
you
get
this
message,
fucker
Oh,
and
by
the
way,
no,
I
don't
have
a
new
gun
{*Gun
cracks
and
bullets
fall
out*}
God
damn
it!
Down,
down,
down
Down,
down,
down
Down,

Down,
okay!
Guess
who's
back,

again
Shady's

a
friend
Now
everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
To
the
dance
floor,

the
dance
floor
Now
everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
Alright,
stop…
pajama
time!
Come
here,
little
kiddies!
On
my
lap!
Guess
who's
back
with
a
brand
new
rap?
And
I
don't
mean
"rap"
as
in
a
new
case
Of
child
molestation
accusations
Ah,
ah,
ah,
ah,
ah,
no
worries
Papa's
got
a
brand
new
bag
of
toys
What
else
could
I
possibly
do
to
make
noise?
I
done
touched
on
everything
but
little
boys
And
that's
not
a
stab
at
Michael
That's
just
a
metaphor,
I'm
just
psycho
I
go
a
little
bit
crazy
sometimes
I
get
a
little
bit
out
of
control
with
my
rhymes
Good
God,
dip,
do
a
little
slide
Bend
down,
touch
your
toes,
and
just
glide
Up
the
center
of
the
dance
floor
Like
TP
for
my
bung-hole
And
it's
cool
if
you
let
one
go
Nobody's
gonna
know;
who'd
hear
it?
Give
a
little
"poot
poot,"
it's
okay
(*fart*)
Oops,
my
CD
just
skipped
And
everyone
just
heard

rip
Now,
I'm
gonna
make

It's

Whoops,

Maybe

Every

just
a

Cruisin'
on
the
freeway,

Let

I
don't

where
I'm

all
I

is
When
I
get
there
someone's
gonna
touch
my
body
'Scuse
me,
miss,
I
don't
mean
to
sound
like
a
jerk
But
I'm
feelin'
just
a
little
stressed
out
from
work
Could
you
punch
me
in
the
stomach
and
pull
my
hair
Spit
on
me,
maybe
gouge
my
eyes
out?
(Yeah)
Now,
what's
your
name,
girl?
What's
your
sign?
Man,

up
out
your

Dre

Well,

Tuesday
and
I'm
locked
up
I'm
in
jail
and
I
don't
know
what
happened
They
say
I
was
runnin'
butt-naked
Down
the
street
screamin',
(Ah,

Your

I'm
sorry,
I
don't

All
I

They
said,
"Save

boy,
we
got
you
on
tape
Yellin'
at
an
old
lady
to
touch
my
body!"
Now
this
is
the
part
where
the
rap
breaks
down
It
gets
real
intense,
no
one
makes
a
sound
Everything
looks
like
it's
8
Mile
now
The
beat
comes
back,
and
everybody
lose
themselves
Now
snap
back
to
reality;
look,
it's
B.
Rabbit!
"Yo,

signed
me
up
to
battle?
I'm

grown
man!"

Maybe
next
year
I'll
say,
"ass"
and
she'll
make
my
pee-pee
go
D-doing,
doing,
doing
The
way
she

Sike,
I
joke,
I
joke!
I
kid,
I
kid!
I
don't
think
my
joke
is
working,
I
must
flee
quick
Get
to
the
chopper,
everybody
get
out
I
am
not
Triumph,
I
am
Arnold,
get
down!
The
way
you
shake
it,
I
can't
believe
it
I
ain't
never
seen
an
ass
like
that
The
way
you
move
it,
you
make
my
pee-pee
go
D-doing,
doing,
doing
So
Gwen
Stefani,
will
you
pee-pee
on
me,
please?
I
ain't
never
seen
an
ass
like
that
'Cause
the
way
you
move
it,
you
make
my
pee-pee
go
D-doing,
doing,
doing
Woo!
Fuck
is
wrong
with
you?
Ha!
If
there's
any
bitches
in
this
room
Then
there's
somethin'
I
gotta
say
(Say)
For
all
the
fools
who
fell
for
the
first
Girl
who
comes
their
way
I've
been
down
that
road,
and
now
I'm
back
Sittin'
on
square
one
Tryin'
to
pick
myself
up
Where
I
started
from
I
never
would've
thought
that
I'd
see
you
out
of
control
Even
though
my
penis
was
deep
down
in
your
hole
You
should
know,
between
us,
we
was
like
mates
of
soul
Nothin'
could
intervene
us,
especially
no
hoes
You
was
more
so
the
chalant
type
I
chose
'Til
more
shows,
haunted
you
nights,
I
suppose
That's
how
it
go:
with
time
spent,
emotion
grows
In
the
beginning
friends,
we
decided
to
roll
So
who's
responsible
when
you
get
excited,
explode
And
Obie's
grinnin',
then
you
invite
that
Obie's
cold?
But
bitches,
they
gon'
talk;
niggas,
they
gon'
hate
We
established
this
way
before
we
became
mates
So
what's
required
is
that
you
chill
with
all
that
fire
Get
your
desire
when
I
retire,
and—
Spend
some
time
with
me,
say
that
you'll
be
mine
(Ha-ha)
I
never
thought
I'd
find
someone
to
be
mine
Lord
knows
I
was
right,
‘cause
you
just
crossed
the
line
Spend
some
time
with
me,
say
that
you'll
be
mine
I
used
to
say
I
never
met
a
girl
like
you
before
Still
ain't
got
a
fuckin'
clue
as
to
who
you
truly
are
Almost
went
as
far
as
introducin'
you
to
my
daughters
'Til
you
went
as
far
as
goin'
and
snoopin'
through
my
drawers
Now
I
just
feel
stupid
for
the
loop
that
you
threw
me
for
Can't
believe
I
almost
flew
the
coop
for
some
stupid
whore
You
used
to
say
all
you
wanted
was
for
me
to
be
yours
All
I
ever
wanted
from
you
was
a
few
booty
calls
If
you
recall,
I
used
to
treat
you
like
a
groupie
broad
When
we
fucked,
I
refused
to
even
take
my
jewelry
off
But
it
threw
me
off
the
first
time
I
called
and
you
blew
me
off
It
was
a
shock,
it
struck
me
as
odd,
but
it
turned
me
on
You
started
gettin'
moody
on
me,
pretty
soon
we'd
argue
And
the
ruder
you
got,
the
more
beautiful
you
got
to
me
And
who'da
even
knew
that?
Who
would'a
even
thought
possibly
Cupid
could
shoot
another
one
of
them
Goddamn
darts
at
me?
It's
true
that
I
got
shot
in
the
heart,
but
when
someone
seems
Too
good
to
be
true,
they
usually
are,
but
see
When
you're
in
it,
it's
too
hard
to
see
'Til
you
pull
up
and
see
some
other
dude's
car
parked
and
reach
Up
under
the
seat
as
your
heart
starts
to
beat
Before
you
make
a
decision
that's
life-altering
And
just
as
you
halt
and
you
turn
and
you
start
to
leave
You
hear
them
words
echoing,
almost
haunting,
that
taunting
ring
Spend
some
time
with
me,
say
that
you'll
be
mine
(Ha-ha)
I
never
thought
I'd
find
someone
to
be
mine
Lord
knows
I
was
right,
‘cause
you
just
crossed
the
line
Spend
some
time
with
me,
say
that
you'll
be
mine
(Ha-ha)
Ha,
ha,
yeah
right,
bitch
Spend
some
time
on
my
dick
In
most
cases,
Stat's
attitude
is,
"Fuck
a
bitch!"
(Fuck
a
bitch!)
My
only
motive
is
to
get
head,
and
fuck
a
bitch
(Fuck
a
bitch!)
But
you
was
different,
thought
we
shared
a
covenant
Even
held
your
hand
in
pub-a-lic
We
sufferin'
because
of
this
(Because
of
this)
Shawty
on
some
whole
'nother
other
shit
(Other
shit)
Tryin'
to
play
slick,
thinkin'
I'ma
trick
off
grip
I'll
admit,
I
was
caught
in
the
mix,
down
to
commit
Feedin'
you
the
best
of
me,
I
should've
fed
you
piss
(Should've
fed
you
piss)
We
started
off
closer
than
close
But
who
could've
predicted
to
know
Your
trifling
ways
would'a
stopped
our
growth?
And
the
final
result,
back
in
that
same
boat
I
asked
myself:
"Do
I
love
these
hoes?"
—
Nope!
(Yeah)
Em
introduced
us:
"50,
this
is
Tanya,
Tanya,
this
is
50"
Then
slid
off
and
left
her
to
kick
it
with
me
I
complimented
her,
I
said,
"You
have
very
nice
lips."
With
my
imagination,
I
could
see
her
suckin'
my
dick
We
played
the
phone
game,
a
week
later,
shit
changed
fast
Had
her
comin'
over
in
a
cab
to
give
me
some
ass
Downtown
Manhattan,
on
the
balcony,
stare
at
the
skyline
Penthouse
full
of
imported
shit,
you
know
how
I
grind
She
got
to
talkin',
talkin'
like
an
opportunist,
too
Why
talk,
when
suckin'
my
dick
is
the
real
career
move?
Said
she's
an
aspiring
actress,
she
do
videos
for
practice
Yeah,
yeah,
know
how
many
times
I
done
heard
that
shit?
(Ha-ha!)
Spend
some
time
with
me,
say
that
you'll
be
mine
I
never
thought
I'd
find
someone
to
be
mine
Lord
knows
I
was
right,
‘cause
you
just
crossed
the
line
Spend
some
time
with
me,
say
that
you'll
be
mine
Yeah,
I
know
sometimes
things
may
not
always
make
sense
to
you
right
now.
But
hey,
what'd
Daddy
always
tell
you?
Straighten
up,
little
soldier,
stiffen
up
that
upper
lip!
What
you
cryin'
about?
You
got
me
Hailie,
I
know
you
miss
your
mom,
and
I
know
you
miss
your
dad
When
I'm
gone,
but
I'm
tryin'
to
give
you
the
life
that
I
never
had
I
can
see
you're
sad,
even
when
you
smile,
even
when
you
laugh
I
can
see
it
in
your
eyes,
deep
inside
you
wanna
cry
'Cause
you're
scared,
I
ain't
there
Daddy's
with
you
in
your
prayers
No
more
cryin',
wipe
them
tears
Daddy's
here,
no
more
nightmares
We
gon'
pull
together
through
it
We
gon'
do
it,
Lainie—Uncle's
crazy,
ain't
he?
Yeah,
but
he
loves
you,
girl,
and
you
better
know
it
We're
all
we
got
in
this
world,
when
it
spins,
when
it
swirls
When
it
whirls,
when
it
twirls,
two
little
beautiful
girls
Lookin'
puzzled,
in
a
daze,
I
know
it's
confusin'
you
Daddy's
always
on
the
move,
Momma's
always
on
the
news
I
try
to
keep
you
sheltered
from
it,
but
somehow
it
seems
The
harder
that
I
try
to
do
that,
the
more
it
backfires
on
me
All
the
things
growin'
up
as
Daddy
that
he
had
to
see
Daddy
don't
want
you
to
see,
but
you
see
just
as
much
as
he
did
We
did
not
plan
it
to
be
this
way,
your
mother
and
me
But
things
have
got
so
bad
between
us,
I
don't
see
us
ever
bein'
Together
ever
again,
like
we
used
to
be
when
we
was
teenagers
But
then,
of
course,
everything
always
happens
for
a
reason
I
guess
it
was
never
meant
to
be,
but
it's
just
something
We
have
no
control
over,
and
that's
what
destiny
is
But
no
more
worries,
rest
your
head
and
go
to
sleep
Maybe
one
day
we'll
wake
up
and
this'll
all
just
be
a
dream
Now
hush,
little
baby,
don't
you
cry
Everything's
gonna
be
alright
Stiffen
that
upper
lip
up,
little
lady,
I
told
ya
Daddy's
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
I
know
Mommy's
not
here
right
now,
and
we
don't
know
why
We
fear
how
we
feel
inside
It
may
seem
a
little
crazy,
pretty
baby
But
I
promise,
Momma's
gon'
be
alright
(heh)
It's
funny,
I
remember
back
one
year
when
Daddy
had
no
money
Mommy
wrapped
the
Christmas
presents
up
and
stuck
'em
under
the
tree
And
said
some
of
'em
were
from
me
'cause
Daddy
couldn't
buy
'em
I'll
never
forget
that
Christmas,
I
sat
up
the
whole
night
cryin'
'Cause
Daddy
felt
like
a
bum—see,
Daddy
had
a
job
But
his
job
was
to
keep
the
food
on
the
table
for
you
and
Mom
And
at
the
time,
every
house
that
we
lived
in
Either
kept
gettin'
broken
into
and
robbed
or
shot
up
on
the
block
And
your
mom
was
savin'
money
for
you
in
a
jar
Tryin'
to
start
a
piggy
bank
for
you
so
you
could
go
to
college
Almost
had
a
thousand
dollars,
'til
someone
broke
in
and
stole
it
And
I
know
it
hurt
so
bad
it
broke
your
momma's
heart
And
it
seemed
like
everything
was
just
startin'
to
fall
apart
Mom
and
Dad
was
arguin'
a
lot,
so
Momma
moved
back
On
to
Chalmers
in
the
flat,
one
bedroom
apartment
And
Dad
moved
back
to
the
other
side
of
8
Mile
on
Novara
And
that's
when
Daddy
went
to
California
with
his
CD
And
met
Dr.
Dre
and
flew
you
and
Momma
out
to
see
me
But
Daddy
had
to
work,
you
and
Momma
had
to
leave
me
Then
you
started
seein'
Daddy
on
the
TV,
and
Momma
didn't
like
it
And
you
and
Lainie
were
too
young
to
understand
it
Papa
was
a
rolling
stone,
Momma
developed
a
habit
And
it
all
happened
too
fast
for
either
one
of
us
to
grab
it
I'm
just
sorry
you
were
there
and
had
to
witness
it
first
hand
'Cause
all
I
ever
wanted
to
do
was
just
make
you
proud
Now
I'm
sittin'
in
this
empty
house
Just
reminiscin',
lookin'
at
your
baby
pictures,
it
just
trips
me
out
To
see
how
much
you
both
have
grown,
it's
almost
like
you're
sisters
now
Wow,
guess
you
pretty
much
are,
and
Daddy's
still
here
Lainie,
I'm
talkin'
to
you
too,
Daddy's
still
here
I
like
the
sound
of
that,
yeah,
it's
got
a
ring
to
it,
don't
it?
Sshh!
Momma's
only
gone
for
the
moment
Now
hush,
little
baby,
don't
you
cry
Everything's
gonna
be
alright
Stiffen
that
upper
lip
up,
little
lady,
I
told
ya
Daddy's
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
I
know
Mommy's
not
here
right
now,
and
we
don't
know
why
We
fear
how
we
feel
inside
It
may
seem
a
little
crazy,
pretty
baby
But
I
promise,
Momma's
gon'
be
alright
And
if
you
ask
me
to,
Daddy's
gonna
buy
you
a
mockingbird
I'ma
give
you
the
world
I'ma
buy
a
diamond
ring
for
you,
I'ma
sing
for
you
I'll
do
anything
for
you
to
see
you
smile
And
if
that
mockingbird
don't
sing
and
that
ring
don't
shine
I'ma
break
that
birdie's
neck
I'll
go
back
to
the
jeweler
who
sold
it
to
ya
And
make
him
eat
every
carat,
don't
fuck
with
Dad!
(Ha-ha!)
Tell
myself
that
I
was
doing
alright
There's
nothing
left
to
do
tonight
But
go
crazy
on
you
Crazy
on
you
Let
me
go
crazy,
crazy
on
you
Can't
you
see
what
you
do
to
me,
baby?
You
make
me
crazy,
you
make
me
act
like
a
maniac
I'm
like
a
lunatic,
you
make
me
sick
You're
truly
the
only
one
who
can
do
this
to
me
You
just
make
me
get
so
crazy
I
go
schizo,
I
get
so
insane,
I
just
go
schizophrenic
One
minute
I
wanna
slit
your
throat,
the
next
I
wanna
sex
You
make
me
crazy,
the
way
we
act
Like
two
maniacs
in
the
sack
We
fuck
like
two
jackrabbits
And
maybe
that's
a
bad
habit
'Cause
the
next
day
we're
right
back
at
it
In
the
same
exact
pattern
What
the
fuck
is
the
matter
with
us?
We
can't
figure
out
if
it's
lust
or
it's
love
What's
that
that's
attractin'
us
to
each
other?
They
say
that
every
man
grows
up
to
marry
his
own
mother
Which
would
explain
why
you're
such
a
motherfuckin'
bitch
But
I
stay
and
still
stick
it
out
with
you
Even
though
I
just
hit
you
today
But
you
deserve
it,
you
hit
me
first
and
provoked
me
to
choke
you
Just
'cause
I
came
home
late
last
night
Crawled
in
bed
and
I
woke
you
But
if
there's
one
thing
about
you
that
I
admire
it's,
baby
Because
you
stay
with
me,
maybe
'cause
you're
as
crazy
as
I
am
'Cause
when
I
look
at
you
I
can
see
an
angel
in
your
eyes
But
if
I
look
deeper
inside
I
see
your
freakish
little
side
Like
a
devil
in
disguise,
you're
always
full
of
surprises
Always
pullin'
devices
out
your
purse:
little
vibrators
and
dildoes
You
fucked
yourself
so
much
you
barely
feel
those
anymore
You're
only
twenty-four,
but
you're
plenty
more
ma-ture
Than
those
other
little
hoes
who
just
act
like
little
girls
Like
they're
in
middle
school
still
You're
crazy,
sexy,
cool,
chill
And
you
play
your
position,
you
never
step
outta
line
Even
though
I
stay
in
your
business
you've
always
kept
outta
mine
I
wonder
what's
on
your
mind
Sometimes
they
say
love
is
blind
Maybe
that's
why
the
first
time
I
dotted
your
eye
you
ain't
see
the
sign
Or
maybe
you
did,
maybe
you
like
being
shoved
Maybe
'cause
we're
crazy
in
love
Go
crazy
on
you
Crazy
on
you
Let
me
go
crazy,
crazy
on
you
You
are
the
ink
to
my
paper,
what
my
pen
is
to
my
pad
The
moral,
the
very
fiber,
the
whole
substance
to
my
rap
You
are
my
reason
for
being,
the
meaning
of
my
existence
If
it
wasn't
for
you
I
would
never
be
able
to
spit
this
As
intense
as
I
do,
and
the
irony
is
you
rely
on
me
As
much
as
I
rely
on
you
to
inspire
me
like
you
do
You
provide
me
the
lighter
fluid,
the
fuel
to
my
fire
You're
my
entire
supply:
gas,
the
match,
and
igniter
The
only
way
that
I
am
able
to
stay
so
stable
Is
you're
the
legs
to
my
table
If
you
were
to
break
I'd
fall
on
my
face
But
I'm
always
gonna
make
you
feel
I
don't
need
you
as
much
As
I
really
need
you
so
you
don't
use
it
to
your
advantage
But
you're
essential
to
me,
you're
the
air
I
breathe
I
believe
If
you
ever
leave
me
I'd
probably
have
no
reason
to
be
You
are
the
Kim
to
my
Marshall,
you're
the
Slim
to
my
Shady
The
Dre
to
my
Eminem,
the
Alaina
to
my
Hailie
You
are
the
word
that
I'm
lookin'
for
When
I'm
tryin'
to
describe
how
I
feel
inside
And
the
right
one
just
won't
come
to
my
mind
You're
like
the
pillar
that
props
me
up,
the
beam
that
supports
me
The
bitch
who
never
took
half,
the
wife
who
never
divorced
me
You're
like
the
root
to
my
evil,
you
let
my
devil
come
out
me
You
let
me
beat
the
shit
out
you
before
you
beat
the
shit
out
me
And
no
matter
how
much,
too
much
is
never
enough
Maybe
'cause
we're
crazy
in
love
Go
crazy
on
you
Crazy
on
you
Let
me
go
crazy,
crazy
on
you
*gunshots
and
crowd
hollering*
I
told

motherfuckers

All

Bodies

stops
Everybody

the
door,
somebody's
licking
shots

Security's

I'm
trapped
in
the
club
And
I'm
trying
to
run
and
get
my
motherfucking
gun
(Nigga
what

yo'
wife?)
Nigga,

wife
I'm
trying
to
run
and

my
motherfucking
life
Oh,

The
shooter's
coming
Bitches
hollering,
niggas
running
People,

all
over
the
floor
And
I'm
trying
to
make
it
to
the
Saint
Andrew's
door
(Hey
man)
...That's
the
sound
of
the
Glock
Even
DJ
House
Shoes
fucked
around
and
got
shot
I
done
messed
around,
and

my
TEC
I

but
Fatt
Father
and
Hex
(Kuniva,

alright?)
These
niggas
is
tripping
(Where's
Bizarre
at?)
(I
don't
know,
man)
I'm
trying
to
slip
through
the
exit
and
get
to
where
my
car
is
at
Bitches
screaming
everywhere
and
niggas
is
wylin'
Two
minutes
ago,
we
was
all
joking
and
smiling
This
chick
is
clinging
on
to
me,
sobbing
and
sighing
Saying
she
didn't
mean
to
diss
me
earlier,
and
she
crying
But
it's
real
and
it's
on
and
caps
is
getting
peeled
So
I
hugged
her
and
used
her
body
as
a
human
shield
and
She
got
hit,
and
now
she's
yelling
(Don't
leave
me!)
I
told
her
I'd
be
right
back
and
the
dumb
bitch
believed
me!
I
squeezed
through
the
back
door
and
made
my
escape
I
ran
and
got
my
.38,
I
hope
it's
not
too
late!
One
shot,
two
shot,
three
shots,
four
shots
All

(I

trying
to
call
you
all
day,

I'm
on
7
Mile...what

Damn,

the
back!
(What

With

tire

And
I

I
don't

but
I

It
was
a
black
Mitsubishi
(Shit,

clique

Man!
(I
swear)
And
I
was

Believe

And
I'ma

car
and

One

I
never
seen
no
shit
like
this
in
my
life
before
People
are
still
camped
out
from
the
night
before
Sleeping
outside
the
door,
waiting
in
line
still
Trying
to
get
inside
the
club
to
see
D12
perform
The
fire
marshals
know
the
venue's
too
small
People
are
wall
to
wall,
3,000
and
some
odd
Fans
and
some
cum-wad
from
out
the
parking
lot
Gets
in
an
argument
over
a
parking
spot
Decides
to
pull
his
gun
out
and
lets
a
few
of
them
off
Missed
who
he's
aiming
for,
six
feet
away’s
the
door
Into
St.
Andrew's
Hall,
now
the
strays
flying
all
over
the
place
Grazed
one
bitch
in
the
face
Another
one
of
'em
came
through
the
wall
Before
anyone
could
even
hear
the
first
shot
go
off
I'm
posted
up
at
the
bar,
having
a
Mazel
Tov
Bullet
whizzed
right
by
my
ear,
damn
near
shot
it
off
Thank
God
I'm
alive,
I
gotta
find
Denaun
And
where
the
fuck
is
Von?
He
usually
tucks
one
on
him
Wait
a
minute,
I
think
I
just
saw
Bizarre
Nah,
I
guess
not,
what
the
fuck?
Oh
my
God,
it
was!
I
never
saw
him
run
so
fast
in
my
life
Look
at
him
hauling
ass,
I
think
he
left
his
wife
There
she
is,
on
the
ground,
being
trampled
I
go
to
grab
her
up
by
the
damn
hand,
but
I
can't
pull
her
God
damn,
there
just
went
another
damn
bullet
I'm
hit,
my
vest
is
barely
able
to
handle
it
It's
too
thin,
if
I
get
hit
again,
I
can't
do
it
I
scoop
Dee,
follow
Bizarre's
path,
ran
through
it
and
Made
it
to
the
front
door
and
collapsed
On
the
steps,
looked
up,
and
I
seen
Swift
shooting
it
out
But
I
can't
see
who
he's
shooting
it
out
with
But
Denaun's
right
behind
him,
squeezing
his
four-fifth
One
shot,
two
shot,
three
shots,
four
shots
All
I
hear
is
gunshots,
this
is
where
the
fun
stops
Bodies
drop,
hit
the
floor,
music's
off,
party
stops
Everybody
hit
the
door,
somebody's
licking
shots
off
Yo,
it's
Friday
night,
came
to
this
bitch
right
Big
ass
on
my
left
hand,
Desert
Eagle
in
my
right
I
ain't
come
in
this
bitch
to
party,
I
came
in
this
bitch
to
fight
Although,
I
can't
stay
here
to
fight,
'cause
I'm
popping
niggas
tonight
That's
right,
bitches,
I'm
drunk
with
revenge
Shot
a
bouncer
in
the
neck
for
trying
to
check
when
I
get
in
Swift
told
me
to
meet
him
here,
so
it's
clear
that
the
schmuck
That
shot
out
the
back
of
his
truck
is
up
in
this
motherfucker
So
one
shot
for
the
money,
two
is
to
stop
the
show
The
third's
for
the
bartender
(Bitch,
bring
me
a
bottle
of
Mo')
I
just
wanna
know
who
driving
the
black
Mitsubishi?
He
tried
to
run,
so
Proof
shot
him
in
the
knee
with
a
three-piece
One
shot,
two
shot,
three
shots,
four
shots
All

again
You

But
once

come
back
(Oh!)
Too

We

You

We

Enough

through
the
front
We’ll
come
through
the
side
’Cause
I
don’t
ever
wanna
leave
the
game
Without
at
least
saying
goodbye
So
all
my
people
on
the
left,
all
my
people
on
the
right
Swing
one
last
time
When
Dr.
Dre
says
crunk,
you
will
get
it
crunk
Get
it
crunk!
Crunk!
Crunk!
Crunk!
And
when
50
Cent
says
jump,
you
get
on
one
foot,
and
jump
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
The
buzz
is
tremendous,
we
drop
you
all
to
sense
it
I
don’t
gotta'
promote
it,
for
you
to
know
that
Doc
is
off
the
benches
We
keep
the
party
rockin’
off
the
hinges
We
ain’t
showin’
off,
we
just
going
off
popular
consensus
But
critics
say
that
Doc
is
soft,
Doc
is
talk
Doc
is
all
washed
up,
knock
it
off,
who
the
fuck
is
Doc
impressin’?
Doc
is
this,
Doc
is
that,
you
got
the
wrong
impression
You
must
be
on
the
cock
of
Doc,
’cause
Doc
left
you
all
guessin’
So
DJ
take
the
needle
and
just
drop
it
on
the
record
(What?!)
We
gon’
have
this
motherfucker
hoppin’
in
a
second
(Bump,
bump!)
That’s
why
we
always
save
the
best
cut
last
To
make
you
scratch
and
itch
for
it
like
fresh
cut
grass
’Cause
we
done
swam
with
the
sharks,
wrestled
with
alligators
Spoke
to
a
generation
of
angry
teenagers
Whom
if
it
wasn’t
for
rap
to
bridge
the
gap
may
be
raised
to
be
racist
Who
may
have
never
got
to
see
our
faces
Graced
the
cover
of
Rolling
Stone
pages
Broke
down
barriers
of
language
and
races
Just
call
on
the
caped
crusaders
and
leave
it
to
me
and
Dre
To
pass
the
mic
and
we
can
play
the
Back
and
forth
all
day
like
the
hot
potato
game
That’s
why
we
came
to…
’Cause
we
came
here
to
set
this
party
off
right
Let’s
bounce
tonight
And
if
they
don’t
let
us
in
through
the
front
We’ll
come
through
the
side
’Cause
I
don’t
ever
wanna
leave
the
game
Without
at
least
saying
goodbye
So

my
people

my
people

50
Cent,

Bounce
now,
hands
up,
you
know
how
we
do
We
make
the
club
jump
everywhere
we
go
It’s
no
secret,
everybody
know
When
Dre’s
involved,
there’s
plenty
of
money
involved
And
plenty
honey’s
involved
and
sunny
Sundays
and
palm
trees
Cali,
everyday
is
just
another
party
From
the
valleys
all
the
way
to
them
8
Mile
alleys
Let’s
rally,
hands
up
for
the
grand
finale
Now
raise
up
out
your
seat,
Dre’s
about
to
speak
Blaze
a
pound
of
weed
six
days
up
out
the
week
You
can
catch
me
in
the
studio,
bangin’
out
the
beats
to
Provide
you
with
the
heat
that
keep
blazing
out
your
speakers
So
never
say
never
’cause
Shady,
Aftermath
together
Along
with
G-Unit
Records
presents
the
return
of
the
The
Doc
and
Shady,
no
one
can
do
it
better
We
tear
the
club
up
and
leave
without
a
shred
of
evidence
that
a…
We
came
here
to
set
this
party
off
right
Let’s
bounce
tonight
And
if
they
don’t
let
us
in
through
the
front
We’ll
come
through
the
side
’Cause
I
don’t
ever
wanna
leave
the
game
Without
at
least
saying
goodbye
So

See
you

fuckers!
There's
an
intruder
in
my
house
He
cut
my
phone
line:
can't
dial
out
(Shit!)
I
scream
for
police,
but
I
doubt
They're
gonna
hear
me
when
I
shout
A
couple
of
cocktails'll
send
me
to
jail
There's
a
couple
of
cops
hot
on
my
trail,
but
this
time
When
I
get
pulled
over
there's
a
Doberman
Pinscher
And
a
pit
bull
in
the
seat,
these
pigs'll
get
bit
Foolin'
with
me,
quit
foolin'
with
me
Bitch,
you're
gonna
see,
no
pistol
in
the
seat
Why
it
always
gotta
be
an
issue
when
you're
me?
And
which
you're
gonna
see
in
the
long
run,
I'ma
be
the
wrong
one
You
wanna
harass
with
this
limo-tinted
glass
Flashin'
that
flashlight
on
my
ass
—
where
was
you
at
Last
night
when
them
assholes
ran
up
on
my
grass?
Rapper
slash
actor,
kiss
the
crack
of
my
cracker
slash
ass
They
took
away
my
right
to
bear
arms
What
I'm
'posed
to
fight
with,
bare
palms?
Yeah,
right!
They
comin'
with
bombs
I'm
comin'
with
flare
guns;
we
as
Americans
We
as
Americans,
us
as
a
citizen
Gotta
protect
ourselves,
look
at
how
shit
has
been
We
better
check
ourselves,
livin'
up
in
these
streets
Through
worse
and
through
better
health,
survivin'
by
any
means
We
as
Americans,
us
as
a
citizen
We
are
Samaritans,
what
do
we
get
us
in?
We
better
check
ourselves,
look
at
how
shit
has
been
Take
a
look
where
you
live,
this
is
America
And
we
are
Americans
I
make
beaucoup
bucks,
wearin'
beaucoup
vests
Drama
hangin'
over
my
head,
like
a
voodoo
hex
I
coulda
been
next
to
fly
over
the
cuckoo's
nest
With
you-know-who,
with
an
S
tattooed
to
my
chest
But
I've
finessed
it,
now
I've
got
the
industry
pissy
Ever
since
me
and
Dre
split
it
fifty-fifty
on
50
It's
funny,
we
got
a
buzz
spreadin'
quicker
than
makin'
paper
Airplanes
out
of
a
twenty
—
Fuck
money!
I
don't
rap
for
dead
presidents,
I'd
rather
see
And
the
standards
and
they
can't
stand
it
My
name
shoulda
been
"Bastard",
the
shit
shoulda
been
plastered
On
my
forehead
with
a
stamp,
I
shoulda
been
blasted
I
shoulda
been
had
a
cap
put
in
my
ass
But
I'm
too
swift
and
fast
for
that,
I'm
past
it
I'm
too
old
to
go
and
cruise
Gratiot
—
fuck
that
shit!
I
done
seen
how
fast
this
rap
shit
Can
turn
into
some
pap-pap
shit,
that
quick,
snap
click
But
this
time,
they
got
the
fuckin'
automatic
Ain't
no
one
gon'
test
this
man
—
clack
(*click*)
We
as
Americans,
us
as
a
citizen
Gotta
protect
ourselves,
look
at
how
shit
has
been
We
better
check
ourselves,
livin'
up
in
these
streets
Through
worse
and
through
better
health,
survivin'
by

means
We
as
Americans,
us
as
a

We
are
Samaritans,
what
do
we
get
us
in?
We
better
check
ourselves,
look
at
how
shit
has
been
Take
a
look
where
you
live,
this
is
America
And
we
are
Americans
(Shht!)
I
got
a
secret
if
you
can
keep
it
between
us
I
tuck
two
ninas
under
my
jeans,
either
side
of
my
penis
Under
my
long
johns,
under
my
Sean
Johns
One
run-in
with
the
long
arm
of
the
law,
I'm
long
gone
I'ma
do
five
years
—
no
less
than
that,
no
questions
asked
So
it
might
be
a
good
idea
that
I
stop
right
here
And
quit
while
I'm
ahead,
already
in
the
red
Already
got
a
steady
infrared
meant
for
my
head
A
target
on
my
back,
bigger
problems
than
that
Bin
Laden
on
my
ass,
he
probably
gon'
send
a
task
I
ain't
gon'
even
ask,
they
ain't
gon'
let
me
pack
They
ain't
gon'
give
me
my
semi,
but
I
got
my
weed
back
We
as
Americans,
us
as
a
citizen
Gotta
protect
ourselves,
look
at
how
shit
has
been
We
better
check
ourselves,
livin'
up

Through

through

health,
survivin'
by

We
as

us
as
a

We

what
do
we
get
us
in?
We
better
check
ourselves,
look
at
how
shit
has
been
Take
a
look
where
you
live,
this
is
America
And
we
are
Americans
Still
love
me?
Take
this
You
ready?
One,
two,
three!
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
makin'
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
'Cause
you
love
me,
and
I
love
you
more
It's
sick
but
who
could
ever
predict,
we'd
be
doin'
the
same
shit
We
say
we
do
it
for
our
baby
but
we
don't
We
do
it
for
us,
it's
lust
'cause
neither
one
Of
us
trust
each
other,
so
we
fuck
'til
we
bust
And
we
cuss
each
other
out,
we
know
what
it's
about,
shout
'Til
I
throw
you
out
the
house,
you
throw
me
out
the
house
I
throw
you
on
the
couch,
punch
you
in
the
mouth
Fist
fight
'til
we
turn
this
mother
out
Then
apologize
after,
laughter,
pain
It's
insane,
we're
back
in
the
same
chapter
again
And
it's
sad
but
it's
true,
when
I'm
layin'
here
with
you
There
ain't
nothin'
anyone
could
ever
say
or
ever
do
'cause
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
makin'
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
'Cause
you
love
me,
and
I
love
you
more
'Cause
I
hate
you,
do
you
hate
me?
Good,
'cause
you're
so
fuckin'
beautiful
when
you're
angry
It
makes
me
wanna
just
take
you
and
just
throw
you
On
the
bed
and
fuck
you
like
I
don't
even
know
you
You
fuck
other
people
and
I
fuck
other
people
You're
a
slut,
but
I'm
equal,
I'm
a
mutt,
we're
both
evil
In
our
ways
but
neither
one
of
us
would
ever
admit
it
'Cause
one
us
would
have
one
up
on
the
other
so
forget
it
We
can
make
accusations,
people
spread
rumors
But
they
ain't
got
proof,
'til
they
do
it's
just
the
two
of
us
It's
you
and
me,
'cause
any
chick
can
say
that
she
screwin'
me
But
you
gotta
believe
me
to
a
degree
'cause
true
indeed
If
you
didn't,
I
wouldn't
be
hittin'
—
yeah,
I
would
'Cause
the
sex
is
too
damn
good,
if
I
ran
who
would
I
run
to
That
would
be
this
soft
and
warm?
So
it's
off
and
on,
usually
more
off
than
on
But
at
least
we
know
that
we
share
this
common
bond
You're
the
only
one
I
can
fuck
without
a
condom
on
I
hope,
the
only
reason
that
I
cope
is
'cause
of
that
fact
And
plus
I
can
bust
in
that
and
that's
why
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
makin'
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
'Cause
you
love
me,
and
I
love
you
more
I
can
never
understand
it,
that's
why
I
don't
try
From
junior
high
until
we
both
die,
it's
silly
Oh,
why
must
we
try?
Is
it
really
so
rough
That
we
must
always
call
each
other's
Billy
Goat's
Gruff?
Try
to
pull
each
other's
legs,
until
the
other
begs
We're
lyin'
to
ourselves,
that's
the
beauty
of
it,
yeah!
'Cause
we
truly
love
each
other,
that's
why
we
always
fightin'
All
we
do
is
shove
each
other
every
other
fuckin'
night
And
it's
clear
it
ain't
gonna
change,
it's
pent-up
rage
We
both
had,
we
both
feel
like
we've
been
upstaged
By
someone
else,
we've
both
been
someone
else's
"Someone
else,"
problem
is
neither
one
wants
help
It's
an
addiction
and
it
can't
be
fixed
Our
family's
mixed
up,
there's
a
baby
sister
in
the
mix
And
it
hurts
'cause
the
pieces
to
the
puzzle
don't
fit
And
anybody
who
thinks
they
know
us
doesn't
know
shit
And
they're
probably
just
tired
of
hearin'
it
all
the
time
On
every
song,
every
lyric
and
every
rhyme
All
the
hoopla,
all
of
the
whoopty-woo
What
you
put
me
through,
fuckin'
whoopty-do
But
I
won't
be
made
a
fool
of
if
this
is
true
love
You
wouldn't
do
what
you
did
last
time,
you
wouldn't
screw
up
This
time,
'cause
this
time,
girl,
I'm
tellin'
you
what
You
do
it
again,
I'm
fuckin'
you
up
No
matter
what
you
say,
or
what
you
do
I'ma
hunt
you
down
'til
I
find
you
No
matter
where
you
run,
I'll
be
right
there
Right
behind
you,
in
your
nightmares
So
I
brought
you
the
flowers
and
the
candy
All
the
times
that
you
threw
it
back
at
me
Told
me
you
hate
me,
you
gon'
hate
me
more
When
you
find
out,
you
can't
escape
me,
whore
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
makin'
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
'Cause
you
love
me,
and
I
love
you
more
Once
you
call
my
name
out,
things
will
never
be
the
same
They
should've
never
let
us
get
our
foot
in
this
game
Ever
since
I
was
introduced
to
rap
music
I
been
missing
a
screw
like
Bishop
in
Juice,
I
could
lose
it
At
any
moment,
those
who
know
me
know
it
So
they
probably
told
to
go
with
the
flow
just
so
that
I
don't
explode,
and-
have
another
episode
Where
I
let
it
go
as
far
as
the
one
with
Benzino
did
I'm
waiting
for
that
next
beef,
I'm
cocked,
locked
and
loaded
I'm
ready
to
go
so
bad
I'm
going
bananas,
my
dick's
so
hard
Anna
Nicole
could
use
it
to
fucking
pole
vault
with
Oh
shit!
I
mean
when
she
was
still
bloated
Before
they
cut
her
stomach
open
and
lypo'd
it
(Heheheh!)
Anybody
I
throw
flames
at
gets
a
name
It's
a
game,
'cause
they
know
that
they
don't
spit
the
same
It's
a
shame
what
people
do
for
10
minutes
of
fame
Every
day
it's
the
same
thing,
people
in
this
game
Try
to
buddy-buddy
us
Just
to
get
close
enough
to
study
us,
everybody
just
wants
To
have
something
to
do
with
that
They
all
trying
to
get
that
stamp,
they
after
that
Shady/Aftermath
money
It's
like
a
monopoly
They
probably
just
now
finally
understand
"How
to
Rob"
fully
50
Cent
was
like
a
fucking
jackpot
for
me
And
Dre,
it's
like
we
hit
the
fucking
lottery
And
the
damn
slot
machine
at
the
same
time
as
each
other
Why
the
fuck
you
think
we
ride
like
we
brothers?
When
we
rhyme
with
each
other,
in
time
we
discovered
That
we
had
more
in
common
than
we
thought
with
each
other
Both
robbed
of
our
mothers,
our
fathers
ain't
want
us
What
was
wrong
with
us,
was
it
our
fault?
'Cause
we
started
thinking
God
doesn't
love
us
Two
odd
motherfuckers
who
just
happened
to
meet
at
the
right
time
What
a
coincidence,
'cause
when
50
got
shot
up
in
Jamaica
Queens,
I
still
remember
the
call
up
at
Chung
King
'cause
Big
L
had
just
got
popped
just
a
month
before
If
50
lives
he's
getting
dropped
from
Columbia
Two
years
later,
me
and
Doc
had
to
come,
and,
uhh-
Operate,
that's
when
he
popped
up
at
number
one
And
we
ain't
never
gonna
stop
if
you
wondering,
even
if
I'm
under
the
gun
You
ain't
got
to
agree
all
the
time
with
me
or
see
eye-to-eye
There'll
always
be
animosity
between
you
and
I
But
see
the
difference
is,
if
it
is,
I
could
give
a
shit
I'm
still
gonna
conduct
motherfucking
business
as
usual
Egos
aside
'fore
I
bruise
'em
all
Swallow
your
pride
'fore
I
step
on
it
with
shoes
you
call
Nikes,
Earthlings,
how
do
you
like
these?
You
gotta
love
'em,
look
at
the
bottom
of
'em,
they're
like
cleats
Stomping,
I
been
romping
Since
Tim
Dog
was
hollering
"Fuck
Compton"
I
was
whiling,
freestyling
Back
when
they
were
still
making
Maxell
cassettes
I
wasn't
even
rap's
Elvis
yet,
that
tells
us
that
Any
doubts
in
your
head,
that
seals
the
shit
Ricky
ticky
toc,
ticky
ticky
toc
Still
with
the
Diggy
Diggy
Doc,
Diggy
Diggy
Doc
And
ya'
don't
stop
Welcome
back
to
the
stage
of
history
(Yo,
Slim
Shady!)
Yo,
I'll
fuckin',
I'll...
I'll
puke,
eat
it,
and
freak
you
Battle?
I'm
too
weeded
to
speak
to,
The
only
key
that
I
see
to
defeat
you
Would
be
for
me
to
remove
these
two
Adidas
and
beat
you
And
force
feed
you
'em
both,
and
on
each
feet
is
a
cleat
shoe
I'll
lift
you
off
your
feet
so
fast
with
a
roundhouse
You'll
think
I
pulled
the
fucking
ground
out
from
underneath
you
(Bitch!)
I
ain't
no
fucking
G,
I'm
a
cannibal
I
ain't
tryin'
to
shoot
you,
I'm
tryin'
to
chop
you
into
pieces
and
eat
you
Wrap
you
in
rope
and
plastic,
stab
you
with
broken
glass
And
have
you
with
open
gashes
strapped
to
a
soakin'
mattress
Coke
and
acid,
black
magic,
cloaks
and
daggers
Fuck
the
planet
'til
it
spins
on
a
broken
axis
I'm
so
bananas
I'm
showing
up
to
your
open
casket
To
fill
it
full
of
explosive
gasses
and
close
it
back
With
a
lit
match
in
it
while
I
sit
back
and
just
hope
it
catches
Blow
you
to
fragments,
laugh,
roll
you,
and
smoke
the
ashes
I
see
the
light
at
the
end
But
every
time
I
take
a
step
it
gets
dim
Tell
me,
is
this
Hell
we're
livin'
in?
If
so,
Heaven's
got
to
be
better
But
if
we're
hellbound,
whatever,
let's
go
down
I
see
the
light
at
the
end
But
every
time
I
take
a
step
it
gets
dim
Tell
me,
is
this
Hell
we're
livin'
in?
If
so,
Heaven's
got
to
be
better
But
if
we're
hellbound,
whatever,
let's
go
down
Am
I
the
worst
because
I
never
go
to
church?
I
run
a
red
light
then
sideswipe
a
hearse
I'ma
drink
till
my
liver
rot,
see
the
doc
leave
the
E.R
Then
hit
a
bar
for
a
liquor
shot;
fuck
the
liver
spot!
One
day
we
all
gon'
die
But
when
I
die,
I'ma
be
so
high
That
I'ma
get
up
and
walk,
leaving
the
concrete
bare
With
the
chalk
outline
still
there
I
smoke
'til
I
choke
and
I
sex
a
lot
I
got
a
cross
on
my
chain,
but
it's
just
to
rock
Now
if
I
pray
every
night
Do
I
still
have
to
hold
my
tre
very
tight?
You
feel
me,
God?
I
done
did
so
much
shit
while
on
Earth
I
smoke,
I
drink,
I
curse,
and
to
make
matters
worse
I
bust
my
gun
first,
and
then
I
chat
with
your
corpse
Since
way
back,
I
was
one
to
never
like
back-talk
See
me
at
the
pearly
gates
in
line,
wearing
a
North
Face
Nickle
9
at
my
waist,
God
done
lost
faith
Angels
greet
me,
but
I
don't
reply
back
Just
show
me
to
my
quarters,
and
oh
yeah,
where's
Thai
at?
I
see
the
light
at
the
end
But
every
time
I
take
a
step
it
gets
dim
Tell
me,
is
this
Hell
we're
livin'
in?
If
so,
Heaven's
got
to
be
better
But
if
we're
hellbound,
whatever,
let's
go
down
Maxi
was
seriously
wounded
But
the
soul
still
burns
Final
battle,
fight!
Analyze
the
strength
of
my
game,
like
Lee
Corso
Call
me
a
lost
soul,
with
a
vest
on
my
torso
And
of
course,
yo,
y'all
know
I'm
no
stranger
to
danger
Like
Christ
in
a
manger,
feel
a
whole
range
of
my
anger
I
breathe
down
shit
so
hard
you
can
see
sound
And
beat
down
these
rap
clowns
in
like
three
rounds
My
pen
'bout
as
sharp
as
a
dagger,
walk
with
a
swagger
Tie
your
wife
to
the
back
of
a
black
Jag
and
I
drag
her
Ten
blocks,
untie
the
bitch,
and
I
still
bag
her
Give
her
a
smack
in
the
ass
and
a
six
pack
of
lager
My
shit
go
as
deep
and
as
dark
as
a
train
tunnel
My
flows
spill,
like
using
the
wrong
end
of
a
funnel
Everyday
I
grow
more
older
and
more
colder
Fly
you
to
Colorado,
roll
you
over
with
a
boulder
I
know
you
want
to
retaliate
but
you
won't
dare,
‘cause
you
fucking
with
some
niggas
like
this
who
just
don't
care
I
see
the
light
at
the
end
But
every
time
I
take
a
step
it
gets
dim
Tell
me,
is
this
Hell
we're
livin'
in?
If
so,
Heaven's
got
to
be
better
But
if
we're
hellbound,
whatever,
let's
go
down
Time's
up!
You
lose!
Gotham!
What?
The
Bad!
Yeah
The
Evil!
The
Bad,
the
Evil!
Put
'em
together...
If
it
wasn't
for
your
whip,
I'd
have
nothing
to
strip
If
it
wasn't
for
a
wrist,
I'd
have
nothing
to
slit
If
it
wasn't
for
the
shrooms,
I'd
have
nothing
to
chew
I'm
just
fucking
with
you,
'cause
I
got
nothing
to
do
I
came
in
the
diner
with
skateboarders
and
placed
orders
Ate
hors
d'œuvres
and
hit
the
waiter
with
plate
warmers
Let
you
inhale
the
Glock
smell
while
I'm
ripping
your
wallet
off
And
slipping
a
Molotov
in
your
Cocktail
Burning
your
contracts,
punch
your
A&R
in
the
face
Smash
his
glasses
and
turn
'em
to
contacts
I'm
on
some
Suge
shit,
if
it's
missing
I
took
it
Nurse,
look
at
this
straitjacket;
it's
crooked
I
go
to
jail
and
murder
you
from
a
cell
Put
a
knife
in
an
envelope
and
have
you
stabbed
in
the
mail
(FedEx)
So
how
do
you
describe
someone
with
a
decapitated
head
When
the
rest
of
his
body's
still
alive
running?
Coming
with
five
gunmen,
waiting
to
do
a
drive-by
So
when
you
see
the
black
500,
hide
from
it
For
every
hundred
emcees
rhyming
about
birds
Only
about
two
thirds
really
said
it
without
words
Yo,
you
ain't
a
thug,
I
can
make
you
bitch
up
Pick
the
fifth
up,
cock,
spit,
you
would
swear
it's
raining
slugs
I'm
the
hottest
shit
in
the
industry
I
got
every
thug
on
the
block
that
get
a
wind
of
me,
defending
me
You
lack
class
and
respect,
get
a
direct
backblast
The
Bad
and
Evil
mad
rap,
I
cover
the
Bad
half
You

Now

You

Yo,
if

wasn't
for
your

I'd

nothing
to
strip
And,
if
it
wasn't
for
a
wrist,
I'd
have
nothing
to
slit
If
it
wasn't

I'd
have
nothing

I'm

Forget

It

And
by
the
time
you
all
catch
on,
I'mma
end
your
career
And
walk
away
with
the
whole
floor
so
you

nothing
to
fall
back
on
I'll

Pull

I've

figure
something
in
my
head,
and
maybe
you
can
help
me
out,
yeah?
When
a
person
is
insane,
as
you
clearly
are,
do
you
know
that
you're
insane?
Maybe
you're
just
sitting
around,
reading
Guns

Ammo,
masturbating
in
your
own
feces,
do
you
just
stop
and
go,
"Wow!
It

Some

I'm

I'm

Came

Brain

O'

You

like
George

When
your

turnin'
to
yellowish-orange
mucus
So
when
I
grab
a
pencil
and
squeeze
it
between
fingers
I'm
not
a
rapper,
I'm
a
demon
who
speaks
English
Freak
genius,
too
extreme
for
the
weak
and
squeamish
Burn
you
alive
'til
you

to
be
extinguished
'Cause
when
I
drop
the
science,
motherfuckers
tell
me
to
stop
the

Start
a

and
block
the
hydrants
I'm
just
a

So

You

On
the
B-side
of
my
first

with
the
clean

Stoppin'
your
short
life
while
you're

virgin
Unless
you

a
kidney
specialist
and
a

surgeon
In
the
best
hospital
possible
for
emergency
surgery
To
try
to
stop
the

from
your
ruptured
sternum
internally
I'll
take
it
back
before
we
knew
each
other's

Run
in
a
ultrasound
and
snatch
you
out
your
mother's
frame
I'll
take
it
further
back
than
that,
back
to
lovers'
lane
To
the
night
you
was
thought
up
and
cock-block
your
father's
game
I'll
plead
the
fifth
like
my
jaws
were
muzzled
So
suck
my
dick
while
I
take
a
shit
and
do
this
crossword
puzzle
And
when
I'm
down
with
ten
seconds
left
in
the
whole
bout
I'ma
throw
a
head-butt
so
hard,
I'll
knock
us
both
out
Yo,

Well,
since

'Cause
I
hung
my
original
self
from
the
top
bunk
with
a
belt
Got
pissed
off
and
ripped
Pamela
Lee's
tits
off
And
smacked
her
so
hard
I
knocked
her
clothes
backwards
like
Kris
Kross
I
smoke
a
fat
pound
of
grass,
and
fall
on
my
ass
Faster
than
a
fat
bitch
who
sat
down
too
fast
Come

slut;
"Shady,

(Shh)
Thanks

35
I
smacked
him
in
his
face
with
an
eraser,
chased
him
with
a
stapler
And
stapled
his
nuts
to
a
stack
of
paper
(Ow)
Walked
in
the
strip
club,
had
my
jacket
zipped
up
Flashed
the
bartender,
then
stuck
my

cup

running
over

Make
a
record
about
doin'
drugs
and
name
it
after
her
(Oh,

you)
You
know
you
blew
up
when
the
women
rush
your
stands
And
try
to
touch
your
hands
like
some
screamin'
Usher
fans
(Ahh,
ahh,

This
guy
at
White
Castle
asked
for
my
autograph
(Dude,

your
autograph?)
So
I
signed
it,
"Dear
Dave,
thanks
for
the
support,
asshole"

(Get

Dr.
Dre,
don't
just
stand
there,
operate
I'm
not
ready
to
leave,
it's
too
scary
to
die
(Fuck
that)
I'll
have
to
be
carried
inside
the
cemetery
and
buried
alive
(Huh,
yup)
Am
I
comin'
or
goin'?
I
can
barely
decide
I
just
drank
a
fifth
of
vodka,
dare
me
to
drive?
(Go
ahead)
All
my
life
I
was
very
deprived
I
ain't
had
a
woman
in
years
and
my
palms
are
too
hairy
to
hide
(Whoops)
Clothes
ripped
like
the
Incredible
Hulk
I
spit
when
I
talk,
I'll
fuck
anything
that
walks
(Come
here)
When
I
was
little,
I
used
to
get
so
hungry
I
would
throw
fits
How
you
gonna
breastfeed
me,
Mom?
You
ain't
got
no
tits
I
lay
awake
and
strap
myself
in
the
bed
With
a
bulletproof
vest
on
and
shoot
myself
in
the
head
(Bang)
'Cause
I'm
steamin'
mad
(Grr)
And
by
the
way,
when
you
see
my
dad
(Yeah?)
Tell
him
that
I
slit
his
throat
in
this
dream
I
had

Meet
Eddie,
23
years
old
Fed
up
with
life
and
the
way
things
are
going
(Damn,
I'm
going
fucking
insane)
He
decides
to
rob
a
liquor
store
(I
gotta
take
this
shit,
I
can't
take
it
no
more,
holmes)
But
on
his
way
in,
he
has
a
sudden
change
of
heart
(Shit
is
mine)
And
suddenly
(I
gotta
do
this)
His
conscience
comes
into
play
(I
gotta
do
this)
Alright,
stop
(Huh?)
Now
before
you
walk
in
the
door
of
this
liquor
store
And
try
to
get
money
out
the
drawer
You
better
think
of
the
consequence
(Who
are
you?)
I'm
your
motherfuckin'
conscience
That's
nonsense
Go
in,
gaffle
the
money,
and
run
to
one
of
your
aunt's
cribs
And
borrow
a
damn
dress
and
one
of
her
blond
wigs
(Can
I
borrow
this?)
Tell
her
you
need
a
place
to
stay,
you'll
be
safe
for
days
If
you
shave
your
legs
with
Renee's
razor
blades
Yeah,
but
if
it
all
goes
through
like
it's
supposed
to
The
whole
neighborhood
knows
you
and
they'll
expose
you
Think
about
it
before
you
walk
in
the
door
first
Look
at
the
store
clerk,
she's
older
than
George
Burns
Fuck
that,
do
that
shit,
shoot
that
bitch
Can
you
afford
to
blow
this
shit?
Are
you
that
rich?
Why
you
give
a
fuck
if
she
dies?
Are
you
that
bitch?
Do
you
really
think
she
gives
a
fuck
if
you
have
kids?
Man,
don't
do
it,
it's
not
worth
it
to
risk
it
(You're
right)
Not
over
this
shit
(Stop)
Drop
the
biscuit
(I
will)
Don't
even
listen
to
Slim,
yo,
he's
bad
for
you
You
know
what,
Dre?
I
don't
like
your
attitude
Come
on,
just
come
in
here
for
a
minute
I
don't
know
Look,
look,
look
Damn
Look,
it's
gonna
be
alright,
alright?
O-okay
Look,
give
me
a
kiss,
pull
your
pants
off,
come
on
Meet

After

a
young
girl
at
a
rave
party
Things
start
getting
hot
and
heavy
in
an
upstairs
bedroom
Once
again,
his
conscience
comes
into
play
Now,

to
me,
while
you're

her
cheek
And

Now

is

bitch's
earlobe
Yo,

years

You

advantage
of

it's
not

Yo,

at
her
bush,

(Uh-huh)
Fuck

'Til

a
29-year-old

worker
After

from
a
hard
day's
work
He
walks
in
the
door
of
his
trailer
park
home
To
find
his
wife
in
bed
with
another
man
(What

Grady
Alright,

Fuck

While

Fuck

Wait,

explanation
for
this
shit?
What,
she
tripped,
fell,
landed
on
his
dick?
Tsh,

Shady,

Grady
But

about
the
baby
before

Okay,

Still

Grab

That's

'Cause

Been

Nurse,
we're
losin'
him,
check
the
pulse
A
kid
who
refused
to
respect
adults
Wore
spectacles
with
taped
frames
and
a
freckled
nose
A
corny-lookin'
white
boy,
scrawny
and
always
ornery
'Cause
I
was
always
sick
of
brawny
bullies
pickin'
on
me
And
I
might
snap,
one
day
just
like
that
I
decided
to
strike
back,
and
flatten
every
tire
on
the
bike
rack
My
first
day
in
Junior
High,
this
kid
said
"It's
you
and
I,
three
o'clock
sharp,
this
afternoon
you
die"
I
looked
at
my
watch,
it
was
1:20
"I
already
gave
you
my
lunch
money
What
more
do
you
want
from
me?"
He
said,
"Don't
try
to
run
from
me,
you'll
just
make
it
worse"
My
palms
were
sweaty,
and
I
started
to
shake
at
first
Somethin'
told
me,
"Try
to
fake
a
stomach
ache,
it
works"
I
screamed,
"Ow,
my
appendix
feel
like
they
could
burst
Teacher,
teacher,
quick,
I
need
a
naked
nurse"
"What's
the
matter?"
"I
don't
know,
my
leg,
it
hurts"
"Leg?
I
thought
you
said
it
was
your
tummy"
"Oh,
I
mean
it
is,
but
I
also
got
a
bum
knee"
"Mr.
Mathers,
the
fun
and
games
are
over
And
just
for
that
stunt,
you're
gonna
get
some
extra
homework"
"But
don't
you
wanna
give
me
after
school
detention?"
"Nah,
that
bully
wants
to
beat
your
ass
and
I'ma
let
him"

Brain

Way
before
my
baby
daughter
Hailie
I
was
harassed
daily
by
this
fat
kid
named
DeAngelo
Bailey
An
eighth
grader
who
acted
obnoxious,
'cause
his
father
boxes
So
every
day
he'd
shove
me
in
the
lockers
One
day
he
came
in
the
bathroom
while
I
was
pissin'
And
had
me
in
the
position
to
beat
me
into
submission
He
banged
my
head
against
the
urinal
'til
he
broke
my
nose
Soaked
my
clothes
in
blood,
grabbed
me
and
choked
my
throat
I
tried
to
plead
and
tell
him
we
shouldn't
beef
But
he
just
wouldn't
leave
He
kept
chokin'
me
and
I
couldn't
breathe
He
looked
at
me
and
said,
"You
gonna
die,
honky"
The
principal
walked
in
and
started
helpin'
him
stomp
me
(What's
going
on
in
here?)
I
made
'em
think
they
beat
me
to
death
Holdin'
my
breath
for
like
five
minutes
before
they
finally
left
Then
I
got
up
and
ran
to
the
janitor's
storage
booth
Kicked
the
door
hinge
loose
and
ripped
out
the
four-inch
screws
Grabbed
some
sharp
objects,
brooms
and
foreign
tools
This
is
for
every
time
you
took
my
orange
juice
Or
stole
my
seat
in
the
lunchroom
and
drank
my
chocolate
milk
Every
time
you
tipped
my
tray
and
it
dropped
and
spilt
I'm
gettin'
you
back,
bully,
now
once
and
for
good
I
cocked
the
broomstick
back
and
swung
hard
as
I
could
And
beat
him
over
the
head
with
it
'til
I
broke
the
wood
Knocked
him
down,
stood
on
his
chest
with
one
foot
Made
it
home
later
that
same
day
Started
readin'
a
comic,
and
suddenly
everything
became
gray
I
couldn't
even
see
what
I
was
tryin'
to
read
I
went
deaf
and
my
left
ear
started
to
bleed
My
mother
started
screamin',
"What
are
you
on,
drugs?!
Look
at
you,
you're
gettin'
blood
all
over
my
rug"
(I'm
sorry)
She
beat
me
over
the
head
with
the
remote
control
Opened
a
hole
and
my
whole
brain
fell
out
of
my
skull
I
picked
it
up
and
screamed,
"Look,
bitch,
what
have
you
done?"
"Oh
my
God,
I'm
sorry,
son"
Shut
up,
you
cunt
I
said
fuck
it,
took
it
and
stuck
it
back
up
in
my
head
Then
I
sewed
it
shut
and
put
a
couple
of
screws
in
my
neck

Listen,
I
listened

copy
of
your
album
And,
uh,
y'know,
I've
just
got
to
be
honest
with
you
Can
you
tone
it
down
a
little
bit?
Because
there's
only
so
much

of
your
optical
to
slow
you
down
And
every
time
you
think
you've
gotten
past
it
It's
gonna
come
back
around
to
tackle
you
to
the
damn
ground
What
are
friends?
Friends
are
people
that
you
think
are
your
friends
But
they
really
your
enemies
with
secret
identities
And
disguises
to
hide
they
true
colors
So
just
when
you
think
you
close
enough
to
be
brothers
They
wanna
come
back
and
cut
your
throat
when
you
ain't
lookin'
What
is
money?
Money
is
what
makes
a
man
act
funny
Money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
Money'll
make
them
same
friends
come
back
around
Swearin'
that
they
was
always
down
What
is
life?
I'm
tired
of
life
I'm
tired
of
backstabbin'-ass
snakes
with
friendly
grins
I'm
tired
of
committin'
so
many
sins
Tired
of
always
givin'
in
when
this
bottle
of
Henny
wins
Tired
of
never
havin'
any
ends
Tired
of
havin'
skinny
friends,
hooked
on
crack
and
Mini
Thins
I'm
tired
of
this
DJ
playin'
your
shit
when
he
spins
Tired
of
not
havin'
a
deal
Tired
of
havin'
to
deal
with
the
bullshit
without
grabbin'
the
steel
Tired
of
drownin'
in
my
sorrow
Tired
of
havin'
to
borrow
a
dollar
for
gas
to
start
my
Monte
Carlo
I'm
tired
of
motherfuckers
sprayin'
shit
and
dartin'
off
I'm
tired
of
jobs
startin'
off
At
$5.50
an
hour,
then
this
boss
wonders
why
I'm
smartin'
off
I'm
tired
of
bein'
fired
every
time
I
fart
and
cough
Tired
of
havin'
to
work
as
a
gas
station
clerk
For
this
jerk,
breathin'
down
my
neck,
drivin'
me
berserk
I'm
tired
of
usin'
plastic
silverware
Tired
of
workin'
at
Builder's
Square
Tired
of
not
bein'
a
millionaire
But
if
I
had
a
million
dollars
I'd
buy
a
damn
brewery
and
turn
the
planet
into
alcoholics
If
I
had
a
magic
wand
I'd
make
the
world
suck
my
dick
without
a
condom
on
While
I'm
on
the
john
If
I
had
a
million
bucks,
it
wouldn't
be
enough
Because
I'd
still
be
out
robbin'
armored
trucks
If
I
had
one
wish,
I
would
ask
For
a
big
enough
ass
for
the
whole
world
to
kiss
I'm
tired
of
bein'
white
trash,
broke
and
always
poor
Tired
of
takin'
pop
bottles
back
to
the
party
store
I'm
tired
of
not
havin'
a

Tired
of
not
havin'
a
home
to

Tired

Tired

Tired

without
a
Tylenol
PM
Tired
of
not
performin'
in
a
packed
coliseum
Tired
of
not
bein'
on
tour
Tired
of
fuckin'
the
same
blonde
whore
After
work,
in
the
back
of
a
Contour
I'm
tired
of
fakin'
knots
with
a
stack
of
ones
Havin'
a
lack
of
funds
and
resortin'
back
to
guns
Tired
of
bein'

Tired

damn
Nike
Air
hat
Tired
of
steppin'
in
clubs,
wearin'
the
same
pair
of
Lugz
Tired
of
people
sayin'
they're
tired
of
hearin'
me
rap
about
drugs
Tired
of
other
rappers
who
ain't
bringin'
half
the
skill
as
me
Sayin'
they
wasn't
feelin'
me
on
"Nobody's
As
Ill
As
Me"
And
I'm
tired
of
radio
stations
tellin'
fibs
Tired
of
JLB
sayin',
"Where
hip-hop
lives"
But
if
I
had
a
million
dollars
I'd
buy
a
damn
brewery
and
turn
the
planet

You

what
I'm
sayin'?
I'm
tired
of
all
of
this
bullshit,
tellin'
me
to
be
positive
How
am
I
'posed
to
be
positive
when
I
don't
see
shit
positive?
You
know
what
I'm

I
rap
about
shit
around
me,
shit
I
see
You
know
what
I'm

Right
now,
I'm
tired
of
everything
Tired
of
all
this
player-hatin'
that's
goin'
on
in
my
own
city
Can't
get
no
airplay,
you
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
But
hey,
it's
cool
though,
you
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
I'm
just
fed
up,
that's
my
word
(Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us)
Baby,
your
dada
loves
you
And
I'ma
always
be
here
for
you
(Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us)
No
matter
what
happens
You're
all
I
got
in
this
world
(Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us)
I
would
never
give
you
up
for
nothin'
(Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us)
Nobody
in
this
world
is
ever
gonna
keep
you
from
me
I
love
you
C'mon
Hai-Hai,
we
goin'
to
the
beach
Grab
a
couple
of
toys
and
let
Dada
strap
you
in
the
car
seat
Oh,
where's
Mama?
She's
takin'
a
little
nap
in
the
trunk
Oh,
that
smell?
Dada
must've
runned
over
a
skunk
Now,
I
know
what
you're
thinkin',
it's
kind
of
late
to
go
swimmin'
But
you
know
your
Mama,
she's
one
of
those
type
of
women
That
do
crazy
things,
and
if
she
don't
get
her
way,
she'll
throw
a
fit
Don't
play
with
Dada's
toy
knife,
honey,
let
go
of
it
(No)
And
don't
look
so
upset,
why
you
actin'
bashful?
Don't
you
wanna
help
Dada
build
a
sandcastle?
(Yeah)
And
Mama
said
she
wants
to
show
you
how
far
she
can
float
And
don't
worry
about
that
little
boo-boo
on
her
throat
It's
just
a
little
scratch,
it
don't
hurt
Her
was
eatin'
dinner
while
you
were
sweepin'
And
spilled
ketchup
on
her
shirt
Mama's
messy,
ain't
she?
We'll
let
her
wash
off
in
the
water
And
me
and
you
can
play
by
ourselves,
can't
we?
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
And
when
we
ride
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
Just
you
and
I
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
And
when
we
ride
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
Just
you
and
I
(See,
honey)
There's
a
place
called
Heaven
and
a
place
called
Hell
A
place
called
prison
and
a
place
called
jail
And
Dada's
probably
on
his
way
to
all
of
'em
except
one
'Cause
Mama's
got
a
new
husband
and
a
stepson
And
you
don't
want
a
brother,
do
ya?
(Nah)
Maybe
when
you're
old
enough
To
understand
a
little
better,
I'll
explain
it
to
ya
But
for
now,
we'll
just
say
Mama
was
real,
real
bad
Was
bein'
mean
to
Dad
and
made
him
real,
real
mad
But
I
still
feel
sad
that
I
put
her
on
time
out
Sit
back
in
your
chair,
honey,
quit
tryna
climb
out
I
told
you
it's
okay,
Hai-Hai,
want
a
ba-ba?
Take
a
night-night?
Na-na-boo,
goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her
make
poo-poo
ca-ca?
Dada
change
your
didee
Clean
the
baby
up
so
her
can
take
a
nighty-nighty
Your
dad'll
wake
her
up
as
soon
as
we
get
to
the
water
'97
Bonnie
and
Clyde,
me
and
my
daughter
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
And
when
we
ride
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
Just
you
and
I
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
And
when
we
ride
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
Just
you
and
I
Wake
up,
sweepyhead,
we're
here,
before
we
pway
We're
gonna
take
Mama
for
a
wittle
walk
along
the
pier
Baby,
don't
cry,
honey,
don't
get
the
wrong
idea
Mama's
too
sweepy
to
hear
you
scweamin'
in
her
ear
(Mama)
That's
why
you
can't
get
her
to
wake,
but
don't
worry
Dada
made
a
nice
bed
for
Mommy
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
Here,
you
wanna
help
Dada
tie
a
rope
around
this
rock?
(Yeah)
We'll
tie
it
to
her
footsie
then
we'll
roll
her
off
the
dock
Ready
now,
here
we
go,
on
the
count
of
free
One,

There

Mama,
spashin'
in
the
water
No
more
fightin'
with
Dad,
no

restraining
order
No

step-dada,
no
more
new
brother
Blow
her
kisses
bye-bye,
tell
Mama
you
love
her
(Mommy)
Now
we'll
go
play
in
the
sand,
build
a
castle
and
junk
But
first,
just
help
Dad
with
two
more
things
out
the
trunk
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
And
when
we
ride
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
Just
you
and
I
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
And
when
we
ride
Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us
Just
you
and
I
(Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us)
Just
me
and
you,
baby,
is
all
we
need
in
this
world
(Just
the
two
of
us,
just
the
two
of
us)
Just
me
and
you
Your
dada
will
always
be
here
for
you
Your
dada's
always
gonna
love
you,
remember
that
If
you
ever
need
me,
I'ma
always
be
here
for
you
You
ever
need
anything,
just
ask
Dada
will
be
right
there
Your
dada
loves
you
I
love
you,
baby
Justin?
It's
Zoe
Um,
Kelly
did
not
have
me
call
However,
I
just
listened
to
Eminem
in
her
car
It
is
the
most
disgusting
thing
I
have
ever
heard
in
my
entire
life
And
I
seriously
wanna
call
his
fucking
agent
And
tell
them
how
fucking
disgusting
he
is
It,
like,
makes
me
upset
I'm
now
nauseous
and
I
can't
eat
lunch,
goodbye
Okay,
I'm
going
to
attempt
to
drown
myself
You
can
try
this
at
home
You
can
be
just
like
me
Mic
check,
one-two,
we
recordin'?
I'm
cancerous,
so
when
I
diss,
you
wouldn't
wanna
answer
this
If
you
responded
back
with
a
battle
rap
you
wrote
for
Canibus
I'll
strangle
you
to
death,
then
I'll
choke
you
again
And
break
your
fuckin'
legs
'til
your
bones
poke
through
your
skin
You
beef
with
me,
I'ma
even
the
score
equally
Take
you
on
Jerry
Springer
and
beat
your
ass
legally
I
get
too
blunted
off
of
funny
home
grown
'Cause
when
I
smoke
out,
I
hit
the
trees
harder
than
Sonny
Bono
(Oh
no)
So
if
I
said
I
never
did
drugs
That
would
mean
I
lie
and
get
fucked
more
than
the
President
does
Hilary
Clinton
tried
to
slap
me
and
call
me
a
pervert
I
ripped
her
fuckin'
tonsils
out
and
fed
her
sherbet
(Bitch)
My
nerves
hurt,
and
lately
I'm
on
edge
Grabbed
Vanilla
Ice
and
ripped
out
(C'mere)
his
blond
dreads
(Fuck
you)
Every
girl
I
ever
went
out
with
has
gone
les'
Follow
me
and
do
exactly
what
the
song
says
Smoke
weed,
take
pills,
drop
out
of
school,
kill
people
And
drink,
jump
behind
the
wheel
like
it
was
still
legal
I'm
dumb
enough
to
walk
in
a
store
and
steal
So
I'm
dumb
enough
to
ask
for
a
date
with
Lauryn
Hill
Some
people
only
see
that
I'm
white,
ignorin'
skill
'Cause
I
stand
out
like
a
green
hat
with
a
orange
bill
But
I
don't
get
pissed,
y'all
don't
even
see
through
the
mist
How
the
fuck
can
I
be
white?
I
don't
even
exist
I
get
a
clean
shave,
bathe,
go
to
a
rave
Die
from
an
overdose
and
dig
myself
up
out
of
my
grave
My
middle
finger
won't
go
down,
how
do
I
wave?
And
this
is
how
I'm
supposed
to
teach
kids
how
to
behave?
Now,
follow
me
and
do
exactly
what
you
see
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me?
I
slap
women
and
eat
shrooms,
then
OD
Now,
don't
you
want
to
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me?
Me
and
Marcus
Allen
went
over
to
see
Nicole
When
we
heard
a
knock
at
the
door,
must've
been
Ron
Gold
Jumped
behind
the
door,
put
the
orgy
on
hold
Killed
them
both,
then
smeared
blood
on
the
white
Bronco
(We
did
it)
My
mind
won't
work
if
my
spine
don't
jerk
I
slapped
Garth
Brooks
out
of
his
rhinestone
shirt
I'm
not
a
player,
just
a
ill
rhyme
sayer
That'll
spray
a
aerosol
can
up
at
the
ozone
layer
My
rap
style's
warped,
I'm
runnin'
out
the
morgue
With
your
dead
grandmother's
corpse
to
throw
it
on
your
porch
Jumped
in
a
Chickenhawk
cartoon
with
a
cape
on
And
beat
up
Foghorn
Leghorn
with
an
acorn
I'm
'bout
as
normal
as
Norman
Bates
with
deformative
traits
A
premature
birth
that
was
four
minutes
late
Mother,
are
you
there?
I
love
you
I
never
meant
to
hit
you
over
the
head
with
that
shovel
(That
shovel)
Will
someone
please
explain
to
my
brain
That
I
just
severed
the
main
vein
with
a
chainsaw
and
I'm
in
pain?
I
take
a
breather
and
sigh,
either
I'm
high
or
I'm
nuts
'Cause
if
you
ain't
tiltin'
this
room,
neither
am
I
So
when
you
see
your
mom
with
a
thermometer
shoved
in
her
ass
Then
it
probably
is
obvious
I
got
it
on
with
her
'Cause
when
I
drop
this
solo
shit,
it's
over
with
I
bought
Cage's
tape,
opened
it,
and
dubbed
over
it
I
came
to
the
club
drunk
with
a
fake
ID
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me?
I've
been
with
ten
women
who
got
HIV
Now,
don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me?
I
got
genital
warts
and
it
burns
when
I
pee
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me?
I
tie
a
rope
around
my
penis
and
jump
from
a
tree
You
probably
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me
For
all
the
ladies
out
there
I
never
meant
to
give
you
mushrooms,
girl
I
never
meant
to
bring
you
to
my
world
And
now
you're
lying
in
the

I
went
to
John's
rave
with
Ron
and
Dave
And
met
a
new
wave
blonde
babe
with
half
of
her
head
shaved
A
nurse
aid
who
came
to
get
laid
and
tied
up
With
first
aid
tape
and
raped
on
the
first
date
(Ooh)
Susan,
an
ex-heroin
addict
who
just
stopped
usin'
Who
love
booze
and
alternative
music
(What
up?)
Told
me
she
was
going
back
into
usin'
again
(Nah)
I
said,
"Wait,
first
try
this
hallucinogen
It's
better
than
heroin,
Henn,
the
booze
and
the
gin
C'mere,
let's
go
in
here,
who's
in
the
den?"
"It's
me
and
Kelly!"
"My
bad"
(Sorry)
"Let's
try
another
room"
"I
don't
trust
you"
"Shut
up,
slut,
chew
up
this
mushroom
This'll
help
you
get
in
touch
with
your
roots
We'll
get
barefoot,
butt-naked,
and
run
in
the
woods"
"Oh
hell,
I
might
as
well
try
'em,
this
party
is
so
drab"
"Oh
dag"
(Mmm)
"I
ain't

for
you
to
eat
the
whole
bag"
"Huh?"
I
never

"Oh

"I

(Blehh)
"I

She
said,
"Help

I

I'm
havin'
a

I
said,
"I'm

my
T-shirt
(Let

Would
you
calm
down?
You're

Shit,
I

full-blown
AIDS
and
a

I

a

with
an
orange
robe
I'm
in
the
fourth

autographs
at

I
can't
find
it
I'm

I
spit
'Cause
I
don't

the

(Um,

I
told
the

exchange

I
tried
suicide
once
and
I'll
try
it
again
That's
why
I
write
songs
where
I
die
at
the
end
'Cause
I
don't
give
a
fuck
like
my
middle
finger
was
stuck
And
I
was
wavin'
it
at
everybody,
screamin',
"I
suck"
(I
suck)
I
go
on
stage
in
front
of
a
sell-out
crowd
And
yell
out
loud,
"All
y'all
get
the
hell
out
now"
Fuck
rap,
I'm
givin'
it

y'all,
I'm
sorry
(But
Eminem,
this
is
your
record
release
party)
I'm
bored
out
of
my
gourd,
so
I
took
a
hammer
And
nailed
my
foot
to
the
floorboard
of
my
Ford
Guess
I'm
just
a
sick,
sick
bastard
Who's
one
sandwich
short
of
a
picnic
basket
(I
ain't
got
it
all)
One
Excedrin
tablet
short
of
a
full
medicine
cabinet
I
feel
like
my
head
has
been
shredded
like
lettuce
and
cabbage
(Oh)
And
if
you
ever
see
a
video
for
this
shit
I'll
probably
be
dressed
up
like
a
mummy
with
my
wrists
slit

Got

my
jock
out
in
East
Detroit
'Cause
they
think
that
I'm
a
motherfuckin'
Beastie
Boy
So
I
told
'em
I
was
Mike
D
They
was
like,
"Gee,
I
don't
know,
he
might
be"
I
told
'em,
"Meet
me
at
Kid
Rock's
next
concert"
(Oh
really?)
I'll
be
standin'
by
the
Loch
Ness
Monster"
(Okay)
Peace
out
(Bye)
Then
I
jetted
to
the
weed
house,
smoked
out
'Til
I
started
bustin'
freestyles,
broke
out
Then
I
dipped
quick
back
to
the
crib,
put
on
lipstick
Crushed
up
the
Tylenol
and
ate
it
with
a
dipstick
Made
a
couple
of
crank
calls
collect
(Brrrt)
"It's
Ken
Kaniff
from
Connecticut,
can
you
accept?"
I
want
to
make
songs
all
the
fellas
dub

Ayo,
this
song
is
dedicated
To
all
the
happy
people
All
the
happy
people
who
have
real
nice
lives
And
have
no
idea
what
it's
like
to
be
broke
as
fuck
I
feel
like
I'm
walkin'
a
tight
rope
without
a
circus
net
Poppin'
Percocet,
I'm
a
nervous
wreck
I
deserve
respect
but
I
work
a
sweat
for
this
worthless
check
I'm
'bout
to
burst
this
TEC
at
somebody
to
reverse
this
debt
Minimum
wage
got
my
adrenaline
caged
Full
of
venom
and
rage,
'specially
when
I'm
engaged
And
my
daughter's
down
to
her
last
diaper,
it's
got
my
ass
hyper
I
pray
that
God
answers,
maybe
I'll
ask
nicer
Watchin'
ballers
while
they
flossin'
in
they
Pathfinders
These
overnight
stars
becomin'
autograph-signers
We
all
long
to
blow
up
and
leave
the
past
behind
us
Along
with
the
small
fries
and
average
half-pinters
But
player-haters
turnin'
bitch
like
they
have
vaginas
'Cause
we
see
them
dollar
signs
and
let
the
cash
blind
us
Money'll
brainwash
you
and
leave
yo'
ass
mindless
Them
snakes
slither
in
the
grass,
spineless
That's
rock
bottom,
when
this
life
makes
you
mad
enough
to
kill
That's
rock
bottom,
when
you
want
somethin'
bad
enough
to
steal
That's
rock
bottom,
when
you
feel
like
you've
had
it
up
to
here
'Cause
you
mad
enough
to
scream,
but
you
sad
enough
to
tear
That's

up

here
'Cause
you
mad
enough
to
scream,
but
you
sad
enough
to
tear
My
life
is
full
of
empty
promises
and
broken
dreams
I'm
hopin'
things
look
up,
but
there
ain't
no
job
openings
I
feel
discouraged,
hungry
and
malnourished
Livin'
in
this
house
with
no
furnace,
unfurnished
And
I'm
sick
of
workin'
dead-end
jobs
with
lame
pay
And
I'm
tired
of
bein'
hired
and
fired
the
same
day
But
fuck
it,
if
you
know
the
rules
to
the
game,
play
'Cause
when
we
die,
we
know
we
all
goin'
the
same
way
'Cause
it's
cool
to
be
the
player,
but
it
sucks
to
be
the
fan
When
all
you
need
is
bucks
to
be
the
man,
plus
a
luxury
sedan
Or
comfortable
and
roomy
in
a
6
But
they
threw
me
in
the
mix
with
all
these
gloomy
lunatics
Who
walk
around
depressed,
and
smoke
a
pound
of
cess
a
day
And
yesterday
went
by
so
quick,
it
seems
like
it
was
just
today
My
daughter
wants
to
throw
the
ball,
but
I'm
too
stressed
to
play
Live
half
my
life
and
throw
the
rest
away
That's
rock
bottom,
when
this
life
makes
you
mad
enough
to
kill

There's
people
that
love
me
and
people
that
hate
me
(Yup)
But
it's
the
evil
that
made
me
This
backstabbin',
deceitful
and
shady
(Mhm)
I
want
the
money,
the
women,
the
fortune
and
fame
That
means
I
end
up
burnin'
in
Hell,
scorchin'
in
flame
That
means
I'm
stealin'
your
checkbook
and
forgin'
your
name
This
lifetime
bliss
for
eternal
torture
and
pain
'Cause
right
now,
I
feel
like
I've
just
hit
the
rock
bottom
I've
got
problems,
now
everybody
on
my
block's
got
'em
(Duh)
I'm
screamin'
like
them
two
cops
when
2Pac
shot
'em
Holdin'
two
Glocks,
hope
your
doors
got
new
locks
on
'em
My
daughter's
feet
ain't
got
no
shoes
or
socks
on
'em
And
them
rings
you
wearin'
look
like
they
got
a
few
rocks
on
'em
And
while
you
flaunt
'em
I
could
be
takin'
'em
to
shops
to
pawn
'em
I
got
a
couple
of
rings
and
a
brand-new
watch,
you
want
'em?
'Cause
I
ain't
never
went
gold
off
one
song
I'm
runnin'
up
on
someone's
lawn
with
guns
drawn
That's

Woah,

And

Because

It

the
Dirty

And

he
goes
by
the
name
of,
um,
er-
Slim
Shady,
brain
dead
like
Jim
Brady
I'm
a
M-80,

that
Kim
lady
I'm
buzzin',
Dirty
Dozen,
naughty
rotten
rhymer
Cursin'

Marty
Schottenheimer
You

yo'
style
from
You
ain't
gon'
sell
two
copies
if
you
press
a
double
album
Admit
it,
fuck
it,
while
we
comin'
out
in
the
open
I'm
doin'
acid,
crack,
smack,
coke,
and
smokin'
dope
then
My
name
is
Marshall
Mathers,
I'm
an
alcoholic
(Hi,
Marshall)
I
have
a
disease
and
they
don't
know
what
to
call
it
Better
hide
your
wallet
'cause
I'm
comin'
up
quick
to
strip
yo'
cash
Bought
a
ticket
to
yo'
concert
just
to
come
and
whip
yo'
ass
Bitch,
I'm
comin'
out
swingin'
so
fast
it'll
make
yo'
eyes
spin
You
gettin'
knocked
the
fuck
out
like
Mike
Tyson
(Pssh)
The
proof
is
in
the
puddin',
just
ask
DeShaun
Holton
I'll
slit
yo'
motherfuckin'
throat
worse
than
Ron
Goldman
So
when
you
see
me
on
yo'
block
with
two
Glocks
Screamin',
"Fuck
the
world"
like
2Pac
(I
just
don't
give
a

Talkin'
that
shit
behind
my
back,
dirty
mackin'
Tellin'
your
boys
that
I'm
on
crack
(I
just
don't
give
a

So
put
my
tape
back
on
the
rack,
go
run
and
tell
your
friends
My
shit
is
wack
(I
just
don't
give
a
fuck)
But
see
me
on
the
street
and
duck
'Cause
you
gon'
get
stuck,
stoned,
and
snuffed
('Cause
I
just
don't
give
a
fuck)
I'm
nicer
than
Pete,
but
I'm
on
a
search
to
crush
a
milkbone
I'm
everlastin',
I
melt
vanilla
ice
like
silicone
I'm
ill
enough
to
just
straight
up
diss
you
for
no
reason
I'm
colder
than
snow
season
when
it's
20
below
freezin'
Flavor
with
no
seasoning,
this
is
the
sneak
preview
I'll
diss
yo'
magazine
and
still
won't
get
a
weak
review
I'll
make
yo'
freak
leave
you,
smell
the
Folgers
crystals
This
is
lyrical
combat,
gentlemen,
hold
your
pistols
But
I
form
like
Voltron
and
blast
you
with
my
shoulder
missiles
Slim
Shady,
M&M
was
the
old
initials
(Bye-bye)
Extortion,
snortin',
supportin'
abortion
Pathological
liar,
blowin'
shit
outta
proportion
The
looniest,
zaniest,
spontaneous,
sporadic
Impulsive
thinker,
compulsive
drinker,
addict
Half
animal,
half
man
Dumpin'
yo'
dead
body
inside
of
a
fuckin'
trash
can
With
more
holes
than
an
afghan
So
when
you
see
me
on
yo'
block
with
two
Glocks
Screamin',
"Fuck
the
world"
like
2Pac
(I
just
don't
give

Talkin'
that

behind
my

dirty

Tellin'

So

But

'Cause
you
finna
get
stuck,
stoned,
and
snuffed
('Cause
I
just
don't
give
a

Somebody
let
me
out
this
limousine
(Hey,
let
me
out)
I'm
a
caged
demon
On
stage
screamin'
like
Rage
Against
the
Machine
I'm
convinced
I'm
a
fiend
Shootin'
up
while
this
record
is
spinnin'
Clinically
brain-dead,
I
don't
need
a
second
opinion
Fuck
droppin'
a
jewel,
I'm
flippin'
a
sacred
treasure
I'll
bite
yo'
motherfuckin'
style
just
to
make
it
fresher
I
can't
take
the
pressure,
I'm
sick
of
bitches
Sick
of
naggin'
bosses
bitchin'
while
I'm
washin'
dishes
In
school,
I
never
said
much,
too
busy
havin'
a
head
rush
Doin'
too
much
rush,
had
my
face
flushed
like
red
blush
Then
I
went
to
Jim
Beam,
that's
when
my
face
grayed
Went
to
gym
in
eighth
grade,
*****
the
women's
swim
team
Don't
take
me
for
a
joke,
I'm
no
comedian
Too
many
mental
problems
got
me
snortin'
coke
and
smokin'
weed
again
I'm
goin'
up
over
the
curb,
drivin'
on
the
median
Finally
made
it
home
but
I
don't
got
the
key
to
get
in
So
when
you
see
me
on
yo'
block
with
two
Glocks
Screamin',
"Fuck

D.U
Skylar
Montgomery?
What
do
you
want
from
me,
Roger?
I
know
it
was
you
all
along
messing
around
with
my
dear
Veronica
Wait
a
minute,
you
hold
it
right
there
Me
and
that
woman
love
each
other
Love?
What
do
you
know
of
love?
We
were
destined
to
be
together
I
met
her
on
the
beach
Are
you
out
to
destroy
me?
No,
Roger,
that's
not
what
I
want
to
do
I
love
her,
and
we're
gonna
be
together
Never

Yes,

this

keeps
turning)
As
the

turns
('Round

When

wants
to
test
us
('Round

someone
tries
our
patience
(But
I
wish
it
would
stop
and
let
me
off

I
hang
with
a
bunch
of
hippies
and
wacky
tobacco
planters
Who
swallow
lit
roaches
and
light
up

jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz,

Yo,
they
never
should've
booted
me
outta
reform
school
(Uh-uh)
Deformed
fool,
takin'
a
shit
in
the
warm
pool
'Til
they
threw
me
out
the
Ramada
Inn
I
said,
"It
wasn't
me,
I
got
a
twin"
Oh
my
God,
it's
you,
not
again
(Ahh)
It
all
started
when
my
mother
took
my
bike
away
'Cause
I
murdered
my
guinea
pig
and
stuck
him
in
the
microwave
After
that,
it
was
straight
to
the
40
ouncers
Slappin'
teachers
and
jackin'
off
in
front
of
my

Class

Nessman
Fuck
the
next

I'll
pass
the

guessin'
And
all
the

said,
"Eminem

He'll
never
last,
the
only

Maybe
true,
'til
I
told
this
bitch
in
gym
class
That
she
was
too
fat
to
swim
laps,
she
need
a
Slim
Fast
(Who,

Yeah,
bitch,
you
so
big
You
walked
into
Vic
Tanny's
and
stepped
on
Jenny
Craig
(Well,
I
have
never)
She
picked
me
up
to
snap
me
like
a
skinny
twig
Put
me
in
a
headlock,
then
I
thought
of
my
guinea
pig
(Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait)
I
felt
the
evilness
and
started
transformin'
(Rrrahh)
It
began
stormin',
I
heard
a
bunch
of
cheerin'
fans
swarmin'
Grabbed
that
bitch
by
her
hair,
drug
her
across
the

(Come
here,
bitch)
And
took
her
up
to
the
highest
divin'
board
and
tossed
her
down
Sorry
coach,
it's
too
late
to
tell
me
stop
While
I
drop
this

face
down

watch
her
belly-flop

Day
by

We
drive
around
in
million-dollar

While

(Yo)
Hypochondriac,
hangin'
out
at
the
laundromat
Where
all
the
raunchy,
fat,
white-trashy
blondes
be
at
Dressed
like
a
sailor,
standin'
by
a
pail
of
garbage
It's
almost
dark
and
I'm
still
tryna
nail
a
trailer
park
bitch
I
met
a
slut
and
said,
"What
up?
It's
nice
to
meet
ya"
(Hi)
"I'd
like
to
treat
you
to
a
Faygo
and
a
slice
of
pizza
But
I'm
broke
as
fuck
And
I
don't
get
paid
'til
the
first
of
next
month
(Sorry)
But
if
you'd
care
to
join
me,
I
was
about
to
roll
this
next
blunt
But
I
ain't
got
no
weed,
no
Phillies
or
no
papers
Plus,
I'm
a
rapist
and
a
repeated
prison
escapist
So
give
me
all
your
money
and
don't
try
nothin'
funny
'Cause
you
know
your
stinking
ass
is
too
fat
to
try
to
outrun
me"
I
went
to
grab
my
gun,
that's
when
her
ass
put
it
on
me
(Stop)
With
an
uppercut,
hit
me
with
a
basket
of
laundry
(Ooh)
I
fell
through
the
glass
doors,
started
causin'
a
scene
Slid
across
the
floor
and
flew
right
into
a
washin'
machine
Jumped
up
with
a
broken
back,
thank
God
I
was
smokin'
crack
All
day,
and
doped
up
on
coke
and
smack
All
I
wanted
to
do
was
rape
the
bitch
and
snatch
her
purse
Now
I
wanna
kill
her,
but
yo,
I
gotta
catch
her
first
Ran
through
Rally's
parkin'
lot
and
took
a
shortcut
Saw
the
house
she
ran
up
in
and
shot
her
fuckin'
porch
up
Kicked
the
door
down
to
murder
this
divorced
slut
Looked
around
the
room
That's
when
I
seen
her
bedroom
door
shut
"I
know
you're
in
there,
bitch,
I
got
my
gun
cocked
You
might
as
well
come
out
now"
She
said,
"Come
in,
it's
unlocked"
I
walked
in
and
all
I
smelled
was
Liz
Claiborne
And
seen
her
spread
across
the
bed
naked,
watchin'
gay
porn
She
said,
"Come
here,
big
boy,
let's
get
acquainted"
I
turned
around
to
run,
twisted
my
ankle
and
sprained
it
She
came
at
me
at
full
speed,
nothin'
could
stop
her
I
shot
her
five
times
and
every
bullet
bounced
off
her
I
started
to
beg,
"No,
please
let
go"
But
she
swallowed
my
fuckin'
leg
whole
like
an
egg
roll
With
one
leg
left,
now
I'm
hoppin'
around
crippled
I
grabbed
my
pocket
knife
and
sliced
off
her
right
nipple
Just
tryna
buy
me
some
time,
then
I
remembered
this
magic
trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh,
go-go
gadget
dick
Whipped
that
shit
out,
and
ain't
no
doubt
about
it
It
hit
the
ground,
caused
an
earthquake
and
power
outage
I
shouted,
"Now,
bitch,
let's
see
who
gets
the
best"
Stuffed
that
shit
in,
crooked
and
fucked
that
fat
slut
to
death
Ow,
ow
(Come
here,
bitch)
Ow,
ahh
(Come
here,
take
this
mothafuckin'
dick,
bitch,
come
here)
('Cause
I
don't
know)
And
as
we
go
along
(Why
this
world
keeps
turning)
Throughout
the
days
of
our
lives
('Round
and
'round)
(But
I
wish
it
would
stop
and
let
me
off
right

We
all
face
small
obstacles
(I
don't
know)
And
challenges
everyday
(Why
this
world
keeps
turning)
That
we
must
go
through
('Round

These
are
the
things
That
surround
us
through
our
atmosphere
(But
I
wish
it
would
stop
and
let
me
off
right

(I
don't

Every
day

Every
single
day
the

Keeps
turning

I
wish

let

Keeps
turning
(I
don't
know
why
this
world

Who
came
through
with
two
Glocks
to
terrorize
your
borough?
(Huh?)
Told
you
how
to
slap
dips
and
murder
your
girl?
(I
did)
Gave
you
all
the
finger
and
told
you
to
sit
and
twirl
Sold
a
billion
tapes,
and
still
screamed
"Fuck
the

(I'm
Slim
Shady)
So
come
and
kill
me
while
my
name's
hot
And
shoot
me
25
times
in
the
same
spot
(Ow)
I
think
I
got
a
generation
brainwashed
To
pop
pills
and
smoke
pot
'til
they
brains
rot
Stop
they
blood
flow
'til
they
veins
clot
I
need
a
pain
shot
and
a
shot
of
plain
Scotch
Purple
haze
and
acid
raindrops
Spike
the
punch
at
the
party
and
drink
pop
Shaved
my
armpits
and
wore
a
tank
top
Bad
Boy,
I
told
you
that
I
can't
stop
You
gotta
make
'em
fear
you
'fore

make
'em
feel

So

my
shit
or
I'ma
come
and

you
I
got
mushrooms,
I
got

I
got

tablets
I'm

I'm

I
like
happy
things,
I'm
really
calm
and
peaceful
(Uh-huh)
I
like
birds,
bees,
I
like
people
I
like
funny
things
that
make
me
happy
and
gleeful
Like
when
my
teacher
sucked
my
wee-wee
in
preschool
The
ill
type,
I
stab
myself
with
a
steel
spike
While
I
blow
my
brain
out
just
to
see
what
it
feels
like
'Cause
this
is
how
I
am
in
real
life
(Mhm)
I
don't
want
to
just
die
a
normal
death
I
wanna
be
killed
twice
(Uh-huh)
I
just
wanna
scare
somebody
with
a
gun
threat
When
they
high
off
of
drugs
they
haven't
even
done
yet
So
bring
the
money
by
tonight
'Cause
your
wife
said
this
the
biggest
knife
She
ever
saw
in
her
life
(Help
me,
help
me)
I
try
to
keep
it
positive
and
play
it
cool
Shoot
up
the
playground
and
tell
the
kids
to
stay
in
school
(Stay
in
school)
Cause
I'm
the
one
they
can
relate
to
and
look
up
to
better
Tonight
I
think
I'll
write
my
biggest
fan
a
fuck-you
letter
I
got
mushrooms,
I
got
acid,
I
got

act

I
don't
like
it
(Ahh,
that
shit
is
wack)
Six
months
later,
you'll
hear
your
lyrics
on
my
shit
(That's
my
shit)
People
don't
buy
shit
no
more,
they
just
dub
it
That's
why
I'm
still
broke
and
had
the
number-one
club
hit
(Yup,
uh-huh)
But
they
love
it
when
you
make
your
business
public
So
fuck
it,
I've
got
herpes
while
we
on
the
subject
(Uh-huh)
And
if
I
told
you
I
had
AIDS,
y'all
would
play
it
'Cause
you
stupid
mothafuckas
think
I'm
playin'
when
I
say
it
Well,
I
do
take
pills,
don't
do
speed
Don't
do
crack,
don't
do
coke,
I
do
smoke
weed
(Uh-huh)
Don't
do
smack,
I
do
do
shrooms,
do
drink
beer
(Yup)
I
just
wanna
make
a
few
things
clear
My
baby
mama's
not
dead,
she's
still
alive
and
bitching
And
I
don't
have
herpes,
my
dick's
just
itchin'
It's
not
syphilis,
and
as
for
being
AIDS-infested
I
don't
know

I'm
too
scared

And

I
reckon
you
ain't
familiar
with
these
here
parts
You
know,
there's
a
story
behind
that
there
saloon
20
years
ago,
two
outlaws
took
this
whole
town
over
Sheriffs
couldn't
stop
'em
Quickest
damn
gun-slingers
I've
ever
seen
Got
murdered
in
cold-blood
That
old
saloon
there
was
their
little
home
away
from
home
They
say
the
ghosts
of
Bad
and
Evil
still
live
in
that
tavern
And
on
a
quiet
night,
you
can
still
hear
The
footsteps
of
Slim
Shady
and
Royce
Da
5'9"
I
don't
speak,
I
float
in
the
air,
wrapped
in
a
sheet
I'm
not
a
real
person,
I'm
a
ghost
trapped
in
a
beat
I
translate
when
my
voice
is
read
through
a
seismograph
And
the
noise
is
spread
Picked
up
and
transmitted
through
Royce's
head
(Uhh)
Trap
him
in
his
room,
possess
him
and
hoist
his
bed
'Til
the
evilness
flows
through
his
blood
like
poisonous
lead
Told
him
each
one
of
his
boys
is
dead
(Ohh)
I
asked
him
to
come
to
the
dark
side
He
made
a
choice
and
said
(Yo)
Who
hard?
Yo,
I
done
heard
worse
We
can
get
in
two
cars
and
accelerate

one'll
swerve
first

Dismissal,

track
sliced
without
swords,
I
buried
the
Christ
corpse
In
my
past
life,
when
the
black
knight
mounted
the
white
horse
And
stay
over-worked,
it's
like
the
Nazis
and
the
Nation
Collaboratin',
attemptin'
to
take
over
the
Earth
'Cause
this
is
what
happens
when
Bad
meets
Evil
We
hit
the
trees
'til
we
look
like
Vietnamese
people
He's
Evil,
and
I'm
Bad
like
Steve
Seagal
Above
the
law
'cause
I
don't
agree
with
police
either
Shit,
me
neither
We
ain't
eager
to
be
legal
So
please
leave
me
with
the
keys
to
your
Jeep
Eagle
I
breathe
ether
in
three
lethal
amounts
While
I
stab
myself
in
the
knee
with
a
diseased
needle
(Ahh)
Releasin'
rage
on
anybody
in
squeezin'
range
Cold
enough
to
make
the
seasons
change
into
freezin'
rain
(He's
insane)
No
I'm
not,
I
just
want
to
shoot
up
And
I'm
pissed
off,
'cause
I
can't
find
a
decent
vein
The
disaster
with
dreads,
I'm
bad
enough
to
commit
suicide
And
survive
long
enough
to
kill
my
soul
after
I'm
dead
When
in
danger,
it's
funny,
actually
my
flavor's
similar
to
a
waiter
'Cause
I
serve
any
stranger
with
money
I
spray
a
hundred,
man,
until
they
joint
chains
While
slippin'
bullets
at
point-blank
range
like
they
was
punches
Piss
on
a
flag
and
burn
it,
murder
you
then
come
to
your
funeral
Service
lobby
and
strangle
your
body
to
confirm
it
Whippin'
human
ass,
throwin'
blows,
crackin'
jaws
With
my
fists
wrapped
in
gauze,
dipped
in
glue
and
glass
I'm
blazin'
emcees,
at
the
same
time
amazin'
emcees
Somehow,
emcees
ain't
that
eyebrow-raisin'
to
me
From
all
of
angles
of
us,
flash
a
MAC
loud
enough
To
cast
a
avalanche
and
bust
'til
volcanoes
erupt
Hello?
(Billy?)
Ayo,
what’s
up?
(We're
comin'
to
get
you)
Stop,
they
know
it's
us
I
used
to
be
a
loudmouth,
remember
me?
(Uh-uh)
I'm
the
one
who
burned
your
house
down
(Oh)
Well,
I'm
out
now
(Shit)
And
this
time,
I'm
comin'
back
to
blow
your
house
up
And
I
ain't
gon'
leave
you
with
a
window
to
jump
out
of
Give
me
two
fat
tabs
and
three
shrooms
And
you
won't
see
me,
like
fat
people
in
steam
rooms
And
when
I
go
to
hell
and
I'm
gettin'
ready
to
leave
I'ma
put
air
in
a
bag
and
charge
people
to
breathe
'Cause
this
is
what
happens
when
Bad
meets
Evil
And
we
hit
the
trees
'til
we
look
like
Vietnamese
people
He's
Evil,
and
I'm
Bad
like
Steve
Seagal
Against
peaceful,
see
you
in
Hell
for
the
sequel
(We'll
be
waiting)
See
you
in
Hell
(Uh-huh)
Wall
Street
(Yup),
Royce
Da
5'9",
Slim
Shady
(Uh)
See
you
in
Hell
for
the
sequel
(Bye-bye)
Bad
Meets
Evil,
what?
(Until
next
time)
And
so,
that's
the
story
of
when
Bad
meets
Evil
Two
of
the
most
wanted
individuals
in
the
county
Made
Jesse
James
and
Billy
the
Kid
look
like
law-abiding
citizens
It's
too
bad
they
had
to
go
out
the
way
they
did
Got
shot
in
the
back
comin'
out
of
that
old
saloon
But
their
spirits
still
live
on
'til
this
day
Shh,
wait,
did
y'all
hear
that?
A
lot
of
people
ask
me,
am
I
afraid
of
death?
Hell
yeah,
I'm
afraid
of
death
I
don't
want
to
die
yet
A
lot
of
people
think
that
I
worship
the
Devil
That
I
do
all
types
of
retarded
shit
Look,
I
can't
change
the
way
I
think
And
I
can't
change
the
way
I
am
But
if
I
offended
you,
good
'Cause
I
still
don't
give
a
fuck
I'm
zonin'
off
of
one
joint,
stoppin'
the
limo
Hopped
in
the
window,
shoppin'
a
demo
at
gunpoint
A
lyricist
without
a
clue,
what
year
is
this?
Fuck
a
needle,
here's
a
sword,
body
pierce
with
this
Livin'
amuck,
never
givin'
a
fuck
Give
me
the
keys,
I'm
drunk,
and
I've
never
driven
a
truck
But
I
smoke
dope
in
the
cab
I'll
stab
you
with
the
sharpest
knife
I
can
grab
Come
back
the
next
week
and
re-open
your
scab
(Yeah)
A
killer
instinct
runs
in
the
blood
Emptyin'
full
clips
and
buryin'
guns
in
the
mud
I've
calmed
down
now,
I
was
heavy
once
into
drugs
I
could
walk
around
straight
for
two
months
with
a
buzz
My
brain's
gone,
my
soul's
worn,
my
spirit
is
torn
The
rest
of
my
body's
still
bein'
operated
on
I'm
ducked
the
fuck
down
while
I'm
writin'
this
rhyme
'Cause
I'm
probably
gonna
get
struck
with
lightnin'
this
time
For
all
the
weed
that
I've
smoked,
yo,
this
blunt's
for
you
To
all
the
people
I've
offended,
yeah,
fuck
you
too
To
all
the
friends
I
used
to
have,
I
miss
my
past
But
the
rest
of
you
assholes
can
kiss
my
ass
For
all
the
drugs
that
I've
done,
yo,
I'm
still
gon'
do
To
all
the
people
I've
offended,
yeah,
fuck
you
too
For
every
time
I
reminisce,
yo,
I
miss
my
past
But
I
still
don't
give
a
fuck,
y'all
can
kiss
my
ass
I
walked
into
a
gunfight
with
a
knife
to
kill
you
And
cut
you
so
fast,
when
your
blood
spilled,
it
was
still
blue
I'll
hang
you
'til
you
dangle,
and
chain
you
with
both
ankles
And
pull
you
apart
from
both
angles
I
wanna
crush
your
skull
'til
your
brains
leak
out
of
your
veins
And
bust
open
like
broken
water
mains
So
tell
Saddam
not
to
bother
with
makin'
another
bomb
'Cause
I'm
crushin'
the
whole
world
in
my
palm
Got
your
girl
on
my
arm,
and
I'm
armed
with
a
firearm
So
big
my
entire
arm
is
a
giant
firebomb
Buy
your
mom
a
shirt
with
a
Slim
Shady
iron-on
And
the
pants
to
match
("Here,
Momma,
try
'em
on")
I
get
imaginative
with
a
mouth
full
of
adjectives
A
brain
full
of
adverbs,
and
a
box
full
of
laxatives
(Shittin'
on
rappers)
Causing
hospital
accidents
God
help
me,
before
I
commit
some
irresponsible
acts
again
For
all
the
weed
that
I've
smoked,
yo,
this
blunt's
for
you
To

I
wanted
an
album
so
rugged
nobody
could
touch
it
Spent
a
million
a
track
and
went
over
my
budget
(Oh
shit)
Now,
how
in
the
fuck
am
I
supposed
to
get
out
of
debt?
I
can't
rap
anymore,
I
just
murdered
the
alphabet
Drug
sickness
got
me
doin'
some
bugged
twitches
I'm
withdrawin'
from
crack
so
bad
my
blood
itches
I
don't
rap
to
get
the
women,
fuck
bitches
Give
me
a
fat
slut
that
cooks
and
does
dishes
Never
ran
with
a
clique,
I'm
a
posse
Kamikaze,
strappin'
a
motherfuckin'
bomb
across
me
From
the
second
I
was
born,
my
momma
lost
me
I'm
a
cross
between
Manson,
Esham
and
Ozzy
I
don't
know
why
the
fuck
I'm
here
in
the
first
place
My
worst
day
on
this
Earth
was
my
first
birthday
Retarded?
What
did
that
nurse
say?
Brain
damage?
Fuck,
I
was
born
durin'
an
earthquake
For

Hi,

Do

(Yeah,

Wanna
see
me
stick
nine-inch
nails
through
each
one
of
my
eyelids?
(Uh-huh)
Wanna

(Yeah,

Try
'cid
and

worse

my
life

(Huh?)
My
brain's
dead
weight,
I'm
tryna
get
my
head
straight
But
I
can't
figure
out
which
Spice
Girl
I
want
to
impregnate
(Oh)
And
Dr.
Dre
said,
"Slim
Shady,
you
a
basehead"
(Uh-uh)
"Then
why's
your
face
red?
Man,
you
wasted"
Well,
since
age
12,
I
felt
like
I'm
someone
else
'Cause
I
hung
my
original
self
from
the
top
bunk
with
a
belt
Got
pissed
off
and
ripped
Pamela
Lee's
tits
off
And
smacked
her
so
hard
I
knocked
her
clothes
backwards
like
Kris
Kross
I
smoke
a
fat
pound
of
grass,
and
fall
on
my
ass
Faster
than
a
fat
bitch
who
sat
down
too
fast
Come
here,
slut;
"Shady,
wait
a
minute,
that's
my
girl,
dawg"
I
don't
give
a
fuck,
God
sent
me
to
piss
the
world
off

My
English
teacher
wanted
to
have
sex
with
me
in
junior
high
The
only
problem
was,
my
English
teacher
was
a
guy
I
smacked
him
in
his
face
with
an
eraser,
chased
him
with
a
stapler
Stapled
his
nuts
to
a
stack
of
paper
Walked
in
the
strip
club,
had
my
jacket
zipped
up
Flashed
the
bartender,
then
stuck
my
dick
in
the
tip
cup
Extraterrestrial,
killin'
pedestrians,
rapin'
lesbians
While
they're
screaming,
"Let's
just
be
friends!"
99
percent
of
my
life
I
was
lied
to
I
just
found
out
my
mom
does
more
dope
than
I
do
I
told
her
I'd
grow
up
to
be
a
famous
rapper
Make
a
record
about
doing
drugs
and
name
it
after
her
You
know
you
blew
up
when
the
women
rush
your
stands
And
try
to
touch
your
hands
like
some
screaming
Usher
fans
This
guy
at
White
Castle
asked
for
my
autograph
So
I
signed
it:
"Dear
Dave,
thanks
for
the
support,
asshole!"

Stop
the
tape!
This
kid
needs
to
be
locked
away!
Dr.
Dre,
don't
just
stand
there,
operate!
I'm
not
ready
to
leave,
it's
too
scary
to
die
I'll
have
to
be
carried
inside
the
cemetery
and
buried
alive
Am
I
coming
or
going?
I
can
barely
decide
I
just
drank
a
fifth
of
vodka,
dare
me
to
drive?
All
my
life
I
was
very
deprived
I
ain't
had
a
woman
in
years,
my
palms
too
hairy
to
hide
Clothes
ripped
like
the

I
spit
when
I
talk,
I'll
fuck
anything
that
walks
When
I
was
little
I
used
to
get
so
hungry
I
would
throw
fits
How
you
gonna
breastfeed
me,
Mom?
You
ain't
got
no
tits!
I
lay
awake
and
strap
myself
in
the
bed
Put
a
bulletproof
vest
on
and
shoot
myself
in
the
head
I'm
steaming
mad
and
by
the
way,
when
you
see
my
dad
Tell
him
that
I
slit
his
throat
in
this
dream
I
had
Hi,

1985,
I
arrived
33
years,
damn,
I'm
grateful
I
survived
We
wasn't
s'posed
to
get
past
25
Joke's
on
you
motherfucker,
we
alive
All
these
niggas
popping
now
is
young
Everybody
say
the
music
that
they
make
is
dumb
I
remember
I
was
18
Money,
pussy,
parties,
I
was
on
the
same
thing
You
gotta
give
a
boy
a
chance
to
grow
some
Everybody
talkin'
like
they
know
somethin'
these
days
Niggas
actin'
woke,
but
they
broke,
umm
I
respect
the
struggle
but
you
all
frontin'
these
days
Man,
they
barely
old
enough
to
drive
To
tell
them
what
they
should
do,
who
the
fuck
am
I?
I
heard
one
of
'em
diss
me,
I'm
surprised
I
ain't
trippin',
listen
good
to
my
reply
Come
here
lil'
man,
let
me
talk
with
ya
See
if
I
can
paint
for
you
the
large
picture
Congrats
'cause
you
made
it
out
your
mama's
house
I
hope
you
make
enough
to
buy
your
mom
a
house
I
see
your
watch
icy
and
your
whip
foreign
I
got
some
good
advice,
never
quit
tourin'
'Cause
that's
the
way
we
eat
here
in
this
rap
game
I'm
fuckin'
with
your
funky
lil'
rap
name
I
hear
your
music
and
I
know
that
rap's
changed
A
bunch
of
folks
would
say
that
that's
a
bad
thing
'Cause
everything's
commercial
and
it's
pop
now
Trap
drums
is
the
shit
that's
hot
now
See,
I've
been
on
a
quest
for
the
next
wave
But
never
mind,
that
was
just
a
segue
I
must
say,
by
your
songs
I'm
unimpressed,
hey
But
I
love
to
see
a
Black
man
get
paid
And
plus,
you
havin'
fun
and
I
respect
that
But
have
you
ever
thought
about
your
impact?
These
white
kids
love
that
you
don't
give
a
fuck
'Cause
that's
exactly
what's
expected
when
your
skin
black
They
wanna
see
you
dab,
they
wanna
see
you
pop
a
pill
They
wanna
see
you
tatted
from
your
face
to
your
heels
And
somewhere
deep
down,
fuck
it,
I
gotta
keep
it
real
They
wanna
be
black
and
think
your
song
is
how
it
feels
So
when
you
turn
up,
you
see
them
turnin'
up
too
You
hit
the
next
city,
collect
your
money
when
it's
due
You
gettin'
that
paper,
swimmin'
in
bitches,
I
don't
blame
you
You
ain't
thinkin'
'bout
the
people
that's
lookin'
like
me
and
you
True,
you
got
better
shit
to
do
You
coulda
bought
a
crib
with
all
that
bread
that
you
done
blew
I
know
you
think
this
type
of
revenue
is
never
endin'
But
I
wanna
take
a
minute
just
to
tell
you
that
ain't
true
One
day,
them
kids
that's
listening
gon'
grow
up
And
get
too
old
for
that
shit
that
made
you
blow
up
Now
your
show's
lookin'
light
cause
they
don't
show
up
Which
unfortunately
means
the
money
slow
up
Now
you
scramblin'
and
hopin'
to
get
hot
again
But
you
forgot
you
only
popped
'cause
you
was
ridin'
trends
Now
you
old
news
and
you
goin'
through
regrets
'Cause
you
never
bought
that
house,
but
you
got
a
Benz
And
a
bunch
of
jewels
and
a
bunch
of
shoes
And
a
bunch
of
fake
friends,
I
ain't
judgin'
you
I'm
just
tellin'
you
what's
probably
gon'
happen
when
you
rappin'
'Bout
the
type
of
shit
you
rappin'
'bout
It's
a
faster
route
to
the
bottom
I
wish
you
good
luck
I'm
hoping
for
your
sake
that
you
ain't
dumb
as
you
look
But
if
it's
really
true
what
people
sayin'
And
you
call
yourself
playin'
with
my
name
Then
I
really
know
you
fucked,
trust
I'll
be
around
forever
'cause
my
skills
is
tip-top
To
any
amateur
niggas
that
wanna
get
rocked
Just
remember
what
I
told
you
when
your
shit
flop
In
five
years
you
gon'
be
on

Well,

Old-ass

But

I

Yeah,

Cryin'

‘Cause
I
ain't
into
sorta
kinda,
dissin'
niggas
I'm
borderline
addicted
to
slaughter
Line
up
niggas
in

Of
who
you

Then
I

Ain't

Reminisce

then
it'll
be
If
it's
not,

Ain't

One

One

Somebody
shoulda

this
Be

Somebody

me
it

Yeah,
life
is
a
balance
You
lose
your
grip,
you
can
slip
into
an
abyss
No
doubt,
you
see
these
niggas
trippin'
Ego
in
charge
of
every
move,
he's
a
star
And
we
can't
look
away
due
to
the
days
that
he
caught
our
hearts
He's
fallin'
apart,
but
we
deny
it
Justifying
that
half
ass
shit
he
dropped,
we
always
buy
it
When
he
tell
us
he
a
genius
but
it's
clearer
lately
It's
been
hard
for
him
to
look
into
the
mirror
lately
There
was
a
time
when
this
nigga
was
my
hero,
maybe
That's
the
reason
why
his
fall
from
grace
is
hard
to
take
'Cause
I
believed
him
when
he
said
his
shit
was
purer
and
he
The
type
of
nigga
swear
he
real
but
all
around
him's
fake
The
women,
the
dickriders,
you
know,
the
yes
men
Nobody
with
the
balls
to
say
somethin'
to
contest
him
So
he
grows
out
of
control
Into
the
person
that
he
truly
was
all
along,
it's
startin'
to
show
Damn,
wonder
what
happened
Maybe
it's
my
fault
for
idolizin'
niggas
Based
off
the
words
they
be
rappin'
But
come
to
find
out,
these
niggas
don't
even
write
they
shit
Hear
some
new
style
bubblin'
up,
then
they
bite
this
shit
Damn,
that's
what
I
get
for
lyin'
to
myself
Well,
fuck
it,
what's
more
important
is
he's
cryin'
out
for
help
While
the
world's
eggin'
him
on,
I'm
beggin'
him
to
stop
it
Playin'
his
old
shit,
knowin'
he
won't
top
it

a

and
he
wanna

He
want
the
fame,
the
acclaim,
the
respect
that's
been
had
By
all
the
legends,
so
every

I

him,

stressin'
Talkin'
'bout,

don't

with
him,
this

is

And
I
know
he
so
bitter
he
can't
see
his
own
blessings
Goddamn,
nigga,
you
too
blind
to
see
you
got
fans,
nigga
And
a
platform
to
make
a
classic
rap
song
To
change
a
nigga's
life,
but
you
too
anxious
livin'
life
Always
worried
'bout
the
critics
who
ain't
ever
fuckin'
did
it
I
write
what's
in
my
heart,
don't
give
a
fuck
who
fuckin'
with
it
But
in
a
sense
I
can
relate,
the
need
to
be
great
Turns
into
an
obsession
and
keeps
a
nigga
up
late
Writin'
words,
hopin'
people
observe
the
dedication
That
stirs
in
you
constantly,
but
intentions
get
blurred
Do
I
do
it
for
the
love
of
the
music
or
is
there
more
to
me?
Do
I
want
these
niggas
to
worship
me?

understand
that
they
ain't
even

'Bout
who
they
are
and
why
they
do

Guess
I'm
included
in
that
category
as
a
nigga
who
done

My

I

Songs

from

To
impress
some
niggas

couldn't

Therefore

are
racing
all
the
time
There
is
no
reason
or
no
rhyme
I'm
trapped
inside
myself
A
newborn
baby
has
two
primary
modes
of
communication
Laughter,
which
says,
"I
love
this"
Or
crying,
which
says,
"This
frightens
me,
I'm
in
pain"
Life
can
bring
much
pain
There
are
many
ways
to
deal
with
this
pain
Choose
wisely
At
the
bottom
of
the
hourglass
Lies
sand
that
represents
the
past
In
which
all
of
my
demons
rest
I'm
calling
out
for
help
There
are
many
ways
to
deal
with
this
pain
Choose
wisely
Choose
wisely,
choose
wisely,
choose
wisely,
choose
wisely
Choose
wisely,
choose
wisely,
choose
wisely,
choose
wisely
Choose
wisely,
choose
wisely,
choose
wisely

I
can't

I

vengeance
is
the
Lord's

it's
not

me
I
know
the
punishment
for
you
is
that
you
not

You
place
your
value
on
the
bitches
that
you
got
with
me

now
the
bitches
ask
you
daily

you
not
with
me?"

cut
some

It's
been
a
long
time
since
I
have
felt
this
way
About
something
but
now,
but
now
I'm
controlling
my
mind,
the
days
are
warm
The
nights
are
cold,
the
lost
is
found,
I'm
found
Lord
knows
I
need
something
to
fill
this
void
Lord

I

I

Hell

goddamn

Hell

Bitch,

first
motherfuckin'
million
dollar

Hold

Uncle
Sam

Yup.
Hey,

suck
half
my
dick!
Yeah,
I
pay
taxes,
so
much
taxes,
shit
don't
make
sense
Where
do
my
dollars
go?
You
see
lately,
I
ain't
been
convinced
I
guess
they
say
my
dollars
supposed
to
build
roads
and
schools
But
my
niggas
barely
graduate,
they
ain't
got
the
tools
Maybe
'cause
the
tax
dollars
that
I
make
sure
I
send
Get
spent
hirin'
some
teachers
that
don't
look
like
them
And
the
curriculum
be
tricking
them,
them
dollars
I
spend
Got
us
learning
about
the
heroes
with
the
whitest
of
skin
One
thing
about
the
men
that's
controlling
the
pen
That
write
history,
they
always
seem
to
white-out
they
sins
Maybe
we'll
never
see
a
black
man
in
the
White
House
again
I'll
write
a
check
to
the
IRS,
my
pockets
get
slim
Damn,
do
I
even
have
a
say
'bout
where
it's
goin'?
Some
older
nigga
told
me
to
start
votin'
I
said
"Democracy
is
too
fuckin'
slow"
If
I'm
givin'
y'all
this
hard-earned
bread,
I
wanna
know
Better
yet,
let
me
decide,
bitch,
it's
2018
Let
me
pick
the
things
I'm
funding
from
an
app
on
my
screen
Better
that
than
letting
wack
congressman
I've
never
seen
Dictate
where
my
money
go,
straight
into
the
palms
of
some
Money-hungry
company
that
make
guns
that
circulate
the
country
And
then
wind
up
in
my
hood,
making
bloody
clothes
Stray
bullet
hit
a
young
boy
with
a
snotty
nose
From
the
concrete,
he
was
prolly
rose
Now
his
body
froze
and
nobody
knows
what
to
tell
his
mother
He
did
good
at
the
white
man
schools
unlike
his
brother
Who
was
lost
in
the
streets
all
day,
not
using
rubbers
So
right
now,
he
got
two
on
the
way
Still
sleep
on
covers
in
his
mama
house
She
can't
take
this
shit
no
more,
she
want
him
out
On
the
morning
of
the
funeral,
just
as
she's
walking
out
Wiping
tears
away,
grabbing
her
keys
and
sunglasses
She
remember
that
she
gotta
file
her
taxes,
damn
(Whoa
whoa
whoa
whoa,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah)
(Whoa
whoa
whoa
whoa,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah)
(Whoa
whoa
whoa
whoa,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

(Whoa
whoa
whoa
whoa,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah)
Right,
right,
right,
right
Something's
got
a
hold
on
me
Right,
right,
right,
right
Sometimes
I
think
pain
is
just
a
lack
of
understanding
If
we
could
only
understand
it
all,
would
we
feel
no
pain?
God
must
feel
no
pain
Something's
got
a
hold
on
me
Only
joy
Does
this
mean
even
our
suffering
pleases
him?
Lost
in
a
cloud
of
marijuana
Young
Carolina
nigga,
fish
out
of
water
Step-daddy
just
had
a
daughter
with
another
woman
Mama
ain't
recover
yet
Callin'
me
at
12
at
night
She
drunk
as
fuck
and
I'm
upset
'Cause
why
she
always
using
me
for
crutch?
Growin'
up
I
used
to
always
see
her
up
Late
as
shit,
cigarette
smoke
and
greatest
hits
from
Marvin
Gaye
She
kill
a
whole
bottle
of
some
cheap
chardonnay
I
gotta
leave
this
house
'cause
part
of
me
dies
when
I
see
her
like
this
Too
young
to
deal
with
pain
I'd
rather
run
the
streets
than
see
her
kill
herself
So
'Ville
became
my
escape
from
a
feelin'
I
hate
Mama
cursing
me
out
Depression's
such
a
villainous
state
I
used
to
stay
out
later
on
purpose
Subconsciously
I
was
nervous
that
if
I
came
home
early
then
what
would
surface
was
her
inner
demons
And
then
I'd
have
to
end
up
seein'
my
hero
on
ground
zero
Tears
flow
while
Al
Green
blow
Love
and
happiness
I
wish
that
I
could
say
the
right
words
to
cheer
her
up
I
wish
her
son's
love
was
enough
I
tell
her,
"Mama,
go
to
sleep"
She
tell
me
"Boy,
hush.
You
better
pray
to
God
you
never
get
your
heart
crushed"
I
shake
my
head
in
frustration
Head
to
my
room
and
I
can
still
hear
the
tunes
with
my
door
shut
Fuck
it
though,
a
couple
more
months
I'll
be
gone
Off
to
college
and
dorms
Foolin'
myself,
thinkin'
problems
are
gone
But
now
it's
1
AM
and
my
mama
dialin'
my
phone
I
know
she
intoxicated
and
soon
this
high
that
I'm
on
comes
crashin'
down
She
lit,
talkin'
drunk
shit,
I'm
pissed
But
I'm
still
all
ears
like
Basset
Hounds
Thinkin'
to
myself,
"Maybe
my
mama
need
help
Don't
she
got
work
in
the
morning?
Why
she
do
this
to
herself?
Hate
how
she
slurrin'
her
words
Soundin'
so
fuckin'
absurd
This
ain't
the
woman
I
know,
why
I
just
sit
and
observe?
Why
don't
I
say
how
I
feel?
When
I
do,
she's
defensive
for
real
Well
maybe
things
get
better
with
time,
I
heard
it
heals
Little
did
I
know
how
deep
her
sadness
would
go
Lookin'
back,
I
wish
I
woulda
did
more
instead
of
runnin'
Something's
got
a
hold
on
me
I
can't
let
it
go
Out
of
fear
I
won't
be
free
Something's

a

on

I
can't

won't

No!
Something's

I

Right
Life
can
bring
much
pain
There
are
many
ways
to
deal
with
this
pain
(right)
Choose
wisely

Got
me
down,

Rest
my

my

When

Am

Feels

Don't

This
is

I
should

But
I'm
aggravated

My
saddest
days
are
without

My

addiction
To
my
niggas

I
hope
you
listening

and

This

for
the

Smoking
medical
grade,
but
I
ain't
got
prescription
All
the
way
in
Cali
where
they
ain't
got
precipi-
-tation,
feeling
like
the
only
one
that
made
it
And
I
hate
it
for
my
niggas
'cause
they
ain't
got
ambition
Fuck
did
you
expect,
you
can
blame
it
on
condition
Blame
it
on
crack,
you
can
blame
it
on
the
system
Blame
it
on
the
fact
that
12
got
jurisdiction
To
ride
around
in
neighborhoods
that
they
ain't
ever
lived
in
Blame
it
on
the
strain
that
you
feel
when
daddy
missing
Blame
it
on
Trump
shit,
blame
it
on
Clinton
Blame
it
on
trap
music
and
the
politicians
Or
the
fact
that
every
black
boy
wanna
be
Pippen
But
they
only
got
12
slots
on
the
Pistons
Blame
it
on
the
rain,
Milli
Vanilli
with
the
disk
skip
What
I'm
tryna
say
is
the
blame
can
go
deep
as
seas
Just
to
blame
'em
all
I
would
need
like
twenty
CD's
There's
all
sorts
of
trauma
from
drama
that
children
see
Type
of
shit
that
normally
would
call
for
therapy
But
you
know
just
how
it
go
in
our
community
Keep
that
shit
inside
it
don't
matter
how
hard
it
be
Fast
forward,
them
kids
is
grown
and
they
blowing
trees
And
popping
pills
due
to
chronic
anxiety
I
been
saw
the
problem
but
stay
silent
'cause
I
ain't
Jesus
This
ain't
no
trial
if
you
desire
go
higher
please
But
fuck
that
now
I'm
older
I
love
you
'cause
you
my
friend
Without
the
drugs
I
want
you
be
comfortable
in
your
skin
I
know
you
so
I
know
you
still
keep
a
lot
of
shit
in
You
running
from
yourself
and
you
buying
product
again
I
know
you
say
it
helps
and
no
I'm
not
trying
to
offend
But
I
know
depression
and
drug
addiction
don't
blend
Reality
distorts
and
then
you
get
lost
in
the
wind
And
I
done
seen
the
combo
take
niggas
off
the
deep
end
One
thing
about
your
demons
they
bound
to
catch
up
one
day
I'd
rather
see
you
stand
up
and
face
them
than
run
away
I
understand
this
message
is
not
the
coolest
to
say
But
if
you
down
to
try
it
I
know
of
a
better
way
Meditate
Meditate,
meditate,
meditate,

Don't
medicate,

don't
medicate,
medicate
Meditate,

Don't

Got

soul
When
I

Am

Feels
so
right
to
let
things
go
Don't

One
night
When
me
and
my
mom
was
about
to
go
to
bed
All
the
doors
was
locked
Then
when
I
had
fell
asleep
My
mom
had
heard
three
gun
shots
It
was
to
my
cousin,
his
name
was
Rod
The
one
that
came
to
pick
me
up
He
had
been
shot
right
through
the
face,
right
in
the
neck
And
he
got
shot
right
in
the
stomach
I
put
my
hand
to
the
sky,
I
sing
Grateful
for
the
blessings
you
bring
Thank
you
for
the
ones
I
love
Forgive
me
for
the
times
I
was
Down
and
confused,
I
know
What
I
reap
is
what
I
will
sow
Once
again
I
find
myself
Back
with
you
from
my
hell
All
I
ever
wanted
was
to
hear
them
bitches
holler
back
Get
some
money
plus
respect
and
now
look,
I
got
all
of
that
All
I
wanna
do
is
see
my
granny
on
the
other
side
All
I
wanna
do
is
kill
the
man
that
made
my
momma
cry
All
I
wanna
do
is
touch
a
platinum
plaque
and
celebrate
All
I
wanna
do
is

All
I
wanna
do
is
kill
the
man
that
made
my
momma
cry
Right
now
I'm
starin'
out
the
window
of
my
Range
and
contemplating,
am
I
sane?
Have
I
sacrificed
for
fame?
My
occupation's
on
my
brain
Thought
that
I
could
change
it
all
if
I
had
change
But
the
niggas
that
I
came
up
with
way
back
is
still
the
same
I
be
tryna
give
'em
game
like
Santa
did
when
Christmas
came
They
be
listenin'
but
it's
clear
to
me
they
did
not
hear
a
thing
It
go
in
one
ear
and
out
the
other
like
a
bullet
out
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
shot
by
brothers
standin'
point-blank
range
Niggas
bang
in
the
Ville,
I
always
thought
that
shit
was
strange
How
you
claim
blood
or
cuz
when
that
was
just
a
LA
thing?
I
don't
mean
no
disrespect
towards
your
set,
no,
I'm
just
sayin'
That
it
seem
like
for
acceptance
niggas
will
do
anything
Niggas
will
rep
any
gang,
niggas
will
bust
any
head
Niggas
will
risk
everything,
point
him
out
and
then
he
dead
Shootin'
up
where
his
granny
live,
"blaow,
blaow!",
his
granny
duck
He
don't
give
a
fuck,
he's
on
Henny
and
Xanny'd
up
Blowin'
Tammy
up,
bitch,
when
you
gon'
give
them
panties
up?
He
gon'
plant
a
seed,
but
best
believe
he
ain't
man
enough
Just
because
yo'
dick
can
spray
semen,
it
don't
mean
that
you
ready
to
let
go
of
yo'
childish
ways
The
results
are
deadly
Because
that
child
will
suffer
and
that's
what
can
most
affect
me
The
little
girl
I
met
this
past
summer
said,
"Don't
forget
me"
I
won't
forget
you,
how
could
I
with
all
you
went
through?
A
bullet
hit
yo'
cousin
in
Temple
while
he
was
with
you
And
while
you
was
talkin',
I
was
tearin'
up,
where's
the
tissue?
If
you
was
my
sister
then
I
would
kiss
you
and
tell
you
that
I'm
sorry
for
the
pain
you
had
to
live
through
I
know
I'm
blessed
because
yo'
stress
is
realer
than
anything
I
done
been
through
I
put
my
hand
to
the
sky,
I
sing
Grateful
for
the
blessings
you
bring
Thank
you
for
the
ones
I
love
Forgive
me
for
the
times
I
was
Down
and
confused,
I
know
What
I
reap
is
what
I
will
sow
Once
again
I
find
myself
Back
with
you
from
my
hell
All
I
ever
wanted
was
to
hear
them
bitches
holler
back
Get
some
money
plus
respect
and
now
look,
I
got
all
of
that
All
I
wanna
do
is
see
my
granny
on
the
other
side
All
I
wanna
do
is
kill
the
man
that
made
my
momma
cry
All
I
wanna
do
is
touch
a
platinum
plaque
and
celebrate
All
I
wanna
do
is
keep
my
niggas
out
the
yellow
tape
All
I
wanna
do
is
see
my
granny
on
the
other
side
All
I
wanna
do
is
kill
the
man
that
made
my
momma
cry
It's
not
that
big
Well
at
least,
um
God
had
saved
him
'cause
he
still
alive
So
why
do
y'all
think
that
bad
stuff
happen?
Like
why
can't
the
world
just
be
all
nice
things?
Because
God
is
tryna,
um
Warn-warn
us
or
teach
us
a
lesson
that
we
need
to
learn
Or
He's
tryna
warn
us
of
He's
comin'
back
to,
um,
see
us
and
take
us
home
and
redo
the
world
He's
comin'
back
to,
um,
have
us
be
His
children
and
for
us
to
see
Him
for
the
first
time
so
we
can
rejoice
with
Him
and
have
our
time
And
after
we
do
that,
He's
gonna
restart
the
world
K.O.D
Choose
wisely!
1985,
I
arrived
33
years,
damn,
I'm
grateful
I
survived
We
wasn't
s'posed
to
get
past
25
Joke's
on
you
motherfucker,
we
alive
All
these
niggas
popping
now
is
young
Everybody
say
the
music
that
they
make
is
dumb
I
remember
I
was
18
Money,
pussy,
parties,
I
was
on
the
same
thing
You
gotta
give
a
boy
a
chance
to
grow
some
Everybody
talkin'
like
they
know
somethin'
these
days
Niggas
actin'
woke,
but
they
broke,
umm
I
respect
the
struggle
but
you
all
frontin'
these
days
Man,
they
barely
old
enough
to
drive
To
tell
them
what
they
should
do,
who
the
fuck
am
I?
I
heard
one
of
'em
diss
me,
I'm
surprised
I
ain't
trippin',
listen
good
to
my
reply
Come
here
lil'
man,
let
me
talk
with
ya
See
if
I
can
paint
for
you
the
large
picture
Congrats
'cause
you
made
it
out
your
mama's
house
I
hope
you
make
enough
to
buy
your
mom
a
house
I
see
your
watch
icy
and
your
whip
foreign
I
got
some
good
advice,
never
quit
tourin'
'Cause
that's
the
way
we
eat
here
in
this
rap
game
I'm
fuckin'
with
your
funky
lil'
rap
name
I
hear
your
music
and
I
know
that
rap's
changed
A
bunch
of
folks
would
say
that
that's
a
bad
thing
'Cause
everything's
commercial
and
it's
pop
now
Trap
drums
is
the
shit
that's
hot
now
See,
I've
been
on
a
quest
for
the
next
wave
But
never
mind,
that
was
just
a
segue
I
must
say,
by
your
songs
I'm
unimpressed,
hey
But
I
love
to
see
a
Black
man
get
paid
And
plus,
you
havin'
fun
and
I
respect
that
But
have
you
ever
thought
about
your
impact?
These
white
kids
love
that
you
don't
give
a
fuck
'Cause
that's
exactly
what's
expected
when
your
skin
black
They
wanna
see
you
dab,
they
wanna
see
you
pop
a
pill
They
wanna
see
you
tatted
from
your
face
to
your
heels
And
somewhere
deep
down,
fuck
it,
I
gotta
keep
it
real
They
wanna
be
black
and
think
your
song
is
how
it
feels
So
when
you
turn
up,
you
see
them
turnin'
up
too
You
hit
the
next
city,
collect
your
money
when
it's
due
You
gettin'
that
paper,
swimmin'
in
bitches,
I
don't
blame
you
You
ain't
thinkin'
'bout
the
people
that's
lookin'
like
me
and
you
True,
you
got
better
shit
to
do
You
coulda
bought
a
crib
with
all
that
bread
that
you
done
blew
I
know
you
think
this
type
of
revenue
is
never
endin'
But
I
wanna
take
a
minute
just
to
tell
you
that
ain't
true
One
day,
them
kids
that's
listening
gon'
grow
up
And
get
too
old
for
that
shit
that
made
you
blow
up
Now
your
show's
lookin'
light
cause
they
don't
show
up
Which
unfortunately
means
the
money
slow
up
Now
you
scramblin'
and
hopin'
to
get
hot
again
But
you
forgot
you
only
popped
'cause
you
was
ridin'
trends
Now
you
old
news
and
you
goin'
through
regrets
'Cause
you
never
bought
that
house,
but
you
got
a
Benz
And
a
bunch
of
jewels
and
a
bunch
of
shoes
And
a
bunch
of
fake
friends,
I
ain't
judgin'
you
I'm
just
tellin'
you
what's
probably
gon'
happen
when
you
rappin'
'Bout
the
type
of
shit
you
rappin'
'bout
It's
a
faster
route
to
the
bottom
I
wish
you
good
luck
I'm
hoping
for
your
sake
that
you
ain't
dumb
as
you
look
But
if
it's
really
true
what
people
sayin'
And
you
call
yourself
playin'
with
my
name
Then
I
really
know
you
fucked,
trust
I'll
be
around
forever
'cause
my
skills
is
tip-top
To
any
amateur
niggas
that
wanna
get
rocked
Just
remember
what
I
told
you
when
your
shit
flop
In
five
years
you
gon'
be
on
Love

Hip-Hop,
nigga
I
see
the,
I
see
the—
I
see
the,
I
see
the—
I
see
the
rain
Pouring

Before

Should

I
see
the,
I
see
the
rain
Pouring
down,
uh
Before
my
very
eyes
Should
come
as
no
surprise
I'm
searching
and
praying
and
hoping
for
something
I
know
I'm
gon'
see
it,
I
know
that
it's
coming
Lord,
huh
Lord,
huh
But
what
do
you
do
when
there's
no
place
to
turn?
I
have
no
one,
I'm
lonely,
my
bridges
have
burnt
down
Lord
Lord
The
bells
getting
loud,
ain't
nowhere
to
hide
Got
nowhere
to
go,
put
away
my
pride
Tired
of
feeling
low
even
when
I'm
high
Ain't
no
way
to
live,
do
I
wanna
die?
I
don't
know,
I
don't

Bells
getting

ain't

Got

Bells
gettin'
louder,

I
see
the
rain
Pouring
down
Awwwww...haha
Now
I
was
barely
seventeen
with
a
pocket
full
of
hope
Screamin'
"dollar
and
a
dream"
with
my
closet
lookin'
broke
And
my
nigga's
lookin'
clean,
gettin'
caught
up
with
that
dope
Have
you
ever
served
a
fiend
with
a
pocket
full
of
soap?
Nigga
I
can
tell
you
things
that
you
probably
shouldn't
know
Have
you
ever
heard
the
screams
when
the
body
hit
the
floor?
Flashbacks

the
pain,
wakin'
up,
cold
sweats
Six

in
the
mornin',
gotta

Get

watch
for
the

God
they
love
to
serve
a
nigga
three
hots

Nowadays
crime
pays
like
a
part
time
job
And
the
drought
got
me
prayin'
for
a
Carl
Thom

Summer
Rain

Numb
the
pain
'cause
it's
hard
for
a
felon
In
my
mind
I
been
cryin',
know
it's
wrong
but
I'm
sellin'
Eyes

'Cause
you
wanna
change
the
world,
but
while
alive
you
never
will
'Cause
they
only
feel
you
after
you
gone,
or
I've
been
told
And
now
I'm
caught
between
bein'
heard
and
gettin'
old
Damn,
death
creepin'
in
my
thoughts
lately
My
one
wish
in
this
bitch,
"Make
it
quick
if
the
Lord
take
me"
I
know
nobody
meant
to
live
forever
anyway
And
so
I
hustle
like
my
niggas
in
Virgini-A
They
tellin'
niggas,
"sell
dope,
rap
or
go
to
NBA"
In
that
order,
it's
that
sort
of
thinkin'
That
been
keepin'
niggas
chained
at
the
bottom
and
hanged
The
strangest
fruit
that
you
ever
seen,
ripe
with
pain,
listen...
Huh,

Sometimes
you
worry
'bout
the
things
he
can
provide
for
ya
Whenever
you
around
I
seem
to
come
alive
for
ya
I
finally
recognize
the
feelings
that's
inside
for
ya
Although
I
know
your
man
and
trust
me
he
would
die
for
ya
These
quiet
thoughts
of
you
been
going
on
for
years
now
I
saw
you
in
the
party,
soft
lips,
soft
spoken
I
came
and
talked
to
you
but
homie
interfered
now
He
introduced
you
as
his
girl
and
I
was
heartbroken
Some
people
talk
about
that
love
at
first
sight
shit
To
keep
it
real
I
don't
know
whether
I
believe
it's
true
But
if
it
is
then
tell
me
if
I'm
wrong
or
right
If
I
fell
in
love
with
you
before
I
ever
even
knew
I
catch
your
eye
then
look
away
as
if
it
never
happened
At
times
I
feel
as
though
I'm
caught
up
in
a
strange
dream
If
eyes
could
talk
then
mines
would
tell
ya
that
I'm
feeling
you
Sometimes
I
swear
your
eyes
be
telling
me
the
same
thing
She

small
town

Stop

Better

cause
you

cut
the
lights
on
And
put
my
number
in
it—
I'm
staring
at
you
from
afar,
I'm
wondering
'bout
you
Like,
where
you
from
and
who
you
are?
'Cause
you
a
star—no,
not
the
type
that
snort
the
white
lines
I
mean
the
type
to
light
the
night
time,
I
heard
you
got
a
man
But
who
in
their
right
mind
letting
you
out
the
house
alone?
Tell
me
is
your
house
a
home?
Why
you
in
the
club
looking
like
you
out
your
zone?
Now
be
discreet
and
pull
out
your
phone
and
put
my
number
in
it
Text
a
nigga
when
your
man
leave
you
unattended
On
a
scale
from
1
to
10
that
girl's
a
hundred
and
I
want
it
No
question,
I
know
destiny
well
And
though
I
sin
the
Lord
blessing
me
still
Every
saint
got
a
past,
every
sinner
got
a
future
Every
loser
gotta
win
and
every
winner
gotta
lose
someday
They
say
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
And
if
I
had
my
way
then
you
would
be
mine
She

My
dad,
he
died—he
got
shot
'cause
his
friend
set
him
up.
And
I
didn't
go
to
his
funeral—and
sometimes
when
I'm
in
my
room,
I
get
mad
at
my
momma
when
she
mean
to
me.
And
she—
And
she
say,
"clean
up"—I
say—

I

mad
and
I
slam
my

my
room—
And
then,
I
get
mad
and
I
say,

I've
fallen
in
love
for
the
first
time
I
wanna
cry
And
I
ain't
even
tryna
fight
it
Don't
wanna
die
(Don't
wanna
die
no
more)
'Cause
now
you're
here
and
I
just
wanna
be
Right
by
your
side
On
any
night
that
you
be
crying,
baby
I'll
dry
your
eyes
I'll
dry
your
eyes
Every
time
you
go
to
sleep
you
look
like
you
in
Heaven
Plus
the
head
game
is
stronger
than
a
few
Excedrin
You
shine
just
like
the
patent
leather
on
my
new
11's
You
read
me
like
a
book
like
I'm
the
Bible,
you
the
Reverend
Yeah,
I
wanna
tell
the
truth
to
you
I
wanna
talk
about
my
days
as
a
youth
to
you
Exposing
you
to
all
my
demons
and
the
reasons
I'm
this
way
I
would
like
to
paint
a
picture,
but
it'll
take
more
than
a
day
It
would
take
more
than
some
years
to
get
all
over
all
my
fears
Preventing
me
from
letting
you
see
all
of
me
perfectly
clear
The
same
wall
that's
stopping
me
from
letting
go
and
shedding
tears
From
the
lack
of
having
father,
and
the
passing
of
my
peers
While
I'm
too
scared
to
expose
myself
It
turns
out,
you
know
me
better
than
I
know
myself
Better
than
I
know
myself
Well
how
'bout
that?
She
gets
him
(you
get
me)
She
hugs
him
(you
kiss
me)
You
tell
me
you
miss
me
And
I
believe
you,
I
believe
you
She
gets
him
(you
get
me)
She
hugs
him
(you
kiss
me)
You
tell
me
you
miss
me
And
I
believe
you,
I
believe
you
Catch
me,
don't
you—
Catch
me,
don't
you
catch
me
I've
fallen
in
love
for
the
first
time
My
intuition
is
telling
me
there'll
be
better
days,
yeah
My
intuition
is
telling
me
there'll
be
better
days
I
like
this
tone
Yeah,
my
intuition
is
telling
me
there'll
be
better
days
I
sit
in
silence
and
find
whenever
I
meditate
My
fears
alleviate,
my
tears
evaporate
My
faith
don't
deviate,
ideas
don't
have
a
date
But
see
I'm
growing
and
getting
stronger
with
every
breath
Bringing
me
closer
to
Heaven's
doors
with
every
step
As
we
speak
I'm
at
peace,
no
longer
scared
to
die
Most
niggas
don't
believe
in
God
and
so
they
terrified
It's
either
that
or
they
be
fearing
they
gon'
go
to
Hell
Asking
the
Father
for
forgiveness,
got
'em
overwhelmed
(Please,
God,
I
want
to
go
to
Heaven)
As
if
He's
spiteful
like
them
white
folks
that
control
the
jail
See
I
believe
if
God
is
real,
He'd
never
judge
a
man
Because
He
knows
us
all
and
therefore
He
would
understand
The
ignorance
that
make
a
nigga
take
his
brother
life
The
bitterness
and
pain
that
got
him
beating
on
his
wife
I
know
you
desperate
for
a
change
let
the
pen
glide
But
the
only
real
change
come
from
inside
(Come

But
the

real
change

(Come

But
the
only
real
change
come
from—
In
cemeteries
or
in
chains
I
see
men
cry
But
the
only
real
change
come
from
inside
(Come

But
the

(Come

But
the

real
change
come
from—
Yeah,
my
chosen
religion
Jesus
piece
frozen
from
sinnin'
Doin'
dirt,
hoping
to
God,
He
know
my
intentions
To
see
a
million
'fore
I
see
a
casket
I
got
a
baby
on
the
way,
know
he
gon'
be
a
bastard
I'm
living
fast
like
I'm
in
a
drag
race,
how
that
cash
taste
When
I
was
a
senior,
I
was
ballin'
on
my
classmates
Niggas
put
three
bullets
in
my
car,
one
hit
the
gas
tank
Know
I
got
a
angel
cause
I'm
supposed
to
have
a
halo
Right
now,
my
lifestyle
destined
for
a
federal
facility
For
my
ability
to
make
them
birds
fly
Fiends
wanna
get
higher
than
a
bird's
eye
view
And
who
am
I
to
tell
a
nigga
what
to
do?
I
just
supply,
it's
economics
My
business
ain't
got
the
suit
and
tie
Keep
a
pistol
at
all
times,
niggas
want
what's
mine
I
can't
oblige,
dog,
I
work
too
hard
So
reach
for
it,
get
referred
to
God,
I'm
going
hard,
nigga

only
real
change
come
from—
Yeah,
prodigal
son,
got
a
new
gun
This
one
don't
run
out
of
ammo
Lately
been
working
on
my
handles
Can
I
ball,
become
a
star
and
remain
my
self?
If
I
fall,
dust
it
off
and
regain
my
self
Fuck
'em
all,
they
don't
know
all
the
pain
I
felt
I'm
in
awe,
after
all
the
fame
I
felt,
I
evolved
I
no
longer
bury
demons,
I
be
a
vessel
for
the
truth
until
I'm
barely
breathing,
I'm
singing
Life
is
all
about
the
evolution
I
give
up,
I
give
in,
I
move
back
a
little
I
live
up,
I
look
up,
now
I'm
back
for
more
You
can
dream
but
don't
neglect
the
execution
I
give
up,
I
give
in,
I
move
back
a
little
I
live
up,
I
look
up,
now
I'm
back
for
more
Time
is
short
that's
what
somebody
told
me
I
give
up,
I
give
in,
I
move
back
a
little
I
live
up,
I
look
up,
now
I'm
back
for
more
Too
short
to
keep
following
your
homies
I
give
up,
I
give
in,
I
move
back
a
little
I
live
up,
I
look
up,
now
I'm
back
for
more
I
reminisce
back
to
a
time
where
niggas
threw
they
hands
All
of
a
sudden
niggas
pop
a
trunk
and
then
we
scram
Finger
on
trigger
make
a
little
nigga
understand
What
it's
like
to
finally
be
the
motherfuckin'
man
Eyes
wide
that's
from
the
power
that
the
coward
feels
Niggas
die
over
bitches,
disrespect,
and
dollar
bills
Bloodshed
that
turned
the
city
to
a
battlefield
I
call
it
poison,
you
call
it
real
(pop,
pop,
pop,
pop)
That's
how
you
feel?
Pistols
be
poppin'
and
niggas
drop
in
a
heartbeat
Scattered
like
roaches,
a
body
laid
on
the
concrete
A
body
laid
on
the
concrete
Look,
somebody
laid
on
the
concrete
No
time
for
that,
ain't
no
lookin'
back,
cause
I'm
running
too
I
made
it
home,
I
woke
up
and
turned
on
the
morning
news
Overcame
with
a
feeling
I
can't
explain
Cause
that
was
my
nigga
James
that
was
slain,
he
was
22
(Last
night
at
around...)
He
was
22
(22
year
old
black
male,
suspect,
reporting
live...)
(I
swear
to
God,
bruh)
We're
gathered
here
today...
(I
swear
to
God)
To
mourn
the
life
of
James
McMillan
Jr
(I
swear
to
God—nigga,
I'ma
kill
them
niggas,
man)
A
tragedy,
another
tragedy
in
the
black
community
(I
promise
you,
bro...)
We
got
to
do
better,
people
22
years
old,
this
boy
was
too
young
(I
promise
you,
bro,
I'ma
kill
them
niggas,
yo...)
Our
condolences
go
to
his
family,
our
prayers
(I'ma
kill
them
niggas
myself...)
We
know
he's
in
a
better
place
We
know
he's
in
a
better
place
But
this
has
got
to
end,
ladies
and
gentleman
We've
got
to
come
together,
this
is—this
is
beyond
words
Now
I'd
like
to
open
this
ceremony
with
a
verse
from—
I
guess
the
neighbors
think
I'm
sellin'
dope,
sellin'
dope
Sellin'
dope,
sellin'
dope,
sellin'
dope
Yeah,
I
don't
want
no
picture
with
the
president
I
just
wanna
talk
to
the
man
Speak
for
the
boys
in
the
bando
And
my
nigga
never
walkin'
again
Apologize
if
I'm
harpin'
again
I
know
these
things
happen
often
But
I'm
back
on
the
scene
I
was
lost
in
a
dream
As
I
write
this,
the
team
down
in
Austin
I
been
buildin'
me
a
house
Back
home
in
the
South,
ma
Won't
believe
what
it's
costin'
And
it's
fit
for
a
king,
right?
Or
a
nigga
that
could
sing
And
explain
all
the
pain
that
it
cost
him
My
sixteen
should've
came
with
a
coffin
Fuck
the
fame
and
the
fortune
Well,
maybe
not
the
fortune
But
one
thing
is
for
sure
though
The
fame
is
exhaustin'
That's
why
I
moved
away,
I
needed
privacy
Surrounded
by
the
trees
and
Ivy
League
Students
that's
recruited
highly
Thinkin'
"You
do
you
and
I
do
me"
Crib
has
got
a
big
'ol
back
'ol
yard
My
niggas
stand
outside
and
pass
cigars
Filled
with
marijuana,
laughin'
hard
Thankful
that
they
friend's
a
platinum
star
In
the
driveway
there's
no
rapper
cars
Just
some
shit
to
get
from
back
and
forth
Just
some
shit
to
get
from
back
and

Welcome
to
the
Sheltuh,
this
is
pure
We'll
help
you
if
you've
felt
too
insecure
To
be
the
star
you
always
knew
you
were
Wait,
I
think
police
is
at
the
door
Okay,

neighbors
think
I'm
sellin'
dope
Hm,

Well,

Some
things
you
can't
escape:
Death,
taxes,
and
a
ra-
-cist
society
that
make
Every
nigga
feel
like
a
candidate
For
a
Trayvon
kinda
fate
Even
when
your
crib
sit
on
a
lake
Even
when
your
plaques
hang
on
a
wall
Even
when
the
president
jam
your
tape
Took
a
little
break
just
to
annotate
How
I
feel,
damn,
it's
late
I
can't
sleep
cause
I'm
paranoid
Black
in
a
white
man
territory
Cops
bust
in
with
the
army
guns
No
evidence
of
the
harm
we
done
Just
a
couple
neighbors
that
assume
we
slang
Only
time

on
the

chains,

Woke
up
this
morning
Feeling
like
the
best
version
of
me,
so
happy
I
walked
in
the
living
room
And
saw
you
all
alone
on
the
couch,
just
napping
I,
I
see
a
lot
on
your
plate
Nine
months
with
that
weight
I
know
you
tired
so
I
wonder
how
I
can
help
I
get
the

the

Oh,

Listen,
this
is
a
meditation
for
me
A
practice
in
being
present
There's
nowhere
I
need
to
be
Except
right
here
with
you
Except
right
here
with

Folding

Catching

Eating

Raisin
Bran
in
my
bowl
With
bananas
and
some
almond
milk
I
never

I'd

the
day
I'm

I

The
way

mine
Save
you
some
time
Alleviate
a
bit
of
stress
from
your
mind
Help
you
relax
Let
you
recline
babe
Then
I
should
do
it
'Cause
Heaven
only
knows
How
much
you
have
done
that
for
me
Now
I
see
It's
the
simple
things
It's
the

Niggas
from
the
hood
is
the
best
actors
We
the
ones
that
got
to
wear
our
face
backwards
Put
your
frown
on
before
they
think
you
soft
Never
smile
long
or
take
your
defense
off
Acting
tough
so
much,
we
start
to
feel
hard
Live
from
the
city
where
they
pull
cards
I
got
a
Glock
40
and
a
little
nine
Ready
for
the
day
a
nigga

mine
Niggas
from
the
hood
is
the
best
actors
Gotta
learn
to
speak
in
ways
that's
unnatural
Just
to
make
it
through
the
job
interviews
If
my
niggas
heard
me,
they'd
say
"Damn,
what's
gotten
into
you?"
Just
trying
to
make
it,
dog,
somehow
Peeking
through
the
blinds,
I
see
the
sun
now
I
see
you're
still
sleeping
and
it
feels
like
Maybe
everything
is
gon'
be
alright
Catch
me,
don't
you
Catch
me,
don't
you
Catch
me,
I've
fallen
in
love
for
the
first
time
For
you
I
drop
the
tough
guy
shit,
on
this
bus
I
sit
Thinking
'bout
you,

Thinking

Needin'
me,
wantin'
me,
givin'
me
a
chance
to
feel
special
To
somebody
in
a
world
where
they
not
lovin'
me
Handcuffs
keep
huggin'
the,
wrists
of
my
niggas
And
I
wish
stuff
was
different
here
But
if
I
had
a
magic
wand
to
make
the
evil
disappear
That
means
that
there
would
be
no
Santa
Claus
no
more
To
bring
you
Christmas
cheer
'Cause
what
he
represents
is
really
greed
And
the
need
to
purchase
shit
from
corporations
That
make
a
killin'
because
they
feed
On
the
wallets
of
the
poor
who
be
knockin'
on
they
door
Every
Black
Friday
just
to
get
some
shit
they
can't
afford
Even
with
the
discount,
write
a
check,
that
shit
bounce
But
as
long
as
we
got
credit,
it
don't
matter,
the
amount
We
just
swipin'
shit
here,
we
don't
love,
we
just
likin'
shit
here
What's
that
smell?
Where's
your
diaper
shit
here?
Lay
on
your
back,
don't
pee
right
now
Or
else
I'll
have
to
get
you
back
One
day
when
you
gon'
want
to
get
your
way
Yeah
I'll
have
fun
with
that
Reminisce
when
you
came
out
the
womb
Tears
of
joy
I
think
filled
up
the
room
You
are
now
the
reason
that
I
fight
I
ain't
never
did
nothing
this
right
in
my
whole
life
Got
me
thinking...
Am
I
worthy
of
this
gift?
Am
I
strong
enough
to
lift?
(Am
I
strong
enough
to
lift?)
Into
a
place
that
I
can
see
(Into
a
place
that
I
can

Someone
more
important
than
me?
(Someone

for
the
first
time
I
wanna
cry,
and
I
ain't
even
tryna
fight

Don't
wanna
die,
'cause
now
you're
here
And
I
just
wanna
be
right
by
your
side
On
any
night
that
you
be
cryin',
baby
I
dry
your
eyes,
I
dry
your
eyes
There
is
a
God,
it
is
a
God
Yeah,
it
is
a
God
I
never
felt
so
alive
I
never
felt

Catch

Catch
me,
don't
you—
Catch

I've
fallen
in
love
for
the
first
time
Yeah
(For
your
eyes)
For
your

(For

For
your

For

Hey,
niggas
be
dying
on
the
daily
It
seems
my
dreams
faded
for
far
too
long
The
consequences
deadly
Can't
visualize
myself
as
nothing
but
a
criminal
Control
the
block,
serving
up
rocks
and
stay
subliminal
'Cause
young
niggas
is
hardheaded,
they
letting
off
Full
of
adrenaline,
ignorant
to
what
death
can
cause
Ain't
no
coming
back,
family
dressed
in
black
Plus
it's
hot
now,
the
cops
outside,
it's
hard
to
flip
a
pack
And
my
daughter
gotta
eat,
her
mama
be
stressing
me
Like
I
ain't
the
one
who
put
them
Jays
on
her
feet
Like
I
ain't
out
in
the
field
like
that
I
might
be
low
for
the
moment
but
I
will
bounce
back
Despite
the
charges,
back
to
the
wall,
I
fight
regardless
Screaming,
"Fuck
the
law,"
my
life
is
lawless
That's
what
you
call
it,
ain't
got
to
be
no
psychic
To
see
this
is
like
the
farthest
thing
from
heaven
This
is
hell
and
I
don't
mean
that
hyperbolic
I
try
to
find
employment
even
if
it's
wiping
toilets
But
these
felonies
be
making
life
the
hardest
Resisting
the
temptation
to
run
up
and
swipe
a
wallet
Or
run
up
on
your
yard,
snatch
your
daughter
bike
and
pawn
it
That's
why
I
write
this
sonnet
If
the
pressure
get
too
much
for
me
to
take
and
I
break
Play
this
tape
for
my
daughter
and
let
her
know
my
life
is
on
it
(For
your
eyes)
Let
her
know
my
life
is
on
it
(For
your
eyes)
For
your
eyes
only
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand
me?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand
me?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand
me?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand?
For
your
eyes
only
You
probably
grown
now
so
this
song'll
hit
you
If
you
hearing
this,
unfortunately
means
That
I'm
no
longer
with
you
in
the
physical
Not
even
sure
if
I
believe
in
God
but
because
you
still
alive
He
got
me
praying
that
the
spiritual
is
real
So
I
can
be
a
part
of
you
still,
my
pops
was
killed
too
So
I
know
how
part
of
you
feels
Maybe
you
hate
me,
maybe
you
miss
me,
maybe
you
spite
me
Life
goes
in
cycles,
maybe
you'll
date
a
nigga
just
like
me
I
hope
not,
I'm
tired
of
dope
spots
And
fiends
that
smoke
rocks
I've
seen
far
too
many
niggas'
hopes
rot
I'm
writing
this
because
me
and
the
devil
had
a
dance
Now
I
see
death
around
the
corner,
'pologizing
in
advance
Don't
know
if
I
ever
had
a
chance
At
a
glance,
I'm
a
failure
Addicted
to
pushing
paraphernalia
But
Daddy
had
dreams
once,
my
eyes
had
a
gleam
once
Innocence
disappeared
by
the
age
of
eight
years
My
Pops
shot
up,
drug-related,
mama
addicted
So
Granny
raised
me
in
projects
where
thugs
was
hanging
Blood
was
staining
the
concrete
Older
niggas
I
loved
talked
like
they
was
above
Maintaining
a
timesheet,
that's
slow
money
Picked
up
the
family
business
by
the
age
of
13
Six
years
later
was
handed
sentence
'Round
the
same
time
is
when
you
came
in
this
world
Me
and
your
mama
thinking:
"What
the
fuck
we
naming
this
girl?"
I
told
her
"Nina,"
the
prettiest
name
that
I
could
think
of
For
the
prettiest
thing
my
eyes
had
ever
seen,
I
was
19
Took
me
two
felonies
to
see
the
trap
This
crooked-ass
system
set
for
me
And
now
I
fear
it's
too
late
for
me
to
ever
be
The
one
that
set
examples
that
was
never
set
for
me
I'm
living
fast,
but
not
fast
enough
'Cause
karma
keeps
on
catching
up
to
me
And
if
my
past
becomes
the
death
of
me
I
hope
you
understand
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand
me?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand
me?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand
me?
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand?
For
your
eyes
only
It's
several
ways
I
could've
went
out,
too
many
to
count
Was
it
the
trigger
happy
crackers
that
the
badges
give
clout?
Was
it
the
young
niggas,
blasting
frustrated
'Cause
the
cash
running
out?
Niggas
don't
know
how
to
act
in
a
drought
See,
baby
girl,
I
realized
My
definition
of
a
real
nigga
was
skewed
My
views
misshaped
by
new
mixtapes
That
confirmed
the
shit
I
learned
in
the
streets
was
true
That
real
niggas
don't
speak
when
they
beef
with
you
They
just
pull
up
on
your
street,
let
the
heat
achoo
And
if
a
real
nigga
hungry,
he
gon'
eat
your
food
I
was
a
fool,
spent
all
my
time
ducking
school,
ducking
cops
Ducking
rules,
hugging
blocks
that
don't
love
you
I
pray
you
find
a
nigga
with
goals
and
point
of
views
Much
broader
than
the
corner,
if
not
it's
gon'
corner
you
Into
a
box,
where
your
son
don't
even
know
his
pops
And
the
cyclical
nature
of
doing
time
continues
My
worst
fear
is
one
day
that
you
come
home
from
school
And
see
your
father
face
while
hearing
'bout
tragedy
on
news
I
got
the
strangest
feeling
your
daddy
gonna
lose
his
life
soon
And
sadly
if
you're
listening
now
it
must
mean
it's
true
But
maybe
there's
a
chance
that
it's
not
And
this
album
remains
locked
In
a
hard
drive
like
valuable
jewels
And
I
can
teach
you
this
in
person
Like
I'm
teaching
you
to
tie
your
own
shoes
I
love
you
and
I
hope
to
God
I
don't
lose
you
For
your
eyes
only
For
your
eyes,
for
your
eyes
only
For
your
eyes,
for
your
eyes
only
For
your
eyes,
do
you
understand?
For
your
eyes
only
One
day
your
daddy
called
me,
told
me
he
had
a
funny
feeling
What
he'd
been
dealing
with
lately,
he
wasn't
telling
I
tried
to
pick
his
brains,
still
he
wasn't
revealing
But
I
could
feel
the
sense
of
panic
in
his
voice
And
it
was
chilling,
he
said:
"Jermaine,
I
knew
you
since
we
was
children
I
never
asked
for
nothing,
when
times
was
hard
I
never
had
discussions
with
you,
begging
you
to
help
me
I
dealt
with
the
repercussions
of
my
actions
I
know
you
tried
to
steer
me
'way
from
that
shit
But
that
shit
was
in
my
blood,
you
know
my
life
I
know
your
momma,
nigga,
send
my
love
In
case
I
never
get
a
chance
to
speak
again
I
won't
forget
the
weekends
spent
sleeping
at
your
crib
That's
the
way
I
wished
my
family
lived
But
my
granny
crib
was
in
the
'jects"
I
had
to
interject
like:
"Nigga,
what
you
talking
'bout?
Fuck
is
you
getting
at?"
He
said,
"Listen,
I
got
no
time
to
dive
into
descriptions
But
I
been
having
premonitions
Just
call
it
visions
from
the
other
side
I
got
a
feeling
I
won't
see
tomorrow
Like
the
time
I'm
living
on
is
borrowed
With
that
said,
the
only
thing
I'm
proud
to
say,
I
was
a
father
Write
my
story
down,
and
if
I
pass
Go
play
it
for
my
daughter
when
she
ready"
And
so
I'm
leaving
you
this
record,
for
your
eyes
only
Don't
you
ever
scratch
or
disrespect
it
This
perspective
is
a
real
one,
another
lost
'Ville
son
I
dedicate
these
words
to
you
and
all
the
other
children
Affected
by
the
mass
incarceration
in
this
nation
That
sent
your
pops
to
prison
when
he
needed
education
Sometimes
I
think
that
segregation
would've
done
us
better
Although
I
know
that
means
that
I
would
never
Be
brought
into
this
world
'cause
my
daddy
was
so
thrilled
When
he
found
him
a
white
girl
to
take
back
to
Jonesboro
With
lil'
Zach
and
Cole
World,
barely
one
years
old
Now
it's
30
years
later,
making
sure
this
story's
told
Girl,
your
daddy
was
a
real
nigga,
not
'cause
he
was
cold
Not
because
he
was
the
first
To
get
some
pussy
12
years
old
Not
because
he
used
to
come
through
In
the
Caddy
on
some
vogues
Not
because
he
went
from
bagging
up
Them
grams
to
serving
O's
Nah,
your
daddy
was
a
real
nigga,
not
'cause
he
was
hard
Not
because
he
lived
a
life
of
crime
and
sat
behind
some
bars
Not
because
he
screamed,
"Fuck
the
law"
Although
that
was
true
Your
daddy
was
a
real
nigga
'cause
he
loved
you
For
your

Block

cold
Free
to

to
each
his
own
Free
from

free
from
pills
You
roll
it
loud,
the
speakers

Life

hard,
you
ease
your
soul
It
cleanse
ya

learn
to

Then
reach
the
stars,
you
take
the
time
To
look
behind
and
say,
"Look
where
I
came
Look

They
say
that
dreams
come
true
And
when
they
do,

there's
a
beautiful
thing
Now

you
wanna

I

Yeah,
look
The
real
is
back,
the
ville
is
back
Flow
bananas,
here,
peel
this
back
And
what
you'll
find
is,
your
highness
Can
paint
a
picture
that
is
vivid
enough
to
cure
blindness
Carolina's
finest,
you
knew
that
already
In
terms
of
the
greatest,
I
proved
that
already
And
if
you
would
like,
I
do
it
twice
I
just
sharpen
my
blade,
for
a
minute
became
lost
in
my
ways
This
for
my
niggas
that
was
tossed
in
the
graves
Every
so
often
I
fade
deep
in
my
thoughts
And
then
get
lost
in
the
days
We
used
to
play
before
your
coffin
was
made
Just
got
the
call
nigga
got
caught
with
a
stray
Hope
he's
okay
Just
got
paid
what
Cochran
got
paid
to
free
OJ
Just
to
share
my
life
on
the
stage
in
front
of
strangers
Who
know
a
nigga
far
too
well,
and
that's
the
danger
Know
me
better
than
I
know
myself
I
rip
a
page
out
my
notebook
in
anger
And
let
these
thoughts
linger,
singing
Don't
give
'em
too
much
you
(Don't
give
'em
too
much
you)
Don't
let
'em
take
control
(Don't
let
'em
take
control)
It's
one
thing
you
do
(It's
one
thing
you
do)
Don't
let
'em
taint
your
soul
(Don't
let
'em
taint
your
soul)
If
you
believe
in
God
(If
you
believe
in
God)
One
thing's
for
sure
(One
thing's
for

If
you
ain't
aim
too
high
(If
you
ain't
aim

high)
Then
you
aim
too
low
(Then
you
aim
too

What's
the
price
for
a
black
man
life?
I
check
the
toe
tag,
not
one
zero
in
sight
I
turn
the
TV
on,
not
one
hero
in
sight
Unless
he
dribble
or
he
fiddle
with
mics
Look
out
the
window
'cause
tonight
the
city
lit
up
with
lights
Cameras
and
action
May
no
man
alive
come
through
and
damage
my
faction
And
your
mothers'
like
my
mother
Think
we
need
a
plan
of
action
The
bigger
we
get
the
more
likely
egos
collide,
it's
just
physics
Please
let's
put
our
egos
aside,
you
my
niggas
And
should
our
worst
tendencies
turn
us
into
enemies
I
hope
that
we
remember
these
Nights
fulla
Hennessey
When
Hov
around
we

up
to

Gotta

'Cause

Keep

And

New

get
Obama

Never

That's

world,

Let
me
take
y'all
back,
man
As
I
do
so
well
Wasn't
nothin'
like
that
Man,
it
wasn't
nothin'
like
that
first
time,
she
was
in
my
math
class
Long
hair,
brown
skin
with
a
fat
ass
Sat
beside
me,
used
to
laugh,
had
mad
jokes
The
teacher
always
got
mad
so
we
passed
notes
It
started
off
so
innocent
She
had
a
vibe
and
a
nigga
started
diggin'
it
I
was
a
youngin,
straight
crushin',
tryna
play
the
shit
cool
But
a
nigga
couldn't
wait
to
get
to
school
‘Cause
when
I
seen
them
thighs
on
her
And
them
hips
on
her
and
them
lips
on
her
Got
me
daydreamin',
man,
what
I'm
thinkin'
how
she
rides
on
it,
if
she
sits
on
it,
if
she
licks
on
it
Make
it
hard
for
me
to
stand
up
As
time
goes
by,
attractions
gettin'
deep
and
Wet
dreamin',
thinkin'
that
I'm
smashin'
but
I'm
sleepin'
I
want
it
bad,
and
I
ain't
never
been
obsessed
before
She
wrote
a
note
that
said,
"You
ever
had
sex
before?"
Damn…
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
nooo
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
I
wrote
back
and
said
"Of
course
I
had
sex
before,"
knowin'
I
was
frontin'
I
said,
"I'm
like
a
pro,
baby,"
knowin'
I
was
stuntin'
But
if
I
told
the
truth,
I
knew
that
I'd
get
played
out,
son
Hadn't
been
in
pussy
since
the
day
I
came
out
one
But
she
don't
know
that,
so
she
done
wrote
back
and
told
me
"Oh,
you
a
pro,
homie?
Well,
I
want
you
to
show
me
My
mama
gone
for
the
weekend
So
Saturday,
baby,
we
can
get
to
freakin'."
That's
when
my
heart
start
racin'
and
my
body
start
sweatin'
Baby,
you
done
woke
my
lil'
man
up
I'm
thinkin'
how
that
body
look
naked
when
you
layin'
on
the
bed
Teacher,
please,
don't
make
me
stand
up
I
wrote
back
like,
"Yeah,
baby,
sound
like
a
plan."
Still
tryna
play
it
cool,
sound
like
the
man
But
I
was
scared
to
death,
my
nigga,
my
stomach
turnin'
Talkin'
shit,
knowin'
damn
well
I
was
a
virgin
Fuck…
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
nooo
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
You
know
that
feelin'
when
you
know
You
finna
bone
for
the
first
time?
I'm
hopin'
that
she
won't
notice
it's
my
first
time
I'm
hopin'
that
my
shit
is
big
enough
to
fuck
with
And
most
of
all
I'm
prayin',
"God,
don't
let
me
bust
quick!"
I'm
watchin'
pornos,
tryna
see
just
how
to
stroke
right
Practice
puttin'
condoms
on—how
it
go,
right?
I'm
in
her
crib,
now
a
nigga
palms
sweatin'
With
a
pocket
full
of
rubbers
and
an
erection
That's
when
my
hands
start
touchin'
And
her
face
start
blushin'
and
a
nigga
roll
over
on
top
And
then
she
get
my
pants
unbuckled
And
her
hands
start
rubbin'
on
me,
ooh
girl,
don't
stop
It's
time
for
action
Pull
out
the
condoms
real
smooth,
yeah,
just
how
I
practiced
But
right
before
I
put
it
in,
she
flinched
and
grabbed
it
And
said,
"I
wanna
get
somethin'
off
my
mental
I
can
tell
you're
a
pro,
but
baby,
be
gentle,
‘cause—"
‘Cause
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
nooo
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
And
I
ain't
never
did
this
before,
no
I
grew
up,
a
fucking
screw
up
Tie
my
shoe
up,
wish
they
was
newer
Damn,
need
something
newer
In
love
with
the
baddest
girl
in
the
city,
I
wish
I
knew
her
I
wish
I
wasn't
so
shy,
I
wish
I
was
a
bit
more
fly
I
wish
that
I
could
tell
her
how
I
really
feel
inside
That
I'm
the
perfect
nigga
for
her,
but
then
maybe
that's
a
lie
She
like
a
certain
type
of
nigga
and
it's
clear
I'm
not
that
guy
Ball
player,
star
player,
I'm
just
watchin'
from
the
side
On
the
bench,
'cause
my
lack
of
confidence
won't
let
me
fly
I
ain't
grow
up
with
my
father,
I
ain't
thinkin'
'bout
that
now
Fast
forward
four
years
or
so
from
now
I'll
probably
cry
When
I
realize
what
I
missed,
but
as
of
now
my
eyes
are
dry
'Cause
I'm
trying
to
stay
alive
In
the
city
where
too
many
niggas
die
Dreamin'
quiet
trying
to
dodge
a
suit
and
tie
Who
am
I?
Ayy,
who
am
I?
(Yeah)
Things
change,
rearrange
and
so
do
I
It
ain't
always
for
the
better,
dawg,
I
can't
lie
I
get
high
'cause
the
lows
can
be
so
cold
I
might
bend
a
little
bit
but
I
don't
fold
One
time
for
my
mind
and
two
for
yours
I
got
food
for
your
thoughts
to
soothe
your
soul
If
you
see
my
tears
fall
just
let
me
be
Move
along,
nothing
to
see
I
always
did
shit
the
hard
way
Burnt
CD's
and
trees
like
this
was
Broadway
Times
Square,
kept
the
dimes
there
in
the
locker
Some
Reggie
Miller
With
more
brown
hairs
than
Chewbacca
Whispers
that
he
got
it
for
the
low-low,
sell
a
Dime
for
a
dub,
them
white
boys
ain't
know
no
better
Besides,
what's
twenty
dollars
to
a
nigga
like
that?
He
tell
his
pops
he
need
some
lunch
And
he
gon'
get
it
right
back
I
peep
game
Got
home
snatched
my
mama
keychain
Took
her
whip,
the
appeal,
too
ill
to
refrain
I
hit
the
boulevard
pull
up
to
my
nigga
front
do'
His
mama
at
home,
she
still
let
'em
hit
the
blunt
though
I
told
her
hello,
and
sat
with
my
nigga
and
laughed
And
talked
about
how
we
gon'
smash
all
the
bitches
in
class
I
complimented
how
I
see
him
out
here
getting
his
cash
And
just
asked,
"What
a
nigga
gotta
do
to
get
that?
Put
me
on,"
he
just
laughed
when
he
seen
I
was
sure
17
years
breathing
his
demeanor
said
more
He
told
me,
"Nigga,
you
know
how
you
sound
right
now?
If
you
wasn’t
my
mans
I
would
think
that
you
a
clown
right
now
Listen,
you
everything
I
wanna
be
that's
why
I
fucks
with
you
So
how
you
looking
up
to
me
when
I
look
up
to
you?
You
bout
to
go
get
a
degree,
I'ma
be
stuck
with
two
choices:
Either
graduate
to
weight
or
selling
number
two
For
what?
A
hundred
bucks
or
two
a
week?
Do
you
think
that
you
would
know
what
to
do
if
you
was
me?
I
got,
four
brothers,
one
mother
that
don't
love
us
If
they
ain't
want
us
why
the
fuck
they
never
wore
rubbers?"
I
felt
ashamed
to
have
ever
complained
about
my
lack
of
gear
And
thought
about
how
far
we
done
came
From
trailer
park
to
a
front
yard
with
trees
in
the
sky
Thank
you
mama,
dry
your
eyes,
there
ain't
no
reason
to
cry
You
made
a
genius
and
I,
ain't
gon'
take
it
for
granted
I
ain't
gon'
settle
for
lesser,
I
ain't
gon'
take
what
they
handed
Nah,
I'm
gon'
take
what
they
owe
me
And
show
you
that
I
can
fly
And
show
old
girl
what
she
missing,
the
illest
nigga
alive
Ayy,
who
am
I?
Things
change,
rearrange
and
so
do
I
(Ayy,
who
am
I?)
It
ain't
always
for
the
better,
dawg,
I
can't
lie
(Who
am
I?)
I
get
high
'cause
the
lows
can
be
so
cold
I
might
bend
a
little
bit
but
I
don't
fold
One
time
for
my
mind
and
two
for
yours
I
got
food
for
your
thoughts
to
soothe
your
soul
If
you
see
my
tears
fall
just
let
me
be
Move
along,
nothing
to
see
I
never
felt
better
Since
a
youngin'
always
dreamed
of
gettin'
rich
Look
at
me
my
nigga
Fantasize
about
a
white
picket
fence
With
some
trees
my
nigga
Used
to
want
a
Pathfinder
with
some
tints
That's
all
I
need
my
nigga
Throw
some
20's
on
that
bitch
and
get
it
rinsed
But
now
I
see
my
nigga
That
the
world's
a
lot
bigger
ever
since
Picked
up
the
paper
And
they
say
my
nigga
Eddie
caught
a
body,
I'm
convinced
Anybody
is
a
killer,
all
you
gotta
do
is
push
'em
to
the
limits
Fuck
being
timid
in
the
Civic
Politicin'
with
the
pushers
and
the
pimps
I'm
tryna
write
a
story,
can
I
get
a
glimpse?
Yeah,
can
I
get
a
glimpse?
Last
night
I
had
a
bad
dream
That
I
was
trapped
in
this
city
Then
I
asked
is
that
really
such
a
bad
thing?
They
robbin'
niggas
on
the
daily
Can
you
blame
a
nigga
that
ain't
never
had
things?
Guess
not!
(What's
the
value
of
a
thing?)
Last
night
they
pulled
up
on
my
nigga
at
the
light
like—
Ugh,
nice
watch,
run
it
Hands
in
the
air
now,
hands
in
the
air,
run
it
Hands

now,
hands
in
the

it
Hands
in
the
air
now,
hands
in
the

Hands
in
the
air
now,
hands
in
the
air
Small
town
nigga
Hollywood
dreams
I
know
that
everything
that

I

it
seems
But

me
till
you
get

you

How

How

you

Listen

Fuck

Cop

And

You

One

And

Listen

Stand

Crown

Wanna

Even
if
you
let
em'
kill
your
dream
It'll
haunt
you
nigga,
haunt
you
Last
night
I
had
a
bad
dream
That
I
was
trapped
in
this
city
Then
I
asked
is
that
really
such
a
bad
thing?
I
look
around
like—
Do
you
wanna
be
another
nigga,
that
ain't
never
had
things?
Guess
not!
(What's
the
value
of
a
thing?)
Last
night
we
pulled
up
on
a
nigga
at
the
light
like
(You
know
what
the
fuck
it
is
nigga,
run

shit!)
Uh,

Hands

Hands

Hands

Hands

Father
forgive
me
for
my
childish
ways
I
look
outside
and
all
the
clouds
are
gray
I
need
your
hands
to
take
me
miles

Your
wish

But

I've
got
to

Whatever

up
surely
must
come
down
And

get
your
piece,

peace
won't
be
found
So

Your

Come

Ain't

A

My

In

cause
niggas

one
And
I

Forgive

Hold

a
nigga
and

My
inhibition's
fighting
my
intuition
Premature
premonition,
showing
me
the
demolition
Of
these
phony
niggas,
so
ahead
of
my
time
Even
when
I

the
future

You

time

As

half
of
you
try
The
other
half
of
you
fry,
too
high
to
actually

One
day
y'all
have
to
decide,
who

A
scary
nigga
or
a
nigga

Come
here
baby
why
you
always
insecure?
Hold
on
tight
to
a
nigga
and
be
sure
(Who's
the
king?)
Came
from
the
bottom
nigga,
with
stains
on
my
shirt
What
you
expected
from
me,
I
came
from
the
dirt
(Who's
the
king?)
Money
my
motivator,
the
songs
that
I
sing
Picture
a
peasant
passin'
from
pawn
to
a
king
You
tell
me
ya
still
love
me,
if
so
then
let
me
go
Will
I
return
or
will
I
burn,
never
know
Look
in
my
eyes
and
see
the
future
But
don't
sugar
coat
it
Listen...
History
repeats
itself
and
that's
just
how
it
goes
Same
way
that
these
rappers
always
bite
each
others
flows
Same
thing
that
my
nigga
Elvis
did
with
Rock
n
Roll
Justin
Timberlake,
Eminem
and
then
Macklemore
While
silly
niggas
argue
over
who
gon'
snatch
the
crown
Look
around,
my
nigga,
white
people
have
snatched
the
sound
This
year
I’ll
prolly
go
to
the
awards
dappered
down
Watch
Iggy
win
a
Grammy
as
I
try
to
crack
a
smile
I'm
just
playin',
but
all
good
jokes
contain
true
shit
Same
rope
you
climb
up
on,
they'll
hang
you
with
But
not
Jermaine,
my
aim
too
sick
I
bang
nigga,
I
came
to
bring
the
pain
my
brain
too
quick
You
see
how
I
maneuver
this
game,
I
ain't
stupid
I
recognize
that
life
is
a
dream,
and
I
dream
lucid
And
break
the
chains
and
change
minds
One
verse
at
a
time,
and
claim
2-6
And
fuck
it,
if
the
shoe
fits,
who's
the
king?
We
all
kings
(We
all
kings
nigga)
Kings
of
ourselves
first
and
foremost
(True)
While
the
people
debate
who's
the
king
of
this
rap
game
Here
comes
lil'
ol'
Jermaine
With
every
ounce
of
strength
in
his
veins
To
snatch
the
crown
from
whoever
y'all
think
has
it
But
rather
than
place
it
on
his
head
as
soon
as
he
grabs
it
Poof,
boom,
paow,
it's
like
magic
With
a
flash
and
a
BANG
the
crown
disintegrates
And
falls
to
the
Earth
from
which
it
came
It's
done
Ain't
gonna
be
no
more
kings
Be
wary
of
any
man
that
claims
Because
deep
down
he
clings
onto
the
need
for
power
The
reality,
he's
a
coward
Ultimately
he's
scared
to
die
And
sometimes
so
am
I
But
when
I'm
in
tune
with
the
most
high
I
realize,
the
fear
lies
in
my
lack
of
awareness
of
the
other
side
Today
I
know
that
we
are
the
same,
are
the
same,
you
and
I
Different
kind
of
skin,
different
set
of
eyes
Two
different
minds,
but
only
one
God
(It's
only
one
God
nigga)
It's
for
all
the
kings
'Cause
I
know
deep
down
every
poet
just
wanna
be
loved
Roll
up
and
smoke
my
sins
away
I'd
like
to
go
to
St.
Tropez
Maybe
I'll
go,
maybe
I'll
stay
(Maybe
I'll
stay)
She
asked
me
if
I'm
scared
to
fly
To
tell
the
truth,
I'm
terrified
I
never
been
that
high
before
Very
bad
reason
not
to
go
Terrible
reason
not
to
go

Ay

the
door
I

you
my
scars
And
I
told
you
girl,
"I
won't
lie"
If
we
at

then
this
is
a
war
that
I
can't
afford,
no
I,
I,

I
wanted

but
that
was
before
Lord

I'm
torn,

I–I
cry
(No
I,
I,
I)
From
the
corner
of
my
eye,
baby
It's
been
hard
for
me
to

No

I'm
here
right
now
No
role
models
to
speak
of
Searchin'
through
my
memory,
my

I
couldn't

Last

I

By

This

And
tell
her,
"Hey,
what's

"Sorry
I'm
never
comin'
home,
I'ma
stay
for

Then
hang
the
phone
up
and
proceed
to
lay
the
wood
I
came
fast
like
9-1-1
in
white
neighborhoods
Ain't

She
think
I'm
spoiled
and
I'm
rich
'cause
I
can
have
any
bitch
I
got
defensive
and
said,
"Nah,
I
was
the
same
without
it."
But
then
I
thought
back,
back
to

Before
I
was
a
B-list
celebrity
Before
I
started

so
heavily
Back

Oh

now?
Oh

oh
Oh
why
na-da-da-da
I
keep
my
head
high
I
got
my
wings
to
carry
me
I
don't
know
freedom
I
want
my
dreams
to
rescue
me
I
keep
my
faith
strong
I
ask
the
Lord
to
follow
me
I've
been
unfaithful
I
don't
know
why
you
call
on
me
This
is
my
canvas
I'ma
paint
it
how
I
want
it
baby,
oh

This
is

canvas
I'ma

nigga
Fuck
you
cause
there,
there
is
no
right
or
wrong,
only
a
song
I
like
to
write
alone,
be
in
my
zone
Think
back
to
Forest
Hills,
no
perfect
home
But
the
only
thing
like
home
I've
ever
known
Until
they
snatched
it
from
my
mama
And
foreclosed
her
on
the
loan
I'm
so
sorry
that
I
left
you
there
to
deal
with
that
alone
I
was
up
in
New
York
City
chasing
panties,
getting
dome
Had
no
clue
what
you
was
going
through
How
could
you
be
so
strong?
And
how
could
I
be
so
selfish,
I
know
I
can
be
so
selfish
I
could
tell
by
how
I
treat
you
with
my
girl,
damn
she
so
selfless
But
she
put
up
with
my
ways
because
she
loves
me
like
you
do
And
though
it
don't
always
show
I
love
her
just
like
I
love
you
And
I
need
to
treat
you
better
Wish
you
could
live
forever
So
we
could
spend
more
time
together
I
love
you
mama
I
keep
my
head
high
I
got
my
wings
to
carry
me
I
don't
know
freedom
I
want
my
dreams
to
rescue
me
I
keep
my
faith
strong
I
ask
the
Lord
to
follow
me
I've
been
unfaithful
I
don't
know
why
you
call
on
me
E-e-eee,
e-e,
apparently
You
believe
in
me,

E-e-eee,

You

Another

time
zone
Today,
I
woke
up
feeling
horny
so
it's
only
right
I
got
two
bitches
playing
on
my
trombone
Keep
up,
never
sure
where
the
words
would
take
me
Niggas
eat
em
up,
and
regurgitate
me
Shit
trump
tight
never
slurred
it
lazy
Give
a
virgin
the
urge
to
rape
me,
nigga
please
Best
friends
really
make
great
for
enemies
My
watch

to
me
nigga—uh,
couldn't
resist
Aim
for
the
stars
and
I
shouldn't
have
missed
But
I
was
riding
on
fumes
so
I
stopped
by
the
moon
Now
I'm
sitting
on
the
hood
of
this
bitch
Like,
"Thanks
for
the
view",
waiting
on
thanks
from
a
few
Cause
without
me
you
wouldn't
exist
You
know
that
shit,
gave
you
the
blueprint,
don't
forget
Cole

your
phone
on
zero
percent
Going

Niggas

hard
but
they
flowing
soft
I'm
taking

like
"boing!"
on
a
big
ass
Boeing
Getting
head
like
a
coin
toss,
too
easy
I
keep
my
head
high
I
got
my
wings
to
carry
me
I
don't
know
freedom
I
want
my
dreams
to
rescue
me
I
keep
my
faith
strong
I
ask
the
Lord
to
follow
me
I've
been
unfaithful
I
don't
know
why
you
call
on
me
E-e-eee,

You

E-e-eee,

You

Heart

Fake

Snakes

the
grass
let
a
nigga
know
that
he

Don't
be
sleepin'
on
your
level
'Cause
it's
beauty
in
the
struggle,

(Beauty,

Goes

y'all
It's
beauty
in
the

nigga
(Beauty,

Let
me
explain,
yeah
It's
beauty
in
the
struggle,
ugliness
in
the
success
Hear
my
words
or
listen
to
my
signal
of
distress
I
grew
up
in
the
city
and
know
sometimes
we
had
less
Compared
to
some
of
my
niggas
Down
the
block,
man,
we
were
blessed
And
life
can't
be
no
fairytale,
no
once
upon
a
time
But
I
be
goddamned
if
a
nigga
don't
be
tryin'
So
tell
me,
Momma
please,
why
you
be
drinkin'
all
the
time?
Does
all
the
pain
he
brought
you
still
linger
in
your
mind?
'Cause
pain
still
lingers
on
mine
On
the
road
to
riches,
listen,
this
is
what
you'll
find
The
good
news
is,
nigga,
you
came
a
long
way
The
bad
news
is,
nigga,
you
went
the
wrong
way
Think
being
broke
was
better
No
such
thing
as
a
life
that's
better
than
yours
No
such
thing
as
a
life
that's

yours
(think
being
broke
was
better)
No
such
thing
as
a
life
that's
better
than
yours
No
such
thing,
no
such
thing
For
what's
money
without
happiness?
Or
hard
times
without
the
people
you
love?
Though
I'm
not
sure
what's
'bout
to
happen
next
I
ask
for
strength
from
the
Lord
up
above
'Cause
I've
been
strong
so
far
But
I
can
feel
my
grip
loosenin'
Quick,
do
somethin'
before
you
lose
it
for
good
Get
it
back
and
use
it
for
good
And
touch
the
people
how
you
did
like
before
I'm
tired
of
livin'
with
demons
'cause
they
always
invitin'
more
Think
being
broke
was
better
Now
I
don't
mean
that
phrase
with
no
disrespect
To
all
my
niggas
out
there
livin'
in
debt
Cashin'
minimal
checks,
turn
on
the
TV
see
a
nigga
Rolex
And
fantasize
about
a
life
with
no
stress
I
mean
this
shit
sincerely
And
as
a
nigga
who
was
once
in
your
shoes
Livin'
with
nothin'
to
lose,
I
hope
one
day
you
hear
me
Always
gon'
be
a
bigger
house
somewhere,
but
nigga
feel
me
Long
as
the
people
in
that
motherfucker
love
you
dearly
Always
gon'
be
a
whip
that's
better
than
the
one
you
got
Always
gon'
be
some
clothes
that's
fresher
than
the
ones
you
rock
Always
gon'
be
a
bitch
that's
badder
out
there
on
the
tours
But
you
ain't
never
gon'
be
happy
'til
you
love
yours
No
such
thing
as
a
life
that's
better
than
yours
(Love
yours)
No

You'll

in
the

I've

a
feeling
that
there's
somethin'
more
Something
that
holds
us
together
Something

The

One

Little

in
a

he'd
be

what
could
you
say
to
me?
I
Beat
the
odds
like
Vegas,
I

to
rap
about
haters
Before

was
hating
me,
now
they
hate
to
see
A
young
black
man

Fucking

You

strapped

I

where
niggas

living
heartless
And
cannot
tell
the
difference
between
Iraqi,
Israeli
And

I'm
wondering
really
what
could
you
actually
tell
me
I'm
tryna
keep
my
homie
from
throwing
crack

So,

Took

But

sorry
Never

Fucked

Ferraris,
vroom
Please

him
According
to
the

But

Devil

T.V.
so

demons

'em
I'm
in

Did
a
deal
with
the
Devil,
now
I'm
pleading
with
him
Like
give
me
my
soul
My

I
ain't
ever
letting
you

Please

Please

I
ain't

But
the
Devil
don't
play

I'm
'bout
to

Illuminati
Fuck

Young
black
millionaire
Old
white
billionaires,
I'm

that
they

Couple

she
knew
it
probably
Well
this
is
awkward,

Want

in
my

smirking

"let
me
stroke"
money
Put
up
a
couple
dollars
for
the
liquor
store
money
Used
to
dread
the
strip
club
cause
I
couldn't
throw
money
Now
the
strippers
give
a
nigga
the
throat
for
no
money
How
mama
gonna
teach
you
how
to
save
your
money
When
she
barely
on
the
boat,
got
stay
afloat
money
Blacks
always
broke
cause
we
don't
know
money
Spend
it
'fore
we
get
it
and
could
never
hold
money
No
wallets,
nah,
nigga
we'd
rather
fold
money
Money
control
niggas,
white
man
control
money
Laughing
like
"yeah
yeah

nigga

your
money"

said)
Set

off
on
my
left,

on
my
right
(I
said)
Liquor

on
my
breath,
bitches
all
in
my
sight
(I
said)
Real
niggas
tryna
fuck,

(I
said)
Gun
shots
into
the
air,
but
I
ain't
scared
for
my
life
(I
said)
Troubles

Troubles

Yeah,

Paint

picture
like
a
young
Pablo,
Picasso
Niggas
say
"Live
fast,

young,"
so
I
drive
slow
And

In

Met

Chicago,

Kept

Chi

I

her,
but
I'm
thinking
'bout

My
niggas

why
you
gotta
think
about
it?
The
bitch
want
too
much,
hit
my
phone
too
much
If
I
gotta
be
frank
about
it
Ain't
worth
the
stress
First
the
text,
then
the
draws,
see
first
is
sex
Then
it's
calls
cause
the
bird's
obsessed
Want
flowers,
cards,
and
the
purses
next
Nah,
bitch
can't
get
a
dollar
Cole

Twitter,
bitch
can't
get
a
follow
Can
get
a
nut,
heard
"Can't
Get
Enough"
Now
she
fuck
a
nigga
thinking
that
she
may
have
hit
the
lotto
No

Could

book
called,
"The
Things
Hoes
Say"
Show
a
lot
of
love
to
my
sisters

But

Only

Young

Cheated

She

"Don't

"Nigga,

Yeah,

Couldn't

Liquor

Real

Gun

I

(I

Married
men
act
totally
different
when
they're
by
themselves,
don't
they?
You
see
'em
with
their
wife,
"What's

Tony?"
"Hey
man,
how's
everything
going
brother?
Oh,
just
taking
it
easy,
hanging
out
with
the
old
lady.
Alright,
God
bless
you,
take

easy
now,
alright."
You

like
that
nigga
ain't

You

him
by
himself,
"What's
up
Tony?"
"Hey,

the
bitches

nigga?!
Where's
the
bitches?!"
Yeah
Gimme
my
space,
Lord,
ain't
enough
time
to
chase
All
these
dreams,
nah
mean?
I
got
no
time
to
wait
Love
my
girl,
but
I
told
her
straight
up,
"Don't
wait
up"
Stumble
home
late,
I'm
drunk,
we
fucked
and
made
up
Used
to
living
free
as
a
bird,
but
now
I'm
laid
up
Feelin'
like
a
nigga
got
handcuffs
on
How
the
fuck
did
my
life
become
a
damn
love
song?
She
ride
for
a
nigga
and
she
stand
up
for
him
But
a
nigga
wan'
be
a
nigga,
be
a
nigga
Ride
through
the
streets
with
freaks
and
real
niggas
She'll
never
understand
what
it's
like
to
be
a
man
Knowin'
when
you
look
inside
yourself
you
see
a
nigga
And
you
don't
wan'
let
her
down
But
you
too
young
for
the
settle
down
And
maybe
you
can
thug
it
out,
learn
what
is
love
about
When
you
can't
live
with
her
and
you
can't
live
without
Aw
shit,
goddamn,
I
think
the
devil
got
his
hands
on
me
Stripper
saying,
"Baby,
won't
you
throw
them
bands
on
me?"
And
I
came
to
spend
She
pop
a
molly,
let
the
motherfuckin'
games
begin
I'm
running
away
Runaway,
runaway
Runaway,
runaway
I'm
holdin'
on
Desperately
Runaway,
runaway
Runaway,
runaway
I'm
holdin'
on
When
it's
all
said
and
done
everybody
dies
In
this
life
ain't
no
happy
endings
Only
pure
beginnings
followed
by
years
of
sinning
and
fake
repentance
The
preacher
say
we
were
made
in
image
of
Lord
To
which
I
replied:
"Are
you
sure?
Even
a
murderer?
Even
a
whore?
Even
a
nigga
running
through
bitches
on
tour
With
a
good
girl
at
home
folding
clothes
and
shit?"
She
losin'
faith
in
him
and
he
knows
the
shit,
like,
"What
the
fuck
is
a
break?
Don't
know
how
much
I
can
take
no
more
I
give
you
all
I
got
'til
it
ain't
no
more
No
more
tears,
it's
been
ten
long
years
Damn
near,
I
don't
know
if
I
can
wait
no
more"
And
who
can
blame
her,
you
complain
about
Every
time
you
out,
you
come
back
she
poutin'
Sleeping
back
to
back,
this
is
whack,
we
'bout
To
go
platinum
and
I'm
in
the
crib
acting
out
My
childhood
fantasies
of
wife
and
home
But
it's
a
whole
lot
of
actresses
I'd
like
to
bone
And
despite
the
rumors
you
hold
out
On
account
of
your
guilt
and
she
has
got
to
spend
her
nights
alone
And
she
ride
or
die
like
Eve
and
'em
Make
home-cooked
meals
every
evenin'
And
even
in
your
lowest
days
When
you're
no
longer
Superman,
at
least
you
know
you
got
Lois
Lane
But
you
Runaway,
runaway
Runaway,
runaway
I'm
holdin'
on
Desperately
Runaway,
runaway
Runaway,
runaway
I'm
holdin'
on
Yeah
Unbelievable,
seen
evil
that
not
even
Knievel
know
At
age
three
I
knew
this
world
was
three
below
Listen,
even
though
my
ego
low,
achieved
the
unachievable
Imagine
if
my
confidence
was
halfway
decent
yo
This
just
in,
fucked
more
bitches
than
Bieber
though
Still
I
keep
it
low,
got
my
niggas
on
the
need
to
know
Basis,
my
manager
back
in
the
days
was
racist
I
was
a
young
boy,
passing
skates
and
tucking
laces
Old
perverted
white
man
who
told
me,
"Jermaine
It's
all
pink
on
the
inside,
fuck
what
color
they
face
is"
Wise
words
from
an
indecent
man
Made
me
reflect
on
the
times
when
we
was
three-fifths
of
them
In
chains
and
powerless,
brave
souls
reduced
to
cowardice
Slaving
in
the
baking
sun
for
hours
just
To
see
the
master
creep
into
the
shack
where
your
lady
at
Nine
months
later
got
a
baby,
that's
Not
quite
what
you
expected,
but
you
Refuse
to
neglect
it,
'cause
you
Know
your
wifey
loves
you,
thus
you
refuse
to
accept
it
That’s
the
type
of
shit
that
turned
my
granny
light-skinned
Rich
white
men
rule
the
nation
still
Only
difference
is
we
all
slaves
now,
the
chains
concealed
In
our
thoughts,
if
I
follow
my
heart
to
save
myself
Could
I
run
away
from
fifty-mill
like
Dave
Chappelle?
You
know
Runaway,
runaway
Runaway,
runaway
I'm
holdin'
on
Desperately
Runaway,
runaway
Runaway,
runaway
I'm
holdin'
on
She
knows
She
knows,
ayy
Bad
things
happen
to
the
people
you
love
And
you
find
yourself
praying
up
to
heaven
above
But
honestly
I’ve
never
had
much
sympathy
'Cause
those
bad
things,
I
always
saw
them
coming
for
me
I’m
gonna
run
run
away
(oh
I),
run
run
away,
run

(oh

Run

and
never
come
back

Run

your
color
is
black
(well
all
right)
Damned
if
I
do
Damned
if
I
don't
You
know
I
got
a
girl
back
home
You
got
a
man
what
you
want,
what

What

bitches

a

On

On

A

When

let
you
know
you
ain't

When

second
job
Delivering

Please

I

Half

Talking

How

that
nigga,
plus
dawg,
I'm
a
grown
man
now
I
ain't
mad
at
that
nigga
But
if
a
plane
crashed
and
it
only
killed
his
lame
ass
I'd
be
glad
it's
that
nigga,
nigga
Did
Kay

Refund

used
that
to
float
Momma
gets
depressed,
falls
in
love
with
the
next
maniac
On

use
that
to
cope
Make
a
nigga
smoke
a
whole
sack
of
dope
Writing
rhymes,
tryna
bring
back
the
hope
Try
to
ride
the
storm
out
and
crashed
the
boat
Could've
drowned,
but
I
grabbed
the
rope
And
there
go
you,
and
there
go
you,
and
there
go
you
Selling
me
dreams
and
telling
me
things
you
knew
And
there
go
you,
and
there
go
you,
and
there
go
you
Selling
me
dreams
and
telling
me
things
you
knew
Sing,

got
what
I
want,
I
got
what
you
need
"How
much
for
your
soul,
Anna?"
"How
much
for
your
soul,
Anna?"
You

"How

I
hate
rich
niggas,
god
damn

'Cause
I
ain't
never
had
a
lot,
damn

Niggas
can't
front
on
the
flows
you
got
But
every
fucking
verse
how
much
dough
you
got
Homie,
don't
quit
now
Hear
my
shit
and
tried
to
switch
now
Know
you
felt
the
shit
just
now,
know
you
felt
the
shit
just
now
Ain't
there
more
to
you?
Don't
it
ever
get
boring
to
you?
I
realize
deep
down
you
a
coward
getting
high
off
of
power,
fuck
it
more
to
you
Saw
through
you
and
it
made
me
ashamed
that
I
played
the
game
Not
for
mo'
money
like
Damon
Wayans
Wanted
the
respect
but
it
came
with
fame
I
just
wanted
love
but
this
ain't
the
same
I
took
a
train
down
memory
lane
And
watched
little
Jermaine
do
his
thing
before
he
made
a
name
It's
like
Sony
signed
Basquiat
He
gave
it
all
he
got,
and
now
a
nigga
don't
paint
the
same,
damn
I
guess
he
can't
complain
All
the
money
that
be
raining
in
Spend
a
hundred
thou
for
the
chain
again
Think
of
old
school
niggas
like
Dana
Dane
Probably
kill
for
another
claim
to
fame,
my
brain
the
same
Yeah,
nigga,
at
least
he
ain't
insane
At
least
he
ain't
insane
You
ain't
crazy,
motherfucker,
you
just
afraid
of
change
That's
new,
maybe
that's
true
But
listen
here
I
got
a
bigger
fear
Of
one
day
that
I
become
you
When
I
become
lost
and
I
become
heartless
And
numb
from
all
the
Ménages
Just
one
bitch
don't
feel
the
same
no
more
And
Henny
don't
really
kill
the
pain
no
more
Now
I'm
Cobain
with
a
shotgun
aimed
at
my
brain
Cause
I
can't
maintain
no
more
Tad
bit
extreme
I
know
Money
can't
save
your
soul
But
there
go
you
And
there
go
you,
and
there
go
you,
and
there
go
you
Selling
me
dreams
and
telling
me
things
you
knew
And
there
go
you,
and
there
go
you,
and
there
go
you
Selling
me
dreams
and
telling
me
things
you
knew
Sing,
you
got
what
I
want,
I
got
what
you
need
"How
much
for
your
soul,
Anna?"
"How
much
for
your
soul,
Anna?"
You

For
being

precious
friend
I
give
thanks
to
you
For
holding
our
spirits
high
I
do
thank
you
lord
For
blessing
my
life
each
day
I
give
thanks
to
you
For
always
being
there
when
all

Unto

wanna
be
you
And
police
wanna
stop
you,
frisk
you
wonder
what
he
do
If
a
hater
snatch
your
chain,
I
bet
it
still
won't
free
you
'Cause
I
be
right
back
grinding
'til
I
cop
another
I
sit
and
think
about
all
this
shit
I
coulda
copped
my
mother
My
partner
said
that's
just
the
game
my
nigga
Swear
I
heard
my
jeweler
say,
"Here
go
your
chain
my
nigga"
This
is
chaining
day
I
need
you
to
love
me
(Chaining
day),
love
me
(Ohh
my
chaining
day)
I
need
you
to
love
me
(My
chaining
day),
love
me
My
last
piece,
I
swear
My
guilt
heavy
as
this
piece
I
wear
(Love
me,
love
me,
hey
hey)
They
even
iced
out
Jesus'
hair
My
last
piece,
I
swear
(Love
me,
love
me)
They
even
iced
out
Jesus'
hair
Ice
on
this
white
Jesus
seem
a
little
unholy
The
real
strange
thing
about
this
iced
out
Roley
It's
the
same
shit
a
broke
black
nigga
get
gassed
at
Same
shit
a
rich
white
motherfucka
laugh
at
Well
laugh
on
white
man,
I
ain't
paid
as
you
But
I
bet
your
rims
ain't
the
same
age
as
you
And
I
ain't
got
no
investment
portfolio
But
my
black
and
white
diamonds
shinin'
like
a
Oreo
I
know
back
home
a
nigga
sick
today
He
rock
a
chain
and
he
always
got
some
shit
to
say
Even
back
when
I
was
broke
I
knew
his
shit
was
fake
He'd
prolly
sneeze
too
hard
and
his
shit
could
break
But
hey,
you
know
the
sayin',
"Fake
it
'til
you
make
it"
Me,
I
did
the
opposite,
made
it
then
I
faked
it
And
acted
like
I
gave
a
fuck,
money
I
was
savin'
up
To
buy
a
crib
that's
gated
'til
hundred
racks,
I
gave
it
up
For
what
I
need
you
to
love
me
(Chaining
day),
love
me
(Ohh,
my
chaining
day)
I
need
you
to
love
me
(My
chaining
day),
love
me
My
last
piece,
I
swear
My
guilt
heavy
as
this
piece
I
wear
(Love
me,
love
me,
hey
hey)
They
even
iced
out
Jesus'
hair
My
last
piece,
I
swear
(Love
me,
love
me)
Lord,
this
is
the
last
time
(hehe)
Told
my
accountant,
"It's
the
last
time
I
swear
this
is
the
last
time
I
know
that
I
said
that
shit
last
time
But
this
the
last
time"
Mama
I
swear
this
is
the
last
time
So
don't
take
my
chains
from
me
This
the
last
time
'Cause
I
chose
this
slavery
This

Don't

My

Even
though
I—
On
my
way,
on
my
way,
on
my
way
down
On
my
way,
on
my
way,
on
my
way
down
You
were
the
one
that
was
tryna
keep
me
way
down
But
like
the
sun,
know
you
know
I
find
my
way
back
round
They
tell
me
I
should
fix
my
grill
‘cause
I
got
money
now
I
ain't
gon'
sit
around
and
front
like
I
ain't
thought
about
it
A
perfect
smile
is
more
appealing,
but
it's
funny
how
My
shit
is
crooked—look
at
how
far
I
done
got
without
it!
I
keep
my
twisted
grill,
just
to
show
the
kids
it's
real
We
ain't
picture
perfect,
but
we
worth
the
picture
still
I
got
smart,
I
got
rich
and
I
got
bitches
still
And
they
all
look
like
my
eyebrows:
thick
as
hell
Love
yourself,
girl,
or
nobody
will
Though
you
a
woman
I
don't
know
how
you
deal
With
all
the
pressure
to
look
impressive
and
go
out
in
heels
I
feel
for
you,
killin'
yourself
to
find
a
man
that'll
kill
for
you
You
wake
up,
put
makeup
on
Stare
in
the
mirror,
but
it's
clear
that
you
can’t
face
what’s
wrong
No
need
to
fix
what
God
already
put
his
paintbrush
on
Your
roommate
yelling,
"Why
you
gotta
take
so
long?!"
What
it's
like
to
have
a
crooked
smile
Even
though
I—
On
my
way,
on
my
way,
on
my
way
down
On
my
way,
on
my
way,
on
my
way
down
(This
crooked
smile)
You
were
the
one
that
was
tryna
keep
me
way
down
But
like
the
sun,
know
you
know
I
find
my
way
back
round
(Yeah)
To
all
the
women
with
the
flaws,
know
it's
hard,
my
darling
You
wonder
why
you're
lonely
and
your
man's
not
calling
You
keep
falling
victim
‘cause
you're
insecure
And
when
I
tell
you
that
you're
beautiful
you
can't
be
sure
‘Cause
he
don't
seem
to
want
you
back
and
it's
got
you
askin'
So
all
you
see
is
what
you
lackin',
not
what
you
packin'
Take
it
from
a
man
that
loves
what
you
got
And
baby
girl,
you
a
star,
don't
let
'em
tell
you
you're
not
Now
is
it
real?
Eyebrows,
fingernails,
hair
Is
it
real?
If
it's
not,
girl,
you
don't
care
‘Cause
what's
real
is
somethin'
that
the
eyes
can't
see
That
the
hands
can’t
touch,
that
them
broads
can’t
be
And
that’s
you,
never
let
'em
see
your
frown
And
if
you
need
a
friend
to
pick
you
up,
I’ll
be
around
And
we
can
ride
with
the
windows
down,
the
music
loud
I
can
tell
you
ain’t
laughed
in
a
while
But
I
wanna
see
that
crooked
smile
Even
though
I—
On
my
way,
on
my
way,
on
my
way
down
On
my
way,
on
my
way,
on
my
way
down
You
were
the
one
that
was
tryna
keep
me
way
down
But
like
the
sun,
know
you
know
I
find
my
way
back
round
We
got
the
crooked
smile,
we
can
style
on
'em
Back
round,
crooked
smile,
we
can
style
on
'em
You
were
the
one
that
was
tryna
keep
me
way
down
But
like
the
sun,
know
you
know
I
find
my
way
back
round
We
don't
look
nothin'
like
the
people
on
the
screen
You
know,
the
movie
stars,
picture
perfect
beauty
queens
But
we
got
dreams
and
we
got
the
right
to
chase
‘em
Look
at
the
nation
That’s
a
crooked
smile
braces
couldn’t
even
straighten
Seem
like
half
the
race
is
either
on
probation
or
in
jail
Wonder
why
we
inhale,
‘cause
we
in
Hell
already
I
ask:
If
my
skin
pale,
would
I
then
sell
like
Eminem
or
Adele?
But
one
more
time
for
the
'Ville
And
fuck
all
of
that
beef
shit,
nigga,
let’s
make
a
mil
Hey
officer
man,
we
don’t
want
nobody
gettin'
killed
Just
open
up
that
cell,
let
my
brother
outta
jail
I
got
money
for
the
bail
now,
and
well
now
If
you
askin'
will
I
tell
now—ayy,
hell
nah
I
ain’t
snitchin'
'cause,
man,
they
get
them
niggas
stitches
now
If
you
was
around
then
you
wouldn’t
need
a
witness
now
How
you
like
this
crooked
smile?
Even
though
I—
On
my
way,
on
my
way,
on
my

On

Round
Freedom
or
jail,
clips
inserted,
a

bein'
born
Same
time
my
man
is
murdered;
the
beginning
and

As
far
as
rap
go,
it's
only
natural,
I
explain
My
plateau,
and
also
what
defines
my
name
Yeah,
long
live

never

'Pac
was

Jesus,
Nas
wrote
the
Bible
Now
what
you
'bout
to
hear
is
a
tale
of
glory
and
sin
No
I.D.
my
mentor,
now
let
the
story
begin
I
used
to
print
out
Nas'
raps
and
tape
'em
up
on
my
wall
My
niggas
thought
they
was
words,
but
it
was
pictures
I
saw
And
since
I
wanted
to
draw,
I
used
to
read
them
in
awe
Then
he
dropped
Stillmatic,
rocked
the
cleanest
velour
Fast
forward,
who'd
a
thought
that
I
would
meet
him
on
tour
I'm
earnin'
stripes
now,
a
nigga
got
Adidas
galore
Backstage
I
shook
his
hand,
let
'em
know
that
he's
the
man
When
he
said
he
was
a
fan
it
was
too
hard
to
understand
No
time
to
soak
up
the
moment
though
‘cause
I
was
in
a
jam
Hov
askin'
where's
the
record
that
the
radio
could
play
And
I
was
strikin'
out
for
months,
9th
inning,
feelin'
fear
Jeter
under
pressure,
made
the
biggest
hit
of
my
career
But
at
first,
that
wasn't
clear,
niggas
had
no
idea
Dion
called
me
when
it
dropped,
sounded
sad
but
sincere
Told
me
Nas
heard
your
single
and
he
hate
that
shit
Said,
"You
the
one,
yo,
why
you
make
that
shit?"
I
can't
believe
I
let
Nas
down
Damn,
my
heart
sunk
to
my
stomach
I
can't
believe
I
let
Nas
down
I
got
defensive
on
the
phone
Resentment
was
in
my
tone,
fuck
it
Long
live
the
idols,
may
they
never
be
your
rivals
'Pac
was
like
Jesus,
Nas
wrote
the
Bible
Now
what
you're
'bout
to
hear's
a
tale
of
glory
and
sin
No
I.D.
my
mentor,
now
let
the
story
begin
I
couldn't
help
but
think
that
maybe
I
had
made
a
mistake
I
mean,
you
made
"You
Owe
Me"
Dog,
I
thought
that
you
could
relate
But
while
I
shot
up
the
charts
You
mean
tellin'
me
that
I
was
not
up
to
par
When
I
followed
my
heart
Granted,
my
heart
was
tainted
By
my
mind
that
kept
on
sayin'
"Where's
the
hits?"
You
ain't
got
none
You
know
Jay'll
never
put
your
album
out
without
none
And,
dog,
you
know
how
come
Labels
are
archaic,
formulaic
with
they
outcome
They
don't
know,
they
just
study
the
charts
Me,
I
studied
the
shows,
the
fans,
study
they
hearts
I
had
a
feelin'
I
was
killin',
and
this
music
we
were
spillin'
out
Would
change
lives
forever,
fuck
the
label,
put
it
out
Friday
Night
Lights
blew,
that
was
classic
number
two
Now
it
seemed
as
if
the
Nas
comparisons
was
comin'
true
Still
no
release
date
from
the
label,
are
they
insane?
Gucc
told
me
play
the
game
to
change
the
game
But
on
the
way
I
let
Nas
down
I
got
no
one
to
blame
I'm
ashamed,
I
let
Nas
down
But
this
is
God's
plan,
you
can
never
understand,
fuck
it
Long
live
the
idols,
may
they
never
be
your
rivals
'Pac
was
like
Jesus,
Nas
wrote
the
Bible
Now
what
you're
'bout
to
hear's
a
tale
of
glory
and
sin
No
I.D.
my
mentor,
now
let
the
story
begin
I
always
believed
in
the
bigger
picture
If
I
could
get
them
niggas
to
listen
outside
my
core
Then
I
can
open
the
door
Reintroduce
them
to
honesty,
show
'em
that
they
need
more
The
difference
between
the
pretenders
and
the
Kendrick
Lamars
And
so,
I
took
the
fall
Like
the
son
of
the
Lord
on
the
cross
Dyin'
for
that
fake
shit
you
niggas
bought
For
the
past
decade
If
I
should
pass,
please
let
this
be
my
last
essay
Therefore
I
write
from
the
heart
Apologies
to
OG's
for
sacrificin'
my
art
But
I'm
here
for
a
greater
purpose
I
knew
right
from
the
start
I'm
just
a
man
of
the
people,
not
above
but
equal
And
for
the
greater
good
I
walk
amongst
the
evil
Don't
cry,
Mama,
this
the
life
I
choose
myself
Just
pray
along
the
way
that
I
don't
lose
myself
This
is
for
the
nigga
that
said
that
Hip-Hop
was
dead
I
went
to
Hell
to
resurrect
it
How
could
you
fail
to
respect
it?
Letting
Nas
down,
I
got
the
phone
call
Quietly
I
mourned,
dog,
I
let
Nas
down
Yeah,
and
on
this
flight
May
I
never
lose
sight,
fuck
it
Long
live
the
idols,
may
they
never
be
your
rivals
'Pac
was
like
Jesus,
Nas
wrote
the
Bible
Now
what
you
just
heard's
a
tale
of
glory
and
sin
No
I.D.
my
mentor,
now
let
the
story
begin
Yeah
Hey
Spinning
in
circles,
live
my
life
without
rehearsal
If
I
died
today
my
nigga,
was
it
business,
was
it
personal?
Should
this
be
my
last
breath
I'm
blessed
cause
it
was
purposeful
Never
got
to
church
to
worship
lord
but
please
be
merciful
You
made
me
versatile,
well-rounded
like
cursive
Know
you
chose
me
for
a
purpose,
I
put
my
soul
in
these
verses
Born
sinner,
was
never
born
to
be
perfect
Sucker
for
women
licking
they
lips
and
holding
these
purses
Back
when
we
ran
the
streets
who
would
think
we'd
grow
to
be
murderers
Teachers
treated
niggas
as
if
they
totally
worthless
And
violent,
and
hopeless,
I
saw
but
never
noticed
That
a
college
point
us
right
to
"Be
all
that
you
can
be"
posters,
uh
Rest
in
peace
to
Tiffany,
I
don't
know
if
This
the
realest
shit
I
wrote,
but
know
the
realest
nigga
wrote
this
And
signed
it,
and
sealed
it
in
a
envelope
and
knew
one
day
you'll
find
it
And
knew
one
day
you'd
come
back
and
rewind
it,
singing
I'm
a
born
sinner
But
I'll
die
better
than
that,
I
swear
You
were
always
where
I
needed
you
to
be
Whether
you
were
there
or
not
there
(I
was
there)
I
was
born
sinning
But
I
live
better
than
that
(better
than
that)
If
you
ain't
fucking
with
that,
I
don't
care
(Ooh,
ooh,
ooh)
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah
Yeah,
this
music
shit
is
a
gift
But
God
help
us
make
it
'cause
this
music
bizz
is
a
cliff
I
got
her
life
in
my
grip,
she
holding
tight
to
my
wrist
She
screaming:
"Don't
let
me
slip"
She
see
the
tears
in
my
eyes,
I
see
the
fear
on
her
lips
True
when
I
told
you:
"You
the
only
reason
why
I
don't
flip
And
go
insane";
My
roof
in
the
pouring
rain
You
knew
me
before
the
fame,
don't
lose
me
the
more
I
change,
no
Just
grow
with
me,
go
broke
you
go
broke
with
me
I
smoke
you
gon'
smoke
with
me
Woman's
curse
since
birth,
man
lead
her
to
the
hearse
I
go
Bobby
you
go
Whitney
damn
Listen
here,
I'll
tell
you
my
biggest
fears
You
the
only
one
who
knows
'em
Don't
you
ever
go
expose
'em
This
life
is
harder
than
you'll
probably
ever
know
Emotions
I
hardly
ever
show,
more
for
you
than
for
me
Don't
you
worry
yourself,
I
gotta
do
this
for
me
They
tell
me
life
is
a
test,
but
where's
the
tutor
for
me?
Pops
came
late,
I'm
already
stuck
in
my
ways
Ducking
calls
from
my
mother
for
days
Sometimes
she
hate
the
way
she
raised
me
but
she
love
what
she
raised
Can't
wait
to
hand
her
these
house
keys
with
nothing
to
say
Except
I'm
a
born
sinner
But
I'll
die
better
than
that,
I
swear
You
were
always
where
I
needed
you
to
be
Whether
you
were
there
or
not
there
(I
was
there)
I
was
born
sinning
But
I
live
better
than
that
(better
than
that)
If
you
ain't
fucking
with
that,
I
don't
care
(Ooh,
ooh,
ooh)
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah
I'm
a
born
sinner
But
I'll
die
better
than
that,
I
swear
You
were
always
where
I
needed
you
to
be
Whether
you

(I

I

But

If

(Ooh,

Yeah,

out,
we're
tired
We
only
need
to
stay
close,
in
time
Sparks
will
fly
And
we
fly
too,
and
we,
and
we
And
we
fly

I
know
my
style
ain't
perfect
I
know
my
smile
ain't
perfect
Nigga
ain't
perfect,
it's
true
Funny
though
I
am
perfect
for
you
All
the
drama
seem
worth
it
for
you
She
put
up
with
the
shit
like
she
work
at
the
zoo,
true
Now
what
you
crying
for?
She
says
you
ain't
gon'
settle
down,
what
you
lyin'
for?
She
want
that
old
thing
back
Things
ain't
the
same,
think
we
both
seen
that
Love
is
war,
end
up
on
the
floor
But
baby
you
only
lose
when
you
don't
swing
back
I
say
those
words
hoping
that
You
fight
for
a
nigga
like
I
fight
for
you
Like
I
fight
temptations
every
night
for
you
And
know
I
slip,
only
girl
in
my
life
is
you
It
may
seem
like
our
fire
Has
been
a
little
burnt
out,
we're
tired
We
only
need
to
stay
close,
in
time
Sparks
will
fly
And
we
fly
too,
and
we,
and

And
we
fly

It
may

We

Sparks

And
we
fly
too,
and
we,
and
we
And
we
fly
too
Feels
as
though
our
world's
crashing
down
We
can’t
forget
to
breathe
through
this
now
We
live
through
the
ups
and
the
downs
It’ll
get
better
It
may
seem
like
our
fire
Has
been
a
little
burnt
out,
we're
tired
We
only
need
to
stay

in

Sparks
will
fly
Yeah
Still
at
it
Villematic
What
a
life
we
chose
I'm
sending
this
out
to
those
Who
fell
down,
but
then
rose
I'm
hot,
I'm
hellbound
With
these
flows,
Cole
And
when
my
story's
told
Let
it
be
know
I'd
never
fold
I
took
my
time
I
gave
my
soul
I
watched
you
shine
But
me
I
glow
So,
I'm
coming
for
what
I'm
owed
You
know?
Yeah,
hey,
Cole
world
Hey,
I
gotta
dollar
and
a
dream,
that's
all
a
nigga
got
So
if
it's
'bout
that
cream,
then
I'm
all
up
in
the
spot
I
got
a
dollar
and
a
dream,
just
a
dollar
and
a
dream
Cole,
walk
with
a
nigga,
I
give
you
my
pain
So
much
on
my
mind,
I
wonder
how
it
fit
in
my
brain
Scattered
thoughts,
dark
secrets
lead
me
to
a
blacker
heart
Life
can't
get
any
worse,
Stevie
with
his
glasses
off
'Cause
I
still
don't
see
hope,
lookin'
for
a
quick
fix
When
everyone
I
see
is
broke,
get
lost
in
weed
smoke
Knowin'
it
make
it
worse,
thoughts
roam
uncontrollably
Barely
trustin'
niggas,
over
a
decade
they
been
knowin'
me
Shit,
life
at
the
bottom,
nobody
but
God
got
em'
They
say
he
wouldn't
leave
me,
yet
I'm
fallin'
like
it's
Autumn
Tell
me,
what
do
you
do
just
when
you're
on
your
last
dollar
And
the
stress
of
this
mess
you
in
can
make
your
ass
holla?
Do
you
fold,
grow
bitter
and
grow
cold?
No
longer
fightin',
now
the
only
thing
you
grow
is
old
Or
do
you
flip
that
fuckin'
dollar
to
a
dream?
Whether
a
scholar
or
a
fiend,
watch
a
pawn
become
a
king
Cole!
Young
nigga
with
his

Nice
guy,
just
got
a
mean
flow
Never
seen
rich
but
he's
seen
poor
Mr.
Dollar
and
a
Dream
in
case
she
know
That's
all
a
nigga
got
So
if
it's
'bout
that
cream,
then
I'm
all
up
in
the
spot
I
got
a
dollar
and
a
dream,
just
a
dollar
and
a
dream
Yeah,
armed
and

Ya

I'm
on
mine
You
logged
off
'cause
I'm
online,
small
talk
from
small
minds
I
wanna
buy
the
mall
but
there
ain't
shit
in
this
small
town
This
where
I
get
my
dough
My
niggas
make
sure
the
money
right
and
then
I
rip
the
show
I
run
the
town
they
tried
to
call
me
underground
I
spun
around
like,
you
wish
Homie
my
backpack
Louis,
now
watch
just
how
I
do
this
I
got
the
nerds
rappin'
hard
shit,
dummies
rappin'
smart
shit
Mozart
meets
Humphrey
Bogart
with
this
from
the
heart
shit
Play
your
part,
life
is
but
a
dream
for
me
I
get
a
flash
of
nightmares
when
niggas
scheme
on
me
It's
hard
to
see
my
enemies,
who
infiltrated
my
team
I
take
a
step
back
and
notice
that
things
ain't
what
they
seem
That's
when
a
nigga
refocus,
yeah
I
turn
on
them
high
beams
I
got
that
red
dot
waitin',
I'm
wastin'
your
whole
regime
I
wish
a
nigga
would,
boy
you
can't
out-smart
me
I
let
you
feel
like
you
the
shit,
but
boy
you
can't
out-fart
me
Ya
never
have
it,
I
know
you
want
what
I
got
But
nigga
you
ain't
me,
but
you
are
what
I'm
not
And
that's
a
phony
ass,
lonely
ass,
Cole
is
what
you
know
me
as
But
we
far
from
homies,
if
you
know
my
mama,
you
know
me
If
ya
don't
then
well
I'm
sorry,
you
should
get
to
know
Kay
Man
she
been
workin'
too
hard,
I
should
send
her
a
bouquet
My
goal
this
year
is
a
real
one,
gonna
stack
a
million
And
as
soon
as
I
do,
Mama
that
9
to
5
is
through
And
I
know
I
ain't
been
callin',
but
I'm
thinkin'
'bout
you
And
all
the
shit
that
you
been
through
My
girl
and
then
my
brother
too
'Cause
this
life
gets
hard
on
this
road,
yeah
it's
true
I
don't
never
tell
you
how
much
I
be
stressin',
but
I
do
But
I
suck
it
up
for
who?
my
fans,
and
my
mans
Who
probably
never
ever
had
this
type
of
lifestyle
in
they
plans
Hoppin'
in
and
out
of
vans,
on
the
buses,
on
the
planes
Gettin'
brain
from
a
bitch
and
thinkin'
"Goddamn,
what's
her
name?"
Sometimes
I
just
shake
my
head
and
tell
myself
this
is
a
shame
And
then
my
other
side
kick
in
like,
"Bitch,
don't
be
so
fuckin'
lame"
Dang,
what
a
life,
another
day,
another
night
At
times
this
shit
is
all
blurry,
pray
and
hope
that
God
heard
me
Just
for
those
prayin'
for
me,
man
I
know
that
y'all
worry
But
I
ain't
never
failed
and
you
can
bet
I
never
will

So

Is

So
I

And
about
just
who
we
really
are
And
where
we've

how
we
still

"Baby,

at
how
we
live
broke
on
the
boulevard"
But
all
she
ever
want
me
to
do
is
unhook
her
bra
Then
all
I
really
want
is
for
her
to
go
down
low
Before
you
know
it,
she
wet
enough
to
get
drowned
slow
And
all
that
deep
shit
I
was
previously
down
fo'
Replaced
by
freak
shit
I
am
currently
down
fo'
You
see
I
peeped
it,
pussy
is
power
That
proud
feelin'
we
get
knowin'
that
pussy
is
ours
And
how
it
feels
to
feel
that
feelin'
You
feelin'
when
you
be
drillin'
that
shit
Got
her
sayin'
you
be
killin'
that
shit
And
all
the
pain
the
world
cause,
she
be
healin'
that
shit
And
naw,
that
ain't
your
girl,
dog
But
you
be
feelin'
that
chick
And
you
just
wanna
tell
her
everything
she
might
need
But
in
the
meantime
it's
lights,
please
Lights
please,
lights
please,
turn
off
the
lights
For
now,
everything
just
seems
so
right
And
how
you
make
the
darkness
seem
so
bright
I'm
feeling
like
things
gon'
be
alright
Lights
please,
lights
please,
turn
off
the
lights
For
now,
everything
just
seems
so
right
And
how
you
make
the
darkness
seem
so
bright
I'm
feeling
like
things
gon'
be
alright
So
now
we
in
the
hotel,
mirrors
on
the
ceilin'
She
say
she
wanna
blow
L's,
I
hear
her
and
I'm
willin'
But
every
time
I
smoke,
well,
a
nigga
mind
gone
So
that
every
word
I
spoke,
well,
I'm
tryna
put
her
on
But
she
couldn't
hear
me
I
told
her
all
about
how
we
been
livin'
a
lie
And
that
they
love
to
see
us
all
go
to
prison
or
die
Like,
"Baby,
look
at
how
they
show
us
on
the
TV
screen"
But
all
she
ever
want
me
to
do
is
unzip
her
jeans
Then
all
I
really
want
is
for
her
to
get
on
top
Before
you
know
it,
she
workin',
jerkin'
it
nonstop
And
all
that
next
shit
I
was
previously
talkin'
Is
now
that
wet
shit
that
I'm
currently
lost
in
And
while
that
sweat
drip,
I
am
reminded
All
the
times
my
brother
told
me
that
pussy
is
blindin'
I'm
findin',
the
more
I
grow
The
more
y'all
seem
to
stay
the
same
Don't
even
know
the
rules,
but
yet
y'all
tryna
play
the
game
And
ain't
it
shameful
how
niggas
blame
hoes
for
givin'
birth
To
a
baby
that
took
two
to
make?
Coward
nigga,
you
a
fake
How
you
gonna
look
in
your
son's
face
and
turn
your
back
Then
go
start
another
family?
Dawg,
what
type
of
shit
is
that?
She
said
it's
okay,
rub
my
head
and
told
me
to
relax
Laid
a
nigga
down
proper,
like
she
was
recordin'
tracks
Said
"I
know
you
wanna
change
the
world
But
for
the
night,
please
Just
reach
over
and
hit
the
lights
please"
Lights
please,
lights
please,
turn
off
the
lights
For
now,
everything
just
seems
so
right
And
how
you
make
the
darkness
seem
so
bright
I'm
feeling
like
things
gon'
be
alright
Lights
please,
lights
please,
turn

For

how

Lights

ah-ah-ah
Lights
please,
ah-ah-ah
Lights

ah-ah-ah
Lights

turn
off
the
lights
Lights,

Alright,
if
y'all
niggas
heard
the
first
one,
The
Come
Up
and
shit,
then
you
would
have
heard
part
1
of
this
joint
right
here.
It's
"Dead
Presidents",
you
know
classic
nigga,
that's
classic
Jay
shit.
So
I
did
it,
threw
it
on
the
first
mixtape,
this
is
about
a
year
ago.
We
let
niggas
hear
like
you
know
the
mixtape
whatever,
and
there
was
always
this
one
nigga
that
stuck
out
to
me
like
a
year
ago.
This
nigga's
like
"yo".
like
I
thought
I
did
my
thing
on
this
shit,
that
was
like
two
of
my
favorite
verses
that
I
did,
but
he
was
just
like
"Yo",
like,
"Yo
you
didn't
come
right
man.
If
you
gon'
come
on
Dead
Presidents
son,
you
gotta
come,
hard
son,
you
gotta
come
harder
than
that
son,
you
gotta
come
harder
than
that."
I
was
like,
man
what
you
mean
I
came
hard?
But,
that
shit
always
stuck
in
my
mind,
so
doing
this
next,
you
know,
doing
this
The
Warm
Up
I
was
like,
damn,
I
gotta
get
on
it
again,
I
gotta
do
it
again.
Just
almost
like,
just
to
prove
to
that
nigga
and
kinda
prove
to
myself
that
you
I
can,
I
can
maybe
get
a
little...
I'm
drivin',
nigga
as
soon
as
I
get
the
text
we
all
in
the
car
like,
"Ahh,
yeah
nigga,
we
out
here
nigga,
yeah
nigga!!"
So
we
goin'
crazy,
we
goin'
crazy
as
fuck,
we
like
super
excited.
Dog,
ten
seconds
later,
all
I
see
in
the
back
and
hear
is
"woop
woop,"
blue
lights
right
behind
me,
the
fuckin'
undercover
car,
of
all
things.
So
I'm
like
fuck.
I
knew
right
away
what
it
was.
Dawg,
for
the,
for
two
and
a
half
maybe
three
years
before
that,
in
New
York,
I
was
drivin'
dirty,
my
license
was
no
good.
Dawg,
how
'bout
the
moment
I
found
out
I
was
gon'
get
the
deal
a
fuckin'
cop
got
behind
me
and
I
already
knew
what
it
was.
I
handled
it
so
like,
I
handled
it
the
best
way
you
could
ever
go
to
jail
like
I
went
to
jail
knowin',
bitch
like,
ah
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
I'm
in
there
dog,
spendin'
the
night
in
jail
realizin',
like,
these
niggas
have
no
clue,
bitch
I'm
'bout
to
sign
this
shit
(laughs).
That
was
the
easiest
night
in
jail
a
nigga
could
ever
do,
son
I
put
my
heart
and
soul
in
this
game,
I'm
feelin'
drained
Unappreciated,
unalleviated
Tired
of
comin'
up
short—fuck
abbreviated
Want
my
whole
name
spelled
out,
my
own
pain
spilled
out
No
pain,
no
gain,
I
blow
brains—Cobain
Throw
flames,
Liu
Kang,
the
coach
ain't
help
out,
so
I
call
my
own
shots
I'm
David
Blaine,
I'm
breakin'
out
of
my
own
box,
you
stay
the
same
But
homie
if
you
change,
may
you
change
for
the
better
Back
when
Martin
King
had
a
thing
for
Coretta
Wonder
if
she
seen
all
the
dreams
he
was
dreamin'
Did
she
have
a
clue
of
all
the
schemes
he
was
schemin'
Still
loved
him
just
enough
to
put
up
with
the
cheatin'
Months
go
by
and
only
see
him
for
a
weekend
I
say
a
prayer—hope
my
girl
ain't
leavin'
We
all
got
angels,
we
all
got
demons
As
you
fall
through
the
club
Bad
bitches
down
to
do
all
the
above
Money
comes
fast
so
bein'
hungry
don't
last
Till
you
look
in
the
mirror
and
you
saw
who
you
was
Cole
World—it
couldn't
be
more
clearer
The
time
is
now—couldn't
be
more
here-er
My
reign
gonna
last
like
3-4
eras
Say
hello
to
the
real,
I
can
be
your
hero
Hey,
I'ma
put
us
all
on
the
map
Gone
and
I
ain't
lookin'
back
I
know
they
gone
feel
it
like
they
tank
on
E
I
promise
baby,
you
can
bet
the
bank
on
me
Cause
can't
nobody
tell
me
what
I
ain't
gonna
be
no
more
You
thinking
I'ma
fall,
don't
be
so
sure
I
wish
somebody
made
guidelines
On
how
to
get
up
off
the
sidelines
Up
in
1st
class,
laugh
even
though
it's
not
funny
See
a
white
man
wonder
how
the
fuck
I
got
money
While
he
sit
at
coach,
hate
to
see
me
walk
past
'im
Young
black
pants
sag,
headphones
blastin'
Know
what
he
askin',
"how
did
he
manage?"
"With
all
the
cards
against
him,
he
used
them
to
his
advantage!"
Slang
we
be
speakin'
probably
soundin'
like
Spanish
Then
I
fuck
they
heads
up
when
a
nigga
show
manners
Some
New
York
niggas
thought
it
was
funny
callin'
us
'Bama
Laughin'
at
the
grammar
cause
they
didn't
understand
us
Must've
thought
we
slow,
but
little
do
they
know
I
came
up
in
here
to
take
advantage
of
that
shit
y'all
take
for
granted
Opportunity
that
I
would
kill
for
Lookin'
at
rappers
like
"what
the
fuck
you
got
a
deal
for?!"
When
I
was
assed
out
with
my
funds
low
It's
nice
to
know
I
had
the
whole
world
at
my
front
door
Hey,
I'ma
put
us
all
on
the
map
Gone
and
I
ain't
lookin'
back
I
know
they
gone
feel
it
like
they
tank
on
E
I
promise
baby,
you
can
bet
the
bank
on
me
Cause
can't
nobody
tell
me
what
I
ain't
gonna
be
no
more
You
thinking
I'ma
fall,
don't
be
so
sure
I
wish
somebody
made
guidelines
On
how
to
get
up
off
the
sidelines
I
made
it
to
the
rock,
even
though
they
tried
to
box
me
out
I
got
the
key
to
the
game,
they
tried
to
lock
me
out
But
what
they
don’t
understand
is
this
is
all
plan
It’s
a
bigger
picture
and
you
can’t
photoshop
me
out
Some
nigga
ask
me
why
Jay
never
shout
me
out
Like
I’m
supposed
to
give
a
fuck
Don’t
you
know
that
I
be
out
in
France
Where
the
fans
throw
they
hands
like
Pacquiao
Not
cause
my
looks,
cause
my
hooks
could
knock
Rocky
out
And
my
lines
is
designed
from
the
heart
Young
Simba
been
a
lion
from
the
start
Dumb
nigga’s,
y’all
been
lyin
from
the
start
My
life’s
like
a
movie,
truly
And
these
niggas
is
dyin'
for
the
part
But,
you’ll
never
play
me
like
LeBron
vs.
Jordan
Twenty
years,
wonder
who
they
gone
say
was
more
important
Both
changed
the
game,
came
through
and
made
a
lane
Who’s
to
say
that
who’s
greater,
all
we
know,
they
ain’t
the
same
Hey,
I'ma
put
us
all
on
the
map
Gone
and
I
ain't
lookin'
back
I

feel

I
wish

On

Hey...

All

Have

Have

If
I

be
so
thick?
Guess

game
in
a
headlock
I'm
blasting
that,
I'm
laughing
at

Don't

White
Sox,

It

lot,
my
chain
and

They

on
black,
I
ain't
never
been
a
high-roller
Now
it's
racks
on
racks,
never
thought
that
I
would
ride
Rover
But
I'm
back
on
track,
add
to
the
fact
that
I
never
really
drive
sober
Cole
World
but
I'm
hot
as
shit,
do
that
mean
that
I'm
bipolar?
Young,
black
and
gifted,
I
rap
like
it's
Christmas
Eve
Coach
wouldn't
let
a
nigga
off
the
bench
Now
wonder
why
I
didn't
quit
the
team,
but
I'm
cut
from
a
different
sleeve
Cole
World
'til
the
wrist'll
freeze
Hurry
up
with
your
pictures
please,
I
gotta
make
history
It
cost
me
a
lot,
my
chain
and
my
watch
They
say
time
is
money,
but
really
it's
not
If
we
ever
go
broke
girl,
then
time
is
all
we
got
And
you
can't
make
that
back,
no,
you
can't
make
that
back
So
let's
ball
while
we
here,
let's
ball
while
we
here
Like
ain't

tomorrow,
like
ain't

next
year
Drink
away
all
our
problems,
make
it
rain
with
no
care
Like
I'll
make
that
back,

that
back,

Ugh,

up)
Ugh,
nice
watch
(I

Ugh,

No

Mr.
Nice
Guy
Hello,
Mr.
Nice
Watch
Yeah,

got
a
Hublot,

call
it
Tebow
I

bitch
with
a
gator
band
Y'all

half-time,

the
Gator
band
Y'all
niggas

a
time

Who
got
these
niggas

wound
up?
Cocksucker,
I'm
730
Y'all

where
y'all
niggas
gonna
wind

No
more
Mr.
Nice
Guy,
hello
Mr.
Nice
Watch
Only
but
a
matter
of
time
'fore
I
hit
yall
niggas
with
a
nice
shot
Y'all
niggas
better
not
call
the
law
Get
no
blood
on
my
Audemar
Meaning
y'all
better
not
waste
my
time
When
y'all
ready
I
take
you
all
to
war
Meanwhile
I'm
just
chopping
off
doors
Put
the
front
on
the
back,
cause
I'm
back
and
forth
Put
the
front
on
the
back
of
the
'Bach
like
a
boss
So
I'm
fronting
on
niggas
when
I'm
backing
off
What
up,
Cole?
It's
your
time,
let's
these
niggas
know
Adjust
your
Rollie
on
these
motherfucking
hoes
Whenever
you
ready,
go
It
cost
me
a
lot,
my
chain
and
my
watch
If
we
ever
go
broke
girl,
then
time
is
all
we
got
(Ugh,
nice
watch)
I
think
it's
gonna
be
a
hell
of
a
night,
a
hell
of
a
night
So
we
could
do
whatever
you
like
(Like,
like,
like...)
Hey,
hey!
It
took
me
all
day
to
find
some
inspiration
It
just
hit
me
like
a
ton
of
bricks,
no
renovation
Problem
with
the
game
now,
there
ain't
no
innovation
I
see
my
shit
all
in
your
shit,
we
call
that
imitation
And
they
say
that's
flattering,
but
I
ain't
flattered
at
all
Matter
fact
y'all
need
to
practice
that
more
See
my
man
Nate
asked
me
if
I
gained
weight
I
said
nah,
my
pockets
got
fatter,
that's
all
Money
was
an
issue,
but
now
that
that's
solved
I
ball,
I
ball,
like
Kobe
in
the
fall
Put
trophies
on
wall,
rather
trophies
on
my
mantle
Dog
my
shows
be
off
the
handle
Take
the
proceeds
go
to
gamble
Ha,
bet
it
on
black
and
pray,
I
quadruple
my
salary
If
I
win,
maybe
then
I
could
pay
Sallie
Mae
Told
her
I
be
dealin'
with
some
real-life
shit
She
be
askin'
"When?",

hey!
Uh,

up
the
808's
for
me
(Woohoo!)
Back
when
I
was
starvin'
no
one

a
plate
for
me
(Woohoo!)
Now
I

it
big
and
that's
my
day
to
day
story
(Woohoo!)
I
got
the
type
of
shit
that
make
a
hater
say
sorry
Bitch,

the
crib,
watchin'
Belly
Eatin'

They

patience

a
virtue
I'm
goin'
all
out
and

I
never
had
a
curfew
See,
when
you're
spittin'
so
real
Suddenly
these
phony
niggas
lose
they
appeal
Got
em'
feelin'
like
my
niggas
when
they
lose,
they
appeal
Then
it's
back
to
the
cell,
back
to
the
hell
At
times
I
watch
the
news
and
see
they
talkin'
'bout
diplomacy
And
they
ain't
got
a
clue
my
niggas
ain't
got
they
diplomas,
see
Rappers
show
me
love,
I
wonder
what
it
could
be
I
think
they
scared
of
me,
and
they
should
be
Cole

We

And

And

Patron
God

You

my
intentions
with
you
was
clear
I'm
learnin'
not
to
judge
a
woman
by
the
shit
that
she
wear
Therefore
you
shouldn't
judge
a
nigga
off
the
shit
that
you
hear
Get
all
defensive,
apprehensive,
all
because
my
career
To

each

and

Somehow
I
wound
up
in
your
bed
so
where
we
headed
from
here?
Just
say
you're

But

Tomorrow

'Cause

Cook

Then
I

way,
you

about
me
all
day
That's
just
a
warnin'
And

I
hit
it
in
the
mornin'?
Can
I
hit
it
in
the
mornin'?
Can
I
hit
it
in
the
mornin'?
The
Sun
risin'
while
you
moanin'
Can
I
hit
it
in
the
mornin'?
Can
I
hit
it
in
the
mornin'?
And
can
I
hit
it

the
mornin'?
The
Sun
risin'
while
you
moanin',
yeah
Uh-uh,

One,

Uh-uh,

One,

Baby
girl,
I
can't
imagine
what
it's
like
for
you
I
got
you
pregnant,
now
inside
there
is
a
life
in
you
I
know
you
wonderin'
if
this
is
gon'
make
me
think
'bout
wifin'
you
Like,
if
you
have
my
first
child
Would
I
spend
my
whole
life
with
you?
Now,
I
ain't
tryna
pick
a
fight
with
you,
I'm
tryna
talk
Now,
I
ain't
tryna
spend
the
night
with
you,
I'm
kinda
lost
See,
I've
been
givin'
it
some
thought
lately
And
frankly
I
feel
like
we
ain't
ready
and
this—
Hold
up
now,
let
me
finish!
Think
about
it,
baby,
me
and
you,
we
still
kids
ourself
How
we
gonna
raise
a
kid
by
ourself?
Handle
biz
by
ourself?
A
nigga
barely
over
twenty
Where
the
hell
we
gon'
live?
Where
am
I
gon'
get
that
money?
I
refuse
to
bring
my
boy
or
my
girl
in
this
world
When
I
ain't
got
shit
to
give
'em,
and
I'm
not
with
them
niggas
Who
be
knockin'
girls
up
and
skate
out
So,
girl,
you
gotta
think
about
how
the
options
weigh
out
What's
the
way
out?
And
I
ain't
too
proud
to
tell
you
That
I
cry
sometime,
I
cry
sometimes
about
it
And
girl,
I
know
it
hurt,
but
if
this
world
was
perfect
Then
we
could
make
it
work,
but
I
doubt
it
And
I
ain't
too
proud
to
tell
you
That
I
cry
sometime,
I
cry
sometimes
about
it
And
girl,
I
know
it
hurt,
but
if
this
world
was
perfect
Then
we
could
make
it
work,
but
I
doubt
it

"Nigga,
you
got
some
nerve
To
come
up
to
me
talkin'
about
abortion
This
my
body,
nigga,
so
don't
think
you
finna
force
shit!
See,
I
knew
that
this
is
how
you
act,
so
typical
Said
you
love
me,
oh,
but
now
you
flippin'
like
reciprocals
It
figures
though,
I
should've
known
That
you
was
just
another
nigga
No
different
from
them
other
niggas
Who
be
claimin'
that
they
love
you
just
to
get
up
in
them
drawers
Knowin'
all
the
right
things
to
say
I
let
you
hit
it
raw,
mothafucka!
Now
I'm
pregnant,
you
don't
wanna
get
involved,
mothafucka?
Tryna
take
away
a
life—is
you
God,
mothafucka?!
I
don't
think
so!
This
a
new
life
up
in
my
stomach
Regardless
if
I'm
your
wife,
this
new
life
here,
I'ma
love
it
I
ain't
budgin',
I
just
do
this
by
my
mothafuckin'
self
See,
my
mama
raised
me
without
no
mothafuckin'
help
From
a
man,
but
I
still
don't
understand
how
you
could
say
that
Did
you
forget
all
those
conversations
that
we
had
way
back
'Bout
your
father?
And
you
told
me
that
you
hate
that
nigga
Talkin'
about
he
a
coward
and
you
so
glad
that
you
ain't
that
nigga
‘Cause
he
left
your
mama
when
she
had
you
and
he
ain't
shit
And
here
you
go
doin'
the
same
shit…
You
ain't
shit,
nigga!"
And
I
ain't
too
proud
to
tell
you
That
I
cry
sometimes,
I
cry
sometimes
about
it
And
boy,
this
shit
hurts,
and
ain’t
nobody
perfect
Still
we
can
make
it
work,
but
you
doubt
it
And
I
ain't
too
proud
to
tell
you
That
I
cry
sometimes,
I
cry
sometimes
about
it
And
boy,
this
shit
hurts,
and
ain’t
nobody
perfect
Still
we
can
make
it
work,
but
you
doubt
it
They
say
everything
happens
for
a
reason
And
people
change
like
the
seasons,
then
grow
apart
She
wanted
him
to
show
his
heart
and
say
he
loved
her
He
spoke
the
magic
words
and
on
the
same
day
he
fucked
her
Now
she
wide
open
She'd
put
a
ring
up
on
his
finger
if
she
could
But
he
loved
her
‘cause
the
pussy
good
But
she
ain't
no
wife
though
Uh-oh!
She
tellin'
him
she
missed
her
period,
like
typos
He
panickin',
froze
up
like
a
mannequin,
a
life
grows
Inside
her,
and
now
he
askin':
"Is
it
even
mine?"
What
if
this
bitch
ain't
even
pregnant?
Dog,
could
she
be
lyin'?
And
she
be
cryin',
‘cause
he
actin'
distant
Like,
"Ever
since
I
told
you
this,
nigga,
you
actin'
different."
And
all
his
niggas
sayin',
"Man,
these
hoes
be
trappin'
niggas
Playin'
with
niggas'
emotions
like
they
some
action
figures."
Swear
they
get
pregnant
for
collateral,
it's
like
extortion
Man,
if
that
bitch
really
pregnant,
tell
her
to
get
a
abortion
(Uh)
But
what
about
your
seed,
nigga?
(Uh-uh)
But
what
about
your
seed,
nigga?
But
what
about
your
seed,
nigga?
But
what
about
your
seed,
nigga?
And
I
ain't
too
proud
to
tell
you
That
I
cry
sometime,
I
cry
sometimes
about
it
And
I
ain't
too
proud
to
tell
you
That
I
cry
sometime,
I
cry
sometimes
about
it
Ay,

Your

Smokin'

Sweatin'

Hey,

Remember

D'wana
Now

over
Rihannas
I'm

Timbs
and
sweaters
And
we
always
argue
'bout
the
same
thing
And
tell
me,
why
we
gotta
argue
about
the
same
thing,

man?
Nobody's

Nobody's

Nobody's

Nobody's

We

He

to
go
inside
and
I
love
to
go
all
night
and
We

the
boat:
Poseidon
I

Yeah,

eh
Oh

to
my
college
girl:
Take
the
weekend
off
and
come
home
soon
I
graduated
way
too
long
ago
to
be
sneakin'
all
in
your
dorm
room
But
that
thing
tight
like
Fort
Knox
So
I
call
you
when
the
tour
stops
But
baby,
where
your
roommates?
Did
you
make
sure
the
door's
locked?
She
love
it
when
we
get
together
Smoke
a
little
weed,
put
her
shit
together
Now
that
I'm

I
can
pick
and
choose
Only
fuck

hoes
who
got
shit
to

Yeah,
I
heard
the
stories
'bout
different
dudes
Her
man
on
campus,
but
it's
fine
by
me
She
say
she
only
fucked
like
four–five
niggas
So
you
know
you
gotta
multiply
by
three
Nobody's
perfect,
uh
Nobody's
perfect,
ay
ay,

Hey,
but
you're
perfect
for
me
Nobody's

(Ay,

Nobody's
perfect,
ay
Hey,
but
you're
perfect
for
me
We
rollin',
we
ridin'
He
like
to
go
inside
and
I
love
to
go
all
night
and
We
rock
the
boat:
Poseidon
I
love
to
call
your
name,
name,
name
Yeah,
baby,
I
love
to
call
your
name,
name,
name,
eh
Yeah,
what's
up
girl?
Angel
eyes,
long
hair,
I
see
you
cryin',
what's
wrong
there
"He
did
what?
He
fucked
who?",
we
know
the
story,
what's
new?
See
I
could
probably
rush
you,
tell
you
that
he
shoulda
loved
you
Take
advantage,
fuck
you,
tell
you
I'll
do
all
the
shit
he
wouldn't
do
But
the
truth
is,
we
all
the
same,
on
different
teams,
but
it's
all
a
game
The
objective,
tryna
score,
you
got
a
wife,
you
find
a
whore
You
fuck
her
fast,
she
find
her
drawers,
pull
up
her
pants,
you
find
the
door
You
drive
her
home,
she
mop
you
off,
you
bust
again,
and
drop
her
off
Then
repeat
like
an
episode;
why
we
cheat,
I'll
never
know
Is
it
cause
we
rap?
Heavens
no,
lotta
niggas
rap
though,
never
blow
Like
heterosexuals,
girl
you
fine,
from
head
to
toe
Could
it
be
cause
my
father
let
me
know
that
he
cheated
and
somehow
I
never
told,
I
never
told
Father:
Hey
you
wanna
be
a
man?
Son:
Yeah
I
wanna
be
a
man
Father:
A
man
don't
run
and
tell
his
mama
everything
he
see
Son:
I
ain't
gon'
tell
Father:
Alright,
alright
then
man,
be
a
man
then
Son:
Alright
Ok,
that's
what
it
is,
I
see
the
game,
the
hoes
come,
the
seasons
change
The
hoes
go,
we
rearrange,
fuck
up
her
life,
she'll
never
be
the
same
The
OG's
that
beat
the
game,
forever
young,
Peter
Pan
35?
Still
playing;
Child
support?
Still
paying
Juggling,
bill
paying,
been
running
round,
field
daying
Wine
and
dine,
meal
paying,
with
hopes
that
she'll
lay
in
The
bed
and,
get
wet
then,
give
head
then,
you
bet
man
The
same
girl
who
said
we
just
met
man,
game
colder
than
the
fucking
dead
man
One
night
stands,
no
best
man,
no
bridesmaids
or
Reverends
Cause
Wolverine's
depressed
and
don't
wanna
be
your
ex-man
Cause
Cupid
aims
and
throw
the
darts,
there
go
the
sparks
and
broken
hearts
Who
wanna
build
Noah's
Ark
just
to
have
that
shit
torn
apart?
Wife:
You
know
what?
I
need
to
talk
to
you
Husband:
About
what?
Wife:
I
don’t
think
this
is,
working
out
for
us
Husband:
Why?
Wife:
I
mean,
I
need
some
space.
I
mean
no,
I
just
wanna
find
myself,
that’s
all
Husband:
What
the
fuck?!”
Wife:
You
know?
There's
a
nigga
right
now
somewhere
He
at
the
table
with
a
bowl
of
Apple
Jacks
And
he's
reading
the
back
of
the
cereal
And
in
between
eating
the
Apple
Jacks
he's
writing
some
shit
And
he
wants
my
spot
I'mma
find
him
though,
I'mma
sign
him..
I
don't
want
no
problems
Like
we
always
do
at
this
time,
Cole
blowin'
your
mind
Hey
dummy,
this
no
accident,
all
of
this
was
designed
Took
my
time,
crept
from
behind
And
I
opened
up
your
blinds,
rise
and
shine,
Cole
World
Same
nigga

to
drive

In
my

I'm

tryna

I
ain't
like
you
lame
ass
niggas,
boy
I
spit
it
how
I
live
it
So
when
you
see
me
in
the
streets,
man
I
ain't
gotta
mimic
'Cause
I
ain't
got
an
image
to
uphold,
this
real
shit
I
ain't
got
a
gimmick,
I
just
flow,
the
niggas
went
nuts
for
The
boy
that
set
fire
to
the
booth
In
a
game
full
of
liars,
it
turns
out
that
I'm
the
truth
Some
say
that
rap's
alive,
it
turns
out
that
I'm
the
proof
'Cause
the
ones
y'all
thought
would
save
the
day
can't
even
tie
my
boots
The
ones
y'all
thought
could
hang
with
me
can't
even
tie
my
noose
Let
these
words
be
my
bullets,
nigga,
I
don't
rhyme,
I
shoot,
bang!
Before
I
wake
I
pray
to

Hope
my

Jamaica
before
she

I
hoop
was
never

enough
to
ever

But
these
words
I
record
got
me
ballin',

More

this
a
natural
disaster
Boy,
I'm
meaner

Gina,
"Shut

Real

of
livin'

Is
Cole

Y'all

the
same

That's
how
I
feel
about
it,
mama

real
addict
That's
why
I
don't
respect
that
lyin'
ass
white
shit

Cole's
planning
funerals,

The

But

Medal
of
honor,
I'm
feelin'

Pac
When
he
slept
with
Madonna,
hey,

is
death
before
dishonor
Get
arrested
and
forget
to
tell
my
mama
She
got
enough
to
stress
about,
my
niggas
gonna
get
me
out
Then
we
hit
the
club
with
the
thugs
and
the
liquors
No
criminal
record
but
I'm
makin'
criminal
records
Isn't
it
ironic?
Isn't
it
iconic?
Jacket
so
expensive
you
wouldn't
even
try
on
it
But
it
fit
me
perfect,
I
purchase
it
if
I
want
it
The
city
on
my
shoulder,
so
no

you
can't
cry
on
it
When
you

greatest
aye,

Maybe

set
It

Son

If
I

die
before
I
wake
I
pray
to
the
Lord
my
soul
to
take
My

Reign

Two

Hell

Put

Lookin'

Every

could
be
my

Ever
since
I
got

I’ve
been
on
a
mission
to
fuck

Woman,

Ha,

Ha,

your

drive
you

Older
hoes
sayin'
"My
how
you’ve
grown"
I
came
up,
fucked
the
game
up
Show
my
momma
I’ll
survive
on
my
own
Did
you
miss
me?
I
don't
know
where
I'm
goin'
But
I'm
goin',
now
is
you
comin'

Up,

Mothafucker
this
is
God’s
gift
Yeah
Yeah
Look,
I
just
shed
tears
homie
and
no
I
ain't
too
proud
to
admit
it
Just
seen
my
father
for
the
first
time
in
a
minute
When
I
say
a
minute
I
mean
years
man
Damn,
a
whale
could
have
swam
in
them
tears
fam
Cause
as
I
left
em'
I
reflected
on
my
younger
days
When
it
was
just
me
and
my
brother
and
my
mother
played
Father,
‘cause
no
other
man
bothered
Not
even
my
biological,
it
never
seemed
logical
But
I
accepted
it
'cause
I
ain't
know
no
better
Thought
I
was
brighter
than
a
Polo
sweater
No
pops
was
like
Martin
with
no
Coretta
So
many
things
you
could
have
told
me
And
saved
me
the
trouble
of
letting
my
mistakes
show
me
I
feel
like
you
barely
know
me
And
that's
a
shame
‘cause
our
last
name
is
the
same
That
blood
type
flowing
through
our
veins
is
the
same
My
mama
left
you
and
it
may
be
that
anger's
to
blame
But
that's
no
excuse,
only
you
and
God
know
the
truth
And
why
you
only
call
monthly,
barely
ever
saw
me
Spend
some
summers
with
you
and
played
with
my
cousin
Maury
Maybe
I
should
be
telling
you
“fuck
you”
‘cause
you
selfish
But
I
want
a
father
so
bad,
I
can't
help
but...
Break
down
I
break
down
Can't
help
but
break
down
I
break
down
Yeah,
I
never
thought
I'd
see
my
mama
on
that
shit,
man
It's
fucking
with
her
body,
now
she
sick,
damn
I
wanted
a
big
house
with
a
white
picket
fence
and
a
pool
Who
would
have
ever
thought
that
it
would
come
to
this,
man?
Quicksand
is
what
this
life
feel
like
That
shit
these
rappers
kick
is
nothing
like
real
life
You
made
a
milli
off
of
serving
hard
white?
Yeah

My
mama

you
what
addicted
to
that
pipe
feel
like
Stupid
niggas,

the
cops

shooting

I

to
God,

I

Can't

His

By

Ain't

doubt

sure
But
temptation
stays
round
And
if
she
strayed,
how
could
he
ever
know?
Never

And
so,

A

Don’t

But

'Cause

I
can’t

your

ma'am
I

what's
on
your
brain
You
probably
hoped
it
never
would
end
Like,
“Is
it
the
real
thing
Or
is
it
just
a
one-night
stand?”
Well
then
Let
me
see
you
get

Now,

won't
you

She

big
ol'
chains
Ridin'
around

in
a

Range
I

Now

Would

I

Just

it
Man,

Rebounds

I
caught

I

her:
“Baby

Know
I
run
the
town
even
when
I
ain't
from

And
I

just
to
show
up
at
this
party
I
made
what
yo'
nigga

year
That's

life,
take
a
chance,
roll
the
dice
Money

Don’t

And

Your

Speaking

Real

My
life
accelerated,
but
had
to
wait
my
turn
Then
I
redecorated,
that

my
tables
turned
Live
life,
might
as
well,
only
way
to
learn
Is
try
and
fail,
clientele
the
only
way
to
earn
So

I

All

And
I
don't

that's
where
we

A

bad
Good
chick,
alone,
mad
as
fuck,
she
done
had
enough
I

tryna
raise
my
status

But

Ass
fat

with
a
little
ol'
waist
I
ain't
want
the
whole
meal,
just
a
little
ol'
taste
Should
have
looked
both
ways
fore
I
crossed
you
I
guess
I
never
thought
I
could
have
ever
have
lost
you
Now
I'm

While

nigga
learnin'
all
the
shit
I
taught
you
Damn,
guess
you
deserve
that,
a
new
start
But
deep
down
you
know
we
grew
apart,
long
before
I
broke
your
heart
If
I
lost
your
respect,
I'm
just
hopin'
you
don't
look
at
me
as
you
somethin'
you
regret
I
tried,
you
tried,
we
tried
All
of
the
times
that
we
had
together
We
should've
known
nothing

(Can't

try
tho,
can't
say
we
didn't
try,
hey)
I
got
your
message
I
been
meanin'
to
respond,
know
it's
been
a
while
Apologies,
I
ain't
been
around
I
wanna
kick
it,
but
I
know
that
shit
is
different
now
And
times
have
changed
Let
me
know
if
I'm
out
of
bounds,
are
the
lines
the
same
?
I
mean
ya,
lookin'
good,
yeah
you
still
got
it
Been
reminiscin'
and
I'm
not
sure
how
I
feel
about
it
Now
we
can
say
that
all
good
things
come
to
an
end
But
we
know
each
other
way
too
well
to
pretend
We
went
from
friends
to
somethin'
much
more
To
breakin'
up
to
makin'
up
and
fuckin'
once
more
Second
chances,
we
gave
enough
'Til
finally
we
gave
it
up,
but
some
days
I
be
wakin'
up
and
wantin'
one
more
But
what
for?
Maybe
it's
just
the
weather
We
break
each
others
heart's,
so
maybe
it's
for
the
better
Holler
whenever,
cause
you
always
got
a
friend
in
me
And
nothin'
lasts
forever,
least
we
got
these
memories
I
tried,
you
tried,
we
tried
All
of
the

that
we
had
together
We
should've

(Can't

tho,
can't

we
didn't
try,
hey)
It
was
always
me
vs
the
world
Until
I
found
it's
me
vs
me
Why,

Why,

Just

Earth

many
times
And
I
am
telling
you
once
again
Just
to
remind
you,
sweetheart
That
my—
Oh,
Lamar
Hail
Mary
and
marijuana,
times
is
hard
Pray
with
the
hooligans,
shadows
all
in
the
dark
Fellowship
with
demons
and
relatives,
I'm
a
star
Life
is
one
funny
mothafucka
A
true
comedian,
you
gotta
love
him,
you
gotta
trust
him
I
might
be
buggin',
infomercials
and
no
sleep
Introverted
by
my
thoughts;
children,
listen,
it
gets
deep
See,
once
upon
a
time
inside
the
Nickerson
Garden
projects
The
object
was
to
process
and
digest
poverty's
dialect
Adaptation
inevitable:
gun
violence,
crack
spot
Federal
policies
raid
buildings
and
drug
professionals
Anthony
was
the
oldest
of
seven
Well-respected,
calm
and
collected
Laughin'
and
jokin'
made
life
easier;
hard
times,
mama
on
crack
A
four-year-old
tellin'
his
nanny
he
needed
her
His
family
history:
pimpin'
and
bangin'
He
was
meant
to
be
dangerous
Clocked
him
a
grip
and
start
slangin'
Fifteen,
scrapin'
up
his
jeans
with
quarter
pieces
Even
got
some
head
from
a
smoker
last
weekend
Dodged
a
policeman,
workin'
for
his
big
homie
Small-time
hustler,
graduated
to
a
brick
on
him
10,000
dollars
out
of
a
project
housing,
that's
on
the
daily
Seen
his
first
mil
twenty
years
old,
had
a
couple
of
babies
Had
a
couple
of
shooters
Caught
a
murder
case,
fingerprints
on
the
gun
they
assumin'
But
witnesses
couldn't
prove
it
That
was
back
when
he
turned
his
back
and
they
killed
his
cousin
He
beat
the
case
and
went
back
to
hustlin'
Bird-shufflin',
Anthony
rang
The
first
in
the
projects
with
the
two-tone
Mustang
That
5.0
thing,
they
say
5-0
came
Circlin'
parking
lots
and
parking
spots
And
hoppin'
out
while
harrassin'
the
corner
blocks
Crooked
cops
told
Anthony
he
should
kick
it
He
brushed
'em
off
and
walked
back
to
the
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
See,
at
this
chicken
spot
There
was
a
light-skinned
nigga
that
talked
a
lot
With
a
curly
top
and
a
gap
in
his
teeth
He
worked
the
window,
his
name
was
Ducky
He
came
from
the
streets,
the
Robert
Taylor
Homes
Southside
Projects,
Chiraq,
the
Terror
Dome
Drove
to
California
with
a
woman
on
him
and
500
dollars
They
had
a
son,
hopin'
that
he'd
see
college
Hustlin'
on
the
side
with
a
nine-to-five
to
freak
it
Cadillac
Seville,
he'd
ride
his
son
around
on
weekends
Three-piece
special
with
his
name
on
the
shirt
pocket
'Cross
the
street
from
the
projects,
Anthony
planned
to
rob
it
Stuck
up
the
place
before,
back
in
'84
That's
when
affiliation
was
really
eight
gears
of
war
So
many
relatives
tellin'
us,
sellin'
us
devilish
works
Killin'
us,
crime,
intelligent,
felonious
Prevalent
proposition
with
9's
Ducky
was
well-aware
They
robbed
the
manager
and
shot
a
customer
last
year
He
figured
he'd
get
on
these
niggas'
good
sides
Free
chicken
every
time
Anthony
posted
in
line
Two
extra
biscuits,
Anthony
liked
him
and
then
let
him
slide
They
didn't
kill
him;
in
fact,
it
look
like
they're
the
last
to
survive
Pay
attention,
that
one
decision
changed
both
of
they
lives
One
curse
at
a
time
Reverse
the
manifest
and
good
karma,
and
I'll
tell
you
why
You
take
two
strangers
and
put
'em
in
random
predicaments
Give
'em
a
soul
so
they
can
make
their
own
choices
and
live
with
it
Twenty
years
later,
them
same
strangers,
you
make
'em
meet
again
Inside
recording
studios
where
they
reapin'
their
benefits
Then
you
start
remindin'
them
about
that
chicken
incident
Whoever
thought
the
greatest
rapper
would
be
from
coincidence?
Because
if
Anthony
killed
Ducky,
Top
Dawg
could
be
servin'
life
While
I
grew
up
without
a
father
and

And

I'll
prolly
die
'cause
that's
what
you
do
when
you're
17
All
worries
in
a
hurry,
I
wish
I
controlled
things
If
I
could
smoke
fear
away,
I'd
roll
that
mothafucker
up
And
then
I'd
take
two
puffs

been
hungry
all
my
life)

(Pull

Now
When
I
was
27,
I
grew
accustomed
to
more
fear
Accumulated
10
times
over
throughout
the
years
My
newfound
life
made
all
of
me
magnified
How
many
accolades
do
I
need
to
block
denial?
The
shock
value
of
my
success
put
bolts
in
me
All
this
money,
is
God
playin'
a
joke
on
me?
Is
it
for
the
moment,
and
will
he
see
me
as
Job?
Take
it
from
me
and
leave
me
worse
than
I
was
before?
At
27,
my
biggest
fear
was
losin'
it
all
Scared
to
spend
money,
had
me
sleepin'
from
hall
to
hall
Scared
to
go
back
to
Section
8
with
my
mama
stressin'
30
shows
a
month
and
I
still
won't
buy
me
no
Lexus
What
is
an
advisor?
Somebody
that's
holdin'
my
checks
Just
to
fuck
me
over
and
put
my
finances
in
debt?
I
read
a
case
about
Rihanna's
accountant
and
wondered
How
did
the
Bad
Girl
feel
when
she
looked
at
them
numbers?
The
type
of
shit'll
make
me
flip
out
and
just
kill
somethin'
Drill
somethin',
get
ill
and
fill
ratchets
with
a
lil'
somethin'
I
practiced
runnin'
from
fear,
guess
I
had
some
good
luck
At
27
years
old,
my
biggest
fear
was
bein'
judged
How
they
look
at
me
reflect
on
myself,
my
family,
my
city
What
they
say
'bout
me
reveal
if
my
reputation
would
miss
me
What
they
see
from
me
would
trickle
down
generations
in
time
What
they
hear
from
me
would
make
'em
highlight
my
simplest
lines
I'm
talkin'
fear,
fear
of
losin'
creativity
I'm
talkin'
fear,
fear
of
missin'
out
on
you
and
me
I'm
talkin'
fear,
fear
of
losin'
loyalty
from
pride
'Cause
my
DNA
won't
let
me
involve
in
the
light
of
God
I'm
talkin'
fear,
fear
that
my
humbleness
is
gone
I'm
talkin'
fear,
fear
that
love
ain't
livin'
here
no
more
I'm
talkin'
fear,
fear
that
it's
wickedness
or
weakness
Fear,
whatever
it
is,
both
is
distinctive
Fear,
what
happens
on
Earth
stays
on
Earth
And
I
can't
take
these
feelings
with
me,
so
hopefully,
they
disperse
Within
fourteen
tracks,
carried
out
over
wax
Searchin'
for
resolutions
until
somebody
get
back
Fear,

Verse
2
says,
"You
only
have
I
known
of
all
the
families
of
the
Earth,
therefore
I
will
punish
you
for
all
your
iniquities."
So
until
we
come
back
to
these
commandments
Until
you
come
back
to
these
commandments
We
gonna
feel
this
way,
we
gonna
be
under
this
curse
Because
He
said
He's
gonna
punish
us
The
so-called
Blacks,
Hispanics,
and
Native
American
Indians
Are
the
true
children
of
Israel
We
are
the
Israelites,
according
to
the
Bible
The
children
of
Israel
He's
gonna
punish
us
for
our
iniquities,
for
our
disobedience
Because
we
chose
to
follow
other
gods
That
man
chastens
his
son,
so
the
Lord,
thy
God,
chasten
thee
So,
just
like
you
chasten
your
own
son,
He's
gonna
chastise
you
Because
He
loves
you,
so
that's
why
we
get
chastised
That's
why
we're
in
the
position
that
we're
in
Until
we
come
back
to
these
laws,
statutes,
and
commandments
And
do
what
the
Lord
says,
these
curses
is
gonna
be
upon
us
We
gonna
be
at
a
lower
state
in
this
life
that
we
live
Here,
in
today,
in
the
United
States
of

I
love
you,

I

Yesterday
I
got
a
call
like
from
my
dog
like
101
Said
they
killed
his
only
son
because
of
insufficient
funds
He
was
sobbin',
he
was
mobbin',
way
belligerent
and
drunk
Talkin'
out
his
head,
philosophin'
on
what
the
Lord
had
done
He
said:
"K-Dot,
can
you
pray
for
me?
It
been
a
fucked
up
day
for
me
I
know
that
you
anointed,
show
me
how
to
overcome."
He
was
lookin'
for
some
closure
Hopin'
I
could
bring
him
closer
To
the
spiritual,
my
spirit
do
know
better,
but
I
told
him
"I
can't
sugarcoat
the
answer
for
you,
this
is
how
I
feel:
If
somebody
kill
my
son,
that
mean
somebody
gettin'
killed."
Tell
me
what
you
do
for
love,
loyalty,
and
passion
of
All
the
memories
collected,
moments
you
could
never
touch
I'll
wait
in
front
a
nigga's
spot
and
watch
him
hit
his
block
I'll
catch
a
nigga
leavin'
service
if
that's
all
I
got
I'll
chip
a
nigga,
then
throw
the

in

Compulsive

lost
Barack

never

him
again
But
is
America
honest,
or
do
we
bask

sin?
Pass

mix
it

Then
bash

Crippin'

I'll
ask
again—oops,
accident
It's
nasty
when

Then
roll

then
bet

But
pride’s

Me,
I
wasn't
taught

but
care
In
another

I
surely
was
there
Me,
I
wasn't
taught
to
share,
but
care
I
care,
I
care
Hell-raising,
wheel-chasing,
new
worldy
possessions
Flesh-making,
spirit-breaking,
which
one
would
you
lessen?
The
better
part,
the
human
heart,
you
love
’em
or
dissect
'em
Happiness
or
flashiness?
How
do
you
serve
the
question?
See,
in
a
perfect
world,
I
would
be
perfect,
world
I
don't
trust
people
enough
beyond
they
surface,
world
I
don't
love
people
enough
to
put
my
faith
in
man
I
put
my
faith
in
these
lyrics,
hoping
I
make
a
band
I
understand
I
ain't
perfect,
I
probably
won't
come
around
This
time
I
might
put
you
down
Last
time
I
ain't
give
a
fuck,
I
still
feel
the
same
now
My
feelings
might
go
numb,
you're
dealing
with
cold
thumb
I’m
willing
to
give
up
a
leg
and
arm
to
show
empathy
from
Pity
parties
and
functions
of
you
and
yours
A
perfect

you
probably
live
another

can’t
fake

Me,

In

I
surely

Me,
I
wasn't

I
care,
I

Maybe
I
wasn’t
there
Maybe
I
wasn't
there
Maybe
I
wasn't
there
Maybe
I
wasn't
there
Now,
in
a
perfect
world,
I
probably
won't
be
insensitive
Cold
as
December
but
never
remember
what
winter
did
I
wouldn't
blame
you
for
mistakes
I
made
or
the
bed
I
laid
Seems
like
I
point
the
finger
just
to
make
a
point
nowadays
Smiles
and
cold
stares,
the
temperature
goes
there
Indigenous
disposition,
feel
like
we
belong
here
I
know
the
walls,
they
can
listen,
I
wish
they
could
talk
back
The
hurt
becomes
repetition,
the
love
almost
lost
that
Sick
venom
in
men
and
women
overcome
with
pride
A
perfect
world
is
never
perfect,
only
filled
with
lies
Promises
are
broken
and
more
resentment
come
alive
Race
barriers
make
inferior
you
and
I
See,
in
a
perfect
world,
I'll
choose
faith
over
riches
I'll
choose
work
over
bitches,
I'll
make
schools
out
of
prison
I'll
take
all
the
religions
and
put
'em
all
in
one
service
Just
to
tell
'em
we
ain't
shit,
but
He's
been
perfect,

Me,
I
wasn't

In

Ooh,

The

Fill

The

Born
inside

checked
out
in
second
grade
When
I
was
9,
on
cell,
motel,
we
didn’t
have
nowhere
to
stay
At
29,
I've
done
so
well,
hit
cartwheel
in
my
estate
And
I'm
gon'
shine

I’m
supposed
to,
antisocial
extrovert
And
excellent
mean
the
extra
work
And
absentness
what
the
fuck
you
heard
And
pessimists
never
struck
my
nerve
And
Nazareth
gon'
plead
his
case
The
reason
my
power's
here
on
earth
Salute
the
truth,
when
the
prophet
say
I-I
got
loyalty,
got
royalty
inside
my
DNA
This
is
why
I
say
that
hip
hop
has
done
more
damage
to
young
African
Americans
than
racism
in
recent
years
I
got
loyalty,
got
royalty
inside
my
DNA
I
live
a
better
life,
I'm
rollin'
several
dice,
fuck

I

Sex,

Is
it
wickedness?
Is
it
weakness?
You
decide
Are
we
gonna
live
or
die?
So
I
was
takin'
a
walk
the
other
day
And
I
seen
a
woman—a
blind
woman
Pacin'
up
and
down
the
sidewalk
She
seemed
to
be
a
bit
frustrated
As
if
she
had
dropped
somethin'
and
Havin'
a
hard
time
findin'
it
So
after
watchin'
her
struggle
for
a
while
I
decide
to
go
over
and
lend
a
helping
hand,
you
know?
"Hello
ma'am,
can
I
be
of
any
assistance?
It
seems
to
me
that
you
have
lost
something
I
would
like
to
help
you
find
it."
She
replied:
"Oh
yes,
you
have
lost
something
You've
lost…
your
life."
{Gunshot}
Is
it
wickedness?
Lamar
stated
his

With

in
the
song,
quote:
"And

Oh

Come

Oh,

A

then
I
heard
"What

I
fell
to
my
knees,
pulled
out
my
resume
That
dated
back
to
June
17th,
1987
My
paperwork
was
like
a
receipt
I
was
valedictorian,
I
was
fearful
of
judgment
But
confident
I
had
glory
in
all
my
past
endeavors
Close
my

pray
to
God
that
I
live

Dark

lady,
ya
know,
when
I
went
back
home.
I
was
tryna
spit
my
best
game
to
her,
you
know,
give
her
my
best
cap,
but
she
kept
on
snapping
her
fingers
like
*snaps*.
I
said
"You
know
what,
girl?
You
crazy."
Then
she
asked
me
what
he
said...
(What
did
the
Asian
say?)
"A
peace
of
mind"
That's
what
the
Asian
said—I
need
a
divine
Intervention
was
his
religion
and
I
was
surprised
Him
believing
in
Buddha,
me
believing
in
God
Asked
him
what
are
you
doing,
he
said
"taking
my
time"
Meditation
is
a
must,
it
don't
hurt
if
you
try
See
you
thinking
too
much,
plus
you
too
full
of
yourself
Worried
about
your
career,
you
ever
think
of
your
health?
(What
did
the
Indian
say?)
"A
piece
of
land"
That's
what
the
Indian
said—I
needed
the
man
Telling
me
longevity
is
in
the
dirt
Should
buy
some
property
first
Should
profit
a
better
dollar
with
generational
perks
Equity
at
his
best,
really,
you
should
invest
These
tangible
things
expire,
don't
you
expect
Income
with
so
much
outcome
and
yes
Look
at
my
heritage,
we
blessed
(Now,
what
the
black
man
say?)
"A
piece
of
pussy"
That's
what
the
black
man
said
I
needed
to
push
me
To
the
limit,
to
satisfy
my
hunger
We
do
it
all
for
a
woman
from
haircut
to
a
war
We
like
to
live
in
the
jungle,
like
to
play
in
the
peach
What
you
saying
to
me?
He
said
"nigga,
come
back
to
reality
for
a
week"
Pussy
is
power,
fuck
on
a
new
bitch
every
night
I
wouldn't
be
prouder,
you
should
allow
it
(What
the
white
man
say?)
A
piece
of
mine's
That's
what
the
white
man
wanted
when
I
rhyme
Telling
me
that
he
selling
me
just
for
$10.99
If
I
go
platinum
from
rapping,
I
do
the
company
fine
What
if
I
compromise?
He
said
it
don't
even
matter
You
make
a
million
or
more,
you
living
better
than
average
You
losing
your
core
following,
gaining
it
all
He
put
a
price
on
my
talent,
I
hit
the
bank
and
withdraw
Hit
the
bank
and

Put
myself
in
the
rocket
ship
and
I
shot
for
the
stars
"Look
at

you
accomplishing";
what
he
said
to
the
boy
"I'ma

you
some
promises
that
you
just
can't
ignore
Your

I
holler,

I'm

How

I
can

when
I

See
I'm
livin'
with
anxiety,
duckin'
the

Fuckin'

I

Once
upon
a
time
I
used
to
go

and
talk

God
Now
I'm
thinkin'
to
myself,
hollow
tips

I

Now
I'm
drinkin'
by
myself,
at
the

parked
Watch
you
when
you
walk
inside
your
house
You
threw
your
briefcase
all
on
the

I
plan
on
creeping
through

door
and
blowin'
out

piece
of
your

until
your

Cut

He
drove
alone,
with
a
bottle
of
his
own
grippin'
the
handle
Lit
off
Henny,
I'm
tryna
dismantle
These
wicked
ways,
I've
engaged
in
such
a
gamble
'Cause
I
could
speak
the
truth
and
I
know
the
world
would
unravel,
wait
That's
a
bit
ambitious
maybe
I'm
trippin'
Maybe
I'm
crazy,
maybe
I
exist
in
a
different
dimension
Not
to
mention
when
I
close
my
eyes
I
see
the
distance
It's
such
a
scary
sight
so
I
rarely
go
to
sleep
at
night
I
watch
the
sun
rise
then
I
watch
the
sun
fall
Studied
the
son
of
God
and
still
don't
recognize
my
flaws
I
guess
I'm
lost,
the
cost
of
being
successful
is
equal
to
being
neglectful
I
pray
my
experience
helps
you
As
for
me
I'm
tryna
sort
it
out
Searching
for
loopholes
in
my
bruised
soul
But
who
knows?
I
just
need
a
little
space
to
breathe
I
know
perception
is
key,
so
I
am
king
The
other
side
has
never
mortified
my
mortal
mind
The
borderline
between
insanity
is
father
time
I
fall
behind
my
skeleton,
they
tell
me
that
I'm
blind
I
know
that
I'm
intelligent,
my
confidence
just
died
Carpe
diem,
seize
the
day,
I
can't
compromise
A
tapeworm
couldn't
cure
this
gluttonous
appetite
A
couple
trinkets,
they
seein'
me
as
I
pacify
But
couldn't
fathom
the
meaning
of
seein'
sacrifice
I'm
passin'
lives
on
a
daily,
maybe
I'm
losing
faith
Genocism
and
capitalism
just
made
me
hate
Correctionals
and
these
private
prisons
gave
me
a
date
Professional
dream
killers
reason
why
I'm
awake
I'm
sleepwalkin',
I'm
street
stalkin',
I'm
outta
place
Reinforcing
this
heat
barking,
these
are
the
brakes
Before
I
blink
do
I
see
me
before
them
pearly
gates?
Or
this
is
just
a
mirage
or
a
facade?
Wait
These
metamorphic
supernatural
forces
dominate
what
I
see
A
Gemini,
duality
personalities
always
conflicted
me
Oh!
But
don't
be
scared
of
me,
girl
I
can
explain
I
know
it's
foreign
to
you
I
know
it's
hard
to
believe
God
give
me
the
favor
Let
me
explain
More
than
a
compliment
And
I
could
use
some
assistance,
let
me
show
you
how
I
can
explain
Oh
shando!
I
spin
around
two
times
I'll
be
there
with
the
answer
Let
me
explain
I'm
bizarre,
avant-garde
Both
sides
of
me
are
evenly
odd
It's
attractive,
you're
intrigued
Am
I
mortal
man
or
make
believe?
Anything
you
want
I
can
explain
I
can
explain
it
Any
misunderstandings,
baby
Let
me
explain
I
can
explain
it
Why
don't
you
sit
and
talk
to
me?
I
can
explain
Let
me
explain
it,
ah
yeah
Let
me
explain
My
mama
told
me
that
I
was
different
the
moment
I
was
invented
Estranged
baby,
no
I'm
not
ashamed
I
recommend
every
inch
of
your
lunatic
ways
Praise
the
lord,
you
teach
the
kids
how
to
be
themself
and
plenty
more
You
know
the
male
species
can
be
redundant
I
mean
we
love
a
woman
and
think
we
can
satisfy
her
Between
sheets,
covers
and
pillows
I'm
promising
your
lack
of
tolerance
stuck
on
a
zero
I'm
promising
that
I'm
acknowledging
you
as
my
hero
Cause
you
believe
in
me
No
you're
not
easily
impressed
But
I
possess
qualities
that
you
need
to
see
Look
at
my
flaws,
look
at
my
flaws
Look
at
my
imperfections
in
awe
Look
how
you
unique
that
my
mystique
is
a
round
of
applause
And
yours
equally
valued
You
stick
out
like
an
alien
compared
to
those
around
you
And
that's
alright
because
I
like
it
You
and
me
are
the
same
Hopefully
I'm
invited,
hopefully
you
don't
change
Because
I
know
for
sure
who
you
are
I
can
explain
Your
mama
raised
you,
your
daddy
raised
you
Hand
washing
your
clothes
on
Sunday
Let
me
explain
Walking
your
brother
to
school,
three
miles
away
To
feed
his
body
and
soul
I
can
explain
Don't
you
explain
that,
don't
you
explain
the
reason
why
your
mind,
it
travels
Let
me
explain
I
wanna
know
what
you
think
I
wanna
pick
your
brain
when
I
see
you
But
don't
you
ever
Let
me
explain
Oh
shando!
I
spin
around
two
times
A
blessing
in
disguise
I
can
explain
I
know
for
sure
who
you
are
You're
the
goddess
of
the
odd
I
am
yours
I
can
explain
I
am
yours
I
am
yours
I
am
yours
I

Our

Kendrick
at

Came
in
the
game
with
a
plan
of
beatin'
the
odds
What
an
accomplishment,
broken
promises
Kept
my
focus
anonymous
till
I
dealt
with
the
consequence
The
greatest,
the
latest
mogul,
you
know
what
time
it
is
You
niggas
fear
me
like
y'all
fear
God
You
sound
frantic,
I
hear
panic
in
your
voice
Just
know
the
mechanics
of
making
your
choice
and
writin'
your
bars
Before
you
poke
out
your
chest,
loosen
your
bra
Before
you
step
out
of
line
and
dance
with
the
star
I
could
never
end
a
career
if
it
never
start
The
murderous
capital,
avenues
lookin'
like
evil
dead
zombies
With
batteries
to
the
head
The
flattery
of
watchin'
my
stock
rise
The
salary,
the
compensation
tripled
my
cock
size
I
run
through
these
stop
signs
with
no
brake
fluid
Just
premium
gas,
do
it
for
dolo
Crash
markets
and

look
at
my
photo
Black
excellence,
pessimist
died
countin'
my

Hope
it's
evident
that
I
inspired
a

emcees
to

I
blew
cheddar

Why
so
sad?
Walking
around
with
them
blue
faces
She
said
I’m
down
on
my
luck
And
it’s
something
I
gotta
have
Blue
faces
I
hit
the
bank
today
and
told
them
color
me
bad
Blue
faces
Get
that
new
money,
and
it’s
breaking
me
down
honey
Two
tears
in
the
bucket
I
cry
with
you
But
I
could
never
lie
with
you
I
could
never
afford
not
to
afford
I
could
never
put
my
plans
to
the
side
with
you
I
could
never
see
a
red
light
Like
a
deer
with
a
headlight
I
freeze
up
when
I
re-up
See
I
barely
have
patience
And
you're
relating
Only
the
moment
to
complete
us
Why
you
hate
to
work
for
it?
The
reason
I
never
went
to
work
for
it
See
a
nine
to
five
was
so
jive
turkey
But
when
Thanksgiving
came
that
check
didn’t
hurt
me
You
plead
the
fifth
I
read
the
Fifth
Amendment
We
both
criminals
with
bad
intentions
They
say
time
heals
all
But
if
I
can
shortcut
My
success,
Corvettes
by
tomorrow
Wait
a
minute!
Now,
why
you
so
sad?
Walking
around
with
them
blue

She
said
I’m

honey
My
home
girl
got
a
credit
card
scam
She
got
a
scholarship
to
college
but
she
don’t
give
a
damn
Intuition
got
a
broke
bitch
wishin'
She
tell
me
this
on
the
phone
with
the
noodles
in
the
pan
I
know
you,
woman,
I
console
you,
woman
You
feel
like
the
universe
owes
you,
woman
Oh
the
anticipation,
of
hoping
you
could
make
it
Bitches
don't
prosper
chasing
education
But
you're
talented,
and
can't
handle
it
And
your
homegirls
can't
be
your
manager
365
times
four,
plus
more
If
you
can't
get
it
right,
tell
me,
do
you
got
the
stamina?
But
shit,
ain't
no
money
like
fast
money
Even
today
I'm
considered
a
crash
dummy
A
rapper
chasing
stardom,
how
can
I
fast
forward?
My
accolades
better
than
all
them
Why
you
so
sad?
Walking

She

I
wrote
this
song
looking
at
a
broke
home
baby
You
know
the
poverty
stricken
the
little
broke
boy
and
babies
Somebody
yell
"Kendrick
American,
they
sho’
is
crazy"
And
I
said
“why?”
Then
he
looked
me
in
the
eye,
and
said
"nigga
you
fucked
up"
You’re
banking
on
good
luck,
you
wishing
for
miracles
You
never
been
through
shit,
you’re
crying
hysterical
You
settle
for
everything,
complain
about
everything
You
say
you
sold
crack,
my
world
amphetamine
Your
projects
ain’t
shit,
I
live
in
a
hut
bitch
I'm
living
to
keep
warm,
you
living
to
pay
rent
I
prayed
my
way
through
by
waiting
on
Allah
You
played
your
way
through,
by
living
in
sci-fi
Bullshitting
yourself,
you
talking
to
strangers
Same
thing
goes
for
the
ones
you
came
with
When
y'all
came
on
the
boat
looking
for
hope
And
all
you
can
say
is
that
you’re
looking
for
dope
These
days
ain’t
no
compromise
And
your
pain
ain’t
mines
half
the
time
A
brand
new
excuse
ain’t
shit
to
me
Bitch,
I
made
my
moves,
with
shackled
feet
Cape
Town
In
today's
day
and
age
we
practice
the
self
pity
of
taking
the
easy
way
out
You
wait
on
them,
him
and
her
But
when
a
blessing
takes
too
long,
that's
when
you
go
wrong
You
selfish
motherfucker
Why
so
sad?
Walking

A

Forty

Everybody's

Bitin'

Me,

No,

Be

Truthfully

You

So

Rollies

Somebody
told
me
you
thinkin'
'bout

I
should've
listened

Oh

And
once
upon
a
time,
in
a
city
so
divine
Called
West
Side
Compton,
there
stood
a
little
nigga
He
was
five
foot
something,
God
bless
the
kid
Took
his
homie
to
the
show
and
this
is
what
they
said
"Fuck

I
'posed
to
do
when
I'm
lookin'
at
walkin'
licks?
The
constant
big
money
talk
'bout
the
mansion
and
foreign
whips
The
private
jets
and
passport,
presidential

Gold
bottles,
gold

givin'
up
the

One

My

Quickly

It's

Diamonds?
No

When
I

'em,
put

Now

But
it's

Now
I
can
watch
his
watch
on
the
TV
and
be
okay
But
see
I'm
on
the
clock
once
that
watch
landin'

LA
Remember

from
the

when
our
pride
was
low
Lookin'
at
the
world
like,
"Where
do
we
go?"
Nigga,
and
we
hate
po-po
Wanna
kill
us
dead
in
the
street
fo
sho'
Nigga,
I'm
at
the
preacher's
door
My
knees
gettin'
weak,
and
my
gun
might
blow
But
we
gon'
be
alright
Nigga,
we
gon'
be
alright
Nigga,
we
gon'
be
alright
We
gon'
be
alright
Do
you
hear
me,
do
you
feel
me?
We
gon'
be
alright
Nigga,
we
gon'
be
alright
Huh?
We
gon'
be
alright
Nigga,
we
gon'
be
alright
Do
you
hear
me,
do
you
feel
me?
We
gon'
be
alright
I
keep
my
head
up
high
I
cross
my
heart
and
hope
to
die
Lovin'
me
is
complicated
Too
afraid
of
a
lot
of
changes
I'm
alright,
and
you're
a
favorite
Dark
nights
in
my
prayers
I
remembered
you
was
conflicted
Misusing
your
influence,
sometimes
I
did
the
same
Abusing
my
power,
full
of
resentment
Resentment
that
turned
into
a
deep
depression
Found
myself
screamin'
in
the
hotel
room
I
didn't
wanna
self-destruct
The
evils
of
Lucy
was
all
around
me
So
I
went
runnin'
for
answers
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
ohhhh,
ohh
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
ohhhh,
ohh
(Breathing)
What's
wrong,
nigga?
I
thought
you
was
keeping
it
gangsta
I
thought
this
what
you
wanted
They
say
if
you
scared,
go
to
church
But
remember,
he
knows
the
Bible
too
Now,
baby,
when
I
get
you,
get
you,
get
you,

you
I'ma
go
hit
the
throttle
with
you
Smoking,
lokin',
poking
that
doja
'til
I'm
idle
with
you
'Cause

you)
Now,
baby,
when
I'm
riding
here,
I'm
riding
dirty
Registration
is
out

Smoking,
lokin',
drinking
that
potion,
you
can
see
me
swerving
'Cause
I
(want
you)
(I
want
you
more
than
you
know)
I
remember
you
took
me
to
the
mall
last
week,
baby
You
looked
me
in
my
eyes
about
four,
five
times
'Til
I
was
hypnotized,
then
you
clarified
That
I
(want
you)
You
said
Sherane
ain't
got
nothing
on
Lucy
I
said,
"You
crazy?"
Roses
are
red,
violets
are
blue
But
me
and
you
both
pushing
up
daisies
if
I
(want
you)
Now,
baby,
when
I
get
you,
get
you,
get
you,
get
you
I'ma
go

Smoking,

'Cause

You
said
to
me,
you
said
your
name
was
Lucy
I
said,
"Where's
Ricardo?"
You
said,
"Oh,
no,
not
the
show"
Then
you
spit
a
little
rap
to
me
like
this
When
I
turned
twenty-six,
I
was
like,
"Oh,
shit"
You
said
to
me,
I
remember
what
you
said
too,
you
said:
"My
name
is
Lucy,
Kendrick,
you
introduced
me,
Kendrick
Usually
I
don’t
do
this
but
I
see
you
and
me,
Kendrick
Lucy
give
you
no
worries,
Lucy

stories
About

It's

I'm
at

accordingly
Kendrick,
Lucy
don't

when
Lucy

Father
I'm

I
loosely

on
your

of

Lucy

I
want
you
to

that
Lucy

All

And

Ten

cracked
The

You
admitted
it

I

that
resembled
my

Nappy

gap
in
his

Hand-me-down

bounced
through
the

Run

He
looked
at
me
and
said,
"Kendrick,
you
do
know
my
language
You
just
forgot
because
of
what
public
schools
had
painted
Oh,
I
forgot,
'Don't
Kill
My
Vibe',
that's
right,
you're
famous
I
used
to
watch
on
Channel
5,
TV
was
taken
But
never
mind,
you're
here
right
now,
don't
you
mistake
it
It's
just
a
new
trip,
take
a
glimpse
of
your
family's
ancestor
Make
a
new
list
of
everything
you
thought
was
progress
And
that
was
bullshit
I
know
your
life
is
full
of
turmoil
Spoiled
by
fantasies
of
who
you
are,
I
feel
bad
for
you
I
can
attempt
to
enlighten
you
without
frightenin'
you
If
you
resist,
I'll
back
off
quick,
go
catch
a
flight
or
two
But
if
you
pick
destiny
over
rest
in
peace
Then
be
an
advocate,
tell
your

especially
To

From

Ain't

Red

deuce-deuce
14
years

going
hard,
like

On

Everybody

Who

realest
and
who
wack,
or
who

Critics

Motherfucker,

Don’t

No,

'Less
you
askin'
me
about
power,
yeah,
I
got
a
lot
of
it
I'm
the
only
nigga
next
to
Snoop
that
can
push
the
button
Had
the
Coast
on
standby
“K.
Dot,
what
up?
I
heard
they
opened
up
Pandora’s
box”
I
box
‘em
all
in,
by
a
landslide
Nah
homie
we
too
sensitive,
it
spill
out
to
the
streets
I
make
the
call
and
get
the
coast
involved
then
history
repeats
But
I
resolved
inside
that
private
hall
while
sitting
down
with
Jay
He
said
"it's
funny
how
one
verse
could
fuck
up
the
game"
I
been
A-1
since
day
one,
you
niggas
boo
boo-
I
remember
you
was
conflicted
Misusing
your
influence
Sometimes
I
did
the
same
Abusing
my
power
full
of
resentment
Resentment
that
turned
into
a
deep
depression
Found
myself
screaming
in
a
hotel
room
I
didn't
want
to
self-destruct
The
evils
of
Lucy
was
all
around
me
So
I
went
running
for
answers
Until
I
came
home
But
that
didn't
stop
survivors
guilt
Going
back
and
forth
Trying
to
convince
myself
the
stripes
I
earned
Or
maybe
how
A-1
my
foundation
was
But
while
my
loved
ones
was
fighting
a
continuous
war
Back
in
the
city
I
was
entering
a
new
one
How
much
a
dollar
really
cost?
The
question
is
detrimental,
paralyzin'
my
thoughts
Parasites
in
my
stomach
keep
me
with
a
gut
feeling,
y'all
Gotta
see
how
I’m
chillin'
once
I
park
this
luxury
car
Hopping
out
feeling
big
as
Mutombo
"20
on
pump
6,"
dirty
Marcellus
called
me
Dumbo
20
years
ago,
can't
forget
Now
I
can
lend
him
a
ear
or
two
How
to
stack
these
residuals
tenfold
The
liberal
concept
of
what
men'll
do
"20
on
6,"
he
didn't
hear
me
Indigenous
African
only
spoke
Zulu
My
American
tongue
was
leery
Walked
out
the
gas
station
A
homeless
man
with
a
semi-tan
complexion
Asked
me
for
ten
rand,
stressin'
about
dry
land
Deep
water,
powder
blue
skies
that
crack
open
A
piece
of
crack
that
he
wanted,
I
knew
he
was
smokin'
He
begged
and
pleaded
Asked
me
to
feed
him
twice,
I
didn't
believe
it
Told
him,
"Beat
it"
Contributin'
money
just
for
his
pipe—I
couldn't
see
it
He
said,
"My
son,
temptation
is
one
thing
that
I've
defeated
Listen
to
me,
I
want
a
single
bill
from
you
Nothin'
less,
nothin'
more"
I
told
him
I
ain't
have
it
and
closed
my
door
Tell
me;
how
much
a
dollar
cost?
It's
more
to
feed
your
mind
Water,
sun
and
love,
the
one
you
love
All
you
need,
the
air
you
breathe
He's
starin'
at
me
in
disbelief
My
temper
is
buildin',
he's
starin'
at
me,
I
grab
my
key
He's
starin'
at
me,
I
started
the
car,
then
I
tried
to
leave
And
somethin'
told
me
to
keep
it
in
park
until
I
could
see
The
reason
why
he
was
mad
at
a
stranger
Like
I
was
supposed
to
save
him
Like
I'm
the
reason
he's
homeless
and
askin'
me
for
a
favor
He's
starin'
at
me,
his
eyes
followed
me
with
no
laser
He's
starin'
at
me,
I
notice
that
his
stare
is
contagious
'Cause
now
I'm
starin'
back
at
him,
feelin'
some
type
of
disrespect
If
I
could
throw
a
bat
at
him,
it'd
be
aimin'
at
his
neck
I
never
understood
someone
beggin'
for
goods
Askin'
for
handouts,
takin'
it
if
they
could
And
this
particular
person
just
had
it
down
pat
Starin'
at
me
for
the
longest
until
he
finally
asked
"Have
you
ever
opened
up
Exodus
14?
A
humble
man
is
all
that
we
ever
need"
Tell
me;
how
much
a
dollar
cost?
It's
more
to
feed
your
mind
Water,
sun
and
love,
the
one
you
love
All
you
need,
the
air
you
breathe
Guilt
trippin'
and
feelin'
resentment
I
never
met
a
transient
that
demanded
attention
They
got
me
frustrated,
indecisive
and
power
trippin'
Sour
emotions
got
me
lookin'
at
the
universe
different
I
should
distance
myself,
I
should
keep
it
relentless
My
selfishness
is
what
got
me
here,
who
the
fuck
I'm
kiddin'?
So
I'ma
tell
you
like
I
told
the
last
bum
Crumbs
and
pennies,
I
need
all
of
mines
And
I
recognize
this
type
of
panhandlin'
all
the
time
I
got
better
judgment,
I
know
when
nigga's
hustlin',
keep
in
mind
When
I
was
strugglin',
I
did
compromise,
now
I
comprehend
I
smell
Grandpa's
old
medicine,
reekin'
from
your
skin
Moonshine
and
gin,
nigga
you're
babblin',
your
words
ain't
flatterin'
I'm
imaginin'
Denzel
but
lookin'
at
O'Neal
Kazaam
is
sad
thrills,
your
gimmick
is
mediocre
The
jig
is
up,
I
seen
you
from
a
mile
away
losin'
focus
And
I'm
insensitive,
and
I
lack
empathy
He
looked
at
me
and
said,
"Your
potential
is
bittersweet"
I
looked
at
him
and
said,
"Every
nickel
is
mines
to
keep"
He
looked
at
me
and
said,
"Know
the
truth,
it'll
set
you
free
You're
lookin'
at
the
Messiah,
the
son
of
Jehovah,
the
higher
power
The
choir
that
spoke
the
word,
the
Holy
Spirit
The
nerve
of
Nazareth,
and
I'll
tell
you
just
how
much
a
dollar
cost
The
price
of
having
a
spot
in
Heaven,
embrace
your
loss—I
am
God"
I
washed
my
hands,
I
said
my
grace
What
more
do
you
want
from
me?
Tears
of
a
clown,
guess
I'm
not
all
what
it's
all
meant
to
be
Shades

Of

Beauty

what

I
used
to
be

mistaken
By
different

of

Then
Whit'
told
me,
"A

It

God,
then
you

I

finish
this,
witnesses
will
convey
just
what
I
mean
Been
feeling
this
way
since
I
was
16,
came
to
my
senses
You
never
liked
us
anyway,
fuck
your
friendship,
I
meant
it
I'm
African-American,
I'm
African
I'm
black
as
the
moon,
heritage
of
a
small
village
Pardon
my
residence
Came
from
the
bottom
of
mankind
My
hair
is
nappy,
my
dick
is
big,
my
nose
is
round
and
wide
You
hate
me
don't
you?
You
hate
my
people,
your
plan
is
to
terminate
my
culture
You're
fuckin'
evil
I
want
you
to
recognize
that
I'm
a
proud
monkey
You
vandalize
my
perception
but
can't
take
style
from
me
And
this
is
more
than
confession
I
mean
I
might
press
the
button
just
so
you
know
my
discretion
I'm
caught
in
my
feelings,
I
know
that
you
feel
it
You
sabotage
my
community,
makin'
a
killin'
You
made
me
a
killer,
emancipation
of
a
real
nigga
The
blacker
the
berry,
the
sweeter
the
juice
The
blacker
the
berry,
the
sweeter
the
juice
The
blacker
the
berry,
the
sweeter
the
juice
The
blacker
the
berry,
the
bigger
I
shoot
I
said
they
treat
me
like
a
slave,
cah'
me
black
Woi,
we
feel
a
whole
heap
of
pain,
cah'
we
black
And
man
a
say
they
put
me
inna
chains,
cah'
we
black
Imagine
now,
big
gold
chains
full
of
rocks
How
you
no
see
the
whip,
left
scars
'pon
me
back
But
now
we
have
a
big
whip
parked
'pon
the
block
All
them
say
we
doomed
from
the
start,
cah'
we
black
Remember
this,
every
race
start
from
the
block,
jus
'member
dat
I'm
the
biggest
hypocrite
of
2015
Once
I
finish
this,
witnesses
will
convey
just
what
I
mean
I
mean,
it's
evident
that
I'm
irrelevant
to
society
That's
what
you're
telling
me,
penitentiary
would
only
hire
me
Curse
me
till
I'm
dead
Church
me
with
your
fake
prophesizing
that
I'ma
be
just
another
slave
in
my
head
Institutionalized
manipulation
and
lies
Reciprocation
of
freedom
only
live
in
your
eyes
You
hate
me
don't
you?
I
know
you
hate
me
just
as
much
as
you
hate
yourself
Jealous
of
my
wisdom
and
cards
I
dealt
Watchin'
me
as
I
pull
up,
fill
up
my
tank,
then
peel
out
Muscle
cars
like
pull
ups,
show
you
what
these
big
wheels
'bout,
ah
Black
and
successful,
this
black
man
meant
to
be
special
Katzkins
on
my
radar,
bitch,
how
can
I
help
you?
How
can
I
tell
you
I'm
making
a
killin'?
You
made
me
a
killer,
emancipation
of
a
real
nigga
The
blacker
the
berry,
the
sweeter
the

The
blacker

The

All

Remember

I'm
the

hypocrite
of

When
I
finish
this
if
you
listenin'
then
sure
you
will
agree
This
plot
is
bigger
than
me,
it's
generational
hatred
It's
genocism,
it's
grimy,
little
justification
I'm
African-American,
I'm
African
I'm
black
as
the
heart
of
a
fuckin'
Aryan
I'm
black
as
the
name
of
Tyrone
and
Darius
Excuse
my
French
but
fuck
you
—
no,
fuck
y'all
That's
as
blunt
as
it
gets,
I
know
you
hate
me,
don't
you?
You
hate
my
people,
I
can
tell
cause
it's
threats
when
I
see
you
I
can
tell
cause
your
ways
deceitful
Know
I
can
tell
because
you're
in
love
with
that
Desert
Eagle
Thinkin'
maliciously,
he
get
a
chain
then
you
gone
bleed
him
It's
funny
how
Zulu
and
Xhosa
might
go
to
war
Two
tribal
armies
that
want
to
build
and
destroy
Remind
me
of
these
Compton
Crip
gangs
that
live
next
door
Beefin'
with
Pirus,
only
death
settle
the
score
So
don't
matter
how
much
I
say
I
like
to
preach
with
the
Panthers
Or
tell
Georgia
State
"Marcus
Garvey
got
all
the
answers"
Or
try
to
celebrate
February
like
it's
my
B-Day
Or
eat
watermelon,
chicken,
and
Kool-Aid
on
weekdays
Or
jump
high
enough
to
get
Michael
Jordan
endorsements
Or
watch
BET
cause
urban
support
is
important
So
why
did
I
weep
when
Trayvon
Martin
was
in
the
street
When
gang
banging
make
me
kill
a
nigga
blacker
than
me?
Hypocrite!
Study
long,
study
wrong,
nigga
Hey,
y'all
close
that
front
door,
y'all
let
flies
in
this
motherfucker
Close
that
door!
My
OG
up
in
this
motherfucker
right
now
My
pops
man
with
the
bottle
of
Hennessy
in
his

actin'
a
fool
Hey,
hey,

out,
I'ma
tell
you
what
my
mama
had
said,
she
like:
I
could
spot
you
a
mile
away
I
could
see
your
insecurities
written
all
on
your
face
So
predictable
your
words,
I
know
what
you
gonna
say
Who
you
foolin'?
Oh,
you
assuming
you
can
just
come
and
hang
With
the
homies
but
your
level
of
realness
ain't
the
same
Circus
acts
only
attract
those
that
entertain
Small
talk,
we
know
that
it's
all
talk
We
live
in
the
Laugh
Factory
every
time
they
mention
your
name
Askin'
"where
the
hoes

to
impress
me
Askin'
"where

moneybags?"
to

Say

You

And
the
world
don't

you
And
the
culture
don't
accept
you
But
you
think
it's
all
love
And
the
girls
gon'
neglect
you
once
your
parody
is
done
Reputation
can't
protect
you
if
you
never
had
one
Jealousy
(complex),
emotional
(complex)
Self-pity
(complex),
under
oath
(complex)
The
loudest
one
in
the
room,
nigga,
that's
a
complex
Let
me
put
it
back
in

You

(Pause)
What
do
you
got
to
offer?
Tell
me
before
we
off
ya,
put
you
deep
in
the
coffin
Been
allergic
to
talkin',
been
a
virgin
to
bullshit
And
sell
a
dream
in
the
auction,
tell
me
just
who
your
boss
is
Niggas
be
fugazi,
bitches
be
fugazi
This
is
for
fugazi
Niggas
and
bitches
who
make
habitual
lyin'
babies
Bless
them
little
hearts
You
can
never
persuade
me
You
can
never
relate
me
to
him,
to
her,
or
that
to
them
Or
you,
the
truth
you
love
to
bend
In
the
back,
in
the
bed,
on
the
floor,
that's
your
ho
On
the
couch,
in
the
mouth,
I'll
be
out,
really
though
So
loud,
rich
niggas
got
low
money
And
loud,
broke
niggas
got
no
money
The
irony
behind
it
is
so
funny
And
I
seen
it
all
this
past
year
Pass
on
some
advice
we
feel:
You
ain't
gotta
lie
to
kick

You
ain't
gotta
lie,

Trial,

but
I

God
The
Devil
wanna
put

a
bow
tie
Pray
that
the
holy
water
don't
go
dry
As
I
look
around
me
So
many
motherfuckers
wanna

But
an
enemigo
never
drown
me
In
front
of
a
dirty
double-mirror
they
found
me
And
(I
love

When
you
lookin'

(I

Ahh,

Illuminated

One
day
at
a

They
wanna
say
it's
a
war
outside,
bomb
in
the

Gun
in

Rock

And

uh
These
days
of
frustration
keep
y'all

(Come

I
duck
these
cold

fi-fie-fo-fum
basis
Dreams
of
reality's
peace
Blow
steam
in
the

Sky

now
Look

When

Baby

Lift

(Haunt

Peace

On

You

What

and

Everybody

How

How

So
I

I

With

I've

adolescent
Duckin'

never

the
message
I
could
never
take
the
lead,
I
could
never
bob
and
weave
From
a
negative
and
letting
them
annihilate
me
And
it's
evident
I'm
moving
at
a
meteor
speed
Finna
run
into
a
building,
lay

We

before

All
my
niggas
listen,
listen
to
this:
I
promised
Dave
I'd
never
use
the
phrase
"fuck
nigga"
He
said,
"Think
about
what
you
saying:
"Fuck
niggas"
No
better
than
Samuel
on
the
Django
No
better
than
a
white
man
with
slave
boats"
Sound
like
I
needed
some
soul
searching
My
Pops
gave
me
some
game
in
real
person
Retraced
my
steps
on
what
they
never
taught
me
Did
my
homework
fast
before
government
caught
me
So
I'ma
dedicate
this
one
verse
to
Oprah
On
how
the
infamous,
sensitive
N-word
control
us
So
many
artists
gave
her
an
explanation
to
hold
us
Well,
this
is
my
explanation
straight
from
Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S
definition:
royalty;
king
royalty
-
wait
listen
N-E-G-U-S
description:
black
emperor,
king,
ruler,
now
let
me
finish
The
history
books
overlook
the
word
and
hide
it
America
tried
to
make
it
to
a
house
divided
The
homies
don't
recognize
we
been
using
it
wrong
So
I'ma
break
it
down
and
put
my
game
in
a
song
N-E-G-U-S,
say
it
with
me,
or
say
it
no
more
Black
stars
can
come
and
get
me
Take
it
from
Oprah
Winfrey,
tell
her
she
right
on
time
Kendrick
Lamar,
by
far,
realest
Negus
alive
Ohhh,
ohhhh,
woahhh
Uh,
yeah
Uh,
yeah
Yeah,
uh
The
ghost
of
Mandela,
hope
my
flows
stay
propellin'
Let
these
words
be
your
Earth
and
moon,
you
consume
every
message
As
I
lead
this
army,
make
room
for
mistakes
and
depression
And
with
that
being
said,
my
nigga,
let
me
ask
this
question:
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
When
shit
hit
the
fan—
(one
two,
one
two)
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
The
ghost
of

Let
these
words
be
your
Earth
and
moon,
you
consume
every
message
As
I
lead
this
army,
make
room
for
mistakes
and
depression
And
with
that
being
said,
my
nigga,
let
me
ask
this
question:
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
Won't
you
look
to
your
left
and
right?
Make
sure
you
ask
your
friends
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
Do
you
believe
in
me?
Are
you
deceiving
me?
Could
I
let
you
down
easily,
is
your
heart
where
it
need
to
be?
Is
your
smile
on
permanent?
Is
your
vow
on
lifetime?
Would
you
know
where
the
sermon
is
if
I
died
in
this
next
line?
If
I’m
tried
in
a
court
of
law,
if
the
industry
cut
me
off
If
the
government
want
me
dead,
plant
cocaine
in
my
car
Would
you
judge
me
a
drug-head
or
see
me
as
K.
Lamar?
Or
question
my
character
and
degrade
me
on
every
blog?
Want
you
to
love
me
like
Nelson,
want
you
to
hug
me
like
Nelson
I
freed
you
from
being
a
slave
in
your
mind,
you’re
very
welcome
You
tell
me
my
song
is
more
than
a
song,
it’s
surely
a
blessing
But
a
prophet
ain’t
a
prophet
til
they
ask
you
this
question:
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
Won't
you
look
to
your
left
and
right?
Make
sure
you
ask
your
friends
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
The
ghost
of
Mandela,
hope
my
flows
stay
propellin'
Let
my
words
be
your
Earth
and
moon,
you
consume
every
message
As
I
lead
this
army,
make
room
for
mistakes
and
depression
And
with
that—
Do
you
believe
in
me?
How
much
you
believe
in
her?
You
think
she
gon’
stick
around
if
them
25
years
occur?
You
think
he
can
hold
you
down
when
you
down
behind
bars,
hurt?
You
think
y’all
on
common
ground
if
you
promise
to
be
the
first?
Can
you
be
immortalized
without
your
life
being
expired?
Even
though
you
share
the
same
blood,
is
it
worth
the
time?
Like,
who
got
your
best
interest?
Like,
how
much
are
you
dependent?
How
clutch
are
the
people
that
say
they
love
you?
And
who
pretending?
How
tough
is
your
skin
when
they
turn
you
in?
Do
you
show
forgiveness?
What
brush
do
you
bend
when
dusting
your
shoulders
from
being
offended?
What
kind
of
den
did
they
put
you
in
when
the
lions
start
hissing?
What
kind
of
bridge
did
they
burn?
Revenge
on
your
mind
when
it’s
mentioned
You
wanna
love
like
Nelson,
you
wanna
be
like
Nelson
You
wanna
walk
in
his
shoes,
but
your
peacemaking
seldom
You
wanna
be
remembered
that
delivered
the
message
That
considered
the
blessing
of
everyone
This
your
lesson
for
everyone,
say;
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
Won't
you
look
to
your
left
and
right?
Make
sure
you
ask
your
friends
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
The
voice
of
Mandela,
hope
this
flow
stay
propellin'
Let
my
word
be
your
Earth
and
moon,
you
consume
every
message
As
I
lead
this
army,
make
room
for
mistakes
and
depression
And
if
you
riding
with
me,
nigga—
I
been
wrote
off
before,
I
got
abandonment
issues
I
hold
grudges
like
bad
judges,
don’t
let
me
resent
you
That’s
not
Nelson-like—want
you
to
love
me
like
Nelson
I
went
to
Robben’s
Island
analysing;
that’s
where
his
cell
is
So
I
could
find
clarity—like,
how
much
you
cherish
me?
Is
this
relationship
a
fake,
or
real
as
the
heavens
be?
See
I
got
to
question
it
all;
family,
friends,
fans,
cats,
dogs
Trees,
plants,
grass,
how
the
wind
blow,
Murphy’s
Law
Generation
X—will
I
ever
be
your
ex?
Flaws
of
a
baby
step',
mauled
by
the
mouth
a
bit—pause
Put
me
under
stress,
crawled
under
rocks,
duckin'
y’all
It’s
respect—but
then
tomorrow,
put
my
back
against
the
wall
How
many
leaders
you
said
you
needed
then
left
‘em
for
dead?
Is
it
Moses?
Is
it
Huey
Newton
or
Detroit
Red?
Is
it
Martin
Luther?
JFK?
Shooter—you
assassin
Is
it
Jackie?
Is
it
Jesse?
Oh,
I
know
it’s
Michael
Jackson—oh
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
That
nigga
gave
us
"Billie
Jean,"
you
say
he
touched
those
kids?
When
shit
hit
the
fan,
is
you
still
a
fan?
The
ghost
of
Mandela,
hope
my
flows
stay
propelling
Let
my
word
be
your
Earth
and
moon,
you
consume
every
message
As
I
lead
this
army,
make
room
for
mistakes
and
depression
And
if
you
riding
with
me,
nigga,
let
me
ask
this
question,
nigga
"I
remember
you
was
conflicted
Misusing
your
influence
Sometimes
I
did
the
same
Abusing
my
power,
full
of
resentment
Resentment
that
turned
into
a
deep
depression
Found
myself
screaming
in
the
hotel
room
I
didn’t
wanna
self
destruct
The
evils
of
Lucy
was
all
around
me
So
I
went
running
for
answers
Until
I
came
home
But
that
didn’t
stop
survivor’s
guilt
Going
back
and
forth
trying
to
convince
myself
the
stripes
I
earned
Or
maybe
how
A-1
my
foundation
was
But
while
my
loved
ones
was
fighting
the
continuous
war
back
in
the
city
I
was
entering
a
new
one
A
war
that
was
based
on
apartheid
and
discrimination
Made
me
wanna
go
back
to
the
city
and
tell
the
homies
what
I
learned
The
word
was
respect
Just
because
you
wore
a
different
gang
color
than
mine's
Doesn’t
mean
I
can’t
respect
you
as
a
black
man
Forgetting
all
the
pain
and
hurt
we
caused
each
other
in
these
streets
If
I
respect
you,
we
unify
and
stop
the
enemy
from
killing
us
But
I
don’t
know,
I’m
no
mortal
man
Maybe
I’m
just
another
nigga”
Shit
and
that’s
all
I
wrote
I
was
gonna
call
it
"Another
Nigga"
but,
it
ain’t
really
a
poem
I
just
felt
like
it’s
something
you
probably
could
relate
to
Other
than
that,
now
that
I
finally
got
a
chance
to
holla
at
you
I
always
wanted
to
ask
you
about
a
certain
situa-
About
a
metaphor
actually,
uh,
you
spoke
on
the
ground
What
you
mean
by
that,
what
the
ground
represent?
The
ground
is
gonna
open
up
and
swallow
the
evil
Right
That’s
how
I
see
it,
my
word
is
bond
I
see—and
the
ground
is
the
symbol
for
the
poor
people
Right
The
poor
people
is
gonna
open
up
this
whole
world
And
swallow
up
the
rich
people
'Cause
the
rich
people
gonna
be
so
fat
And
they
gonna
be
so
appetizing,
you
know
what
I’m
saying
Wealthy,
appetizing
The
poor
gonna
be
so
poor,
and
hungry
Right
You
know
what
I’m
saying,
it’s
gonna
be
like
You
know
what
I'm
saying,
it's
gonna
be...
There
might,
there
might
be
some
cannibalism
out
this
muh-fu-
They
might
eat
the
rich,
you
know
what
I'm
saying?
Aight
so
let
me
ask
you
this
then
Do
you
see
yourself
as
somebody
that’s
rich
Or
somebody
that
made
the
best
of
they
own
opportunities?
I
see
myself
as
a
natural
born
hustler
A
true
hustler
in
every
sense
of
the
word
I
took
nothin’,
I
took
the
opportunities
I
worked
at
the
most
menial
and
degrading
job
And
built
myself
up
so
I
could
get
it
to
where
I
owned
it
I
went
from
having
somebody
managing
me
To
me
hiring
the
person
that
works
my
management
company
I
changed
everything,
I
realized
my
destiny
In
a
matter
of
five
years,
you
know
what
I’m
saying?
I
made
myself
a
millionaire,
I
made
millions
for
a
lot
of
people
Now
it’s
time
to
make
millions
for
myself,
you
know
what
I’m
saying?
I
made
millions
for
the
record
companies
I
made
millions
for
these
movie
companies
Now
I
make
millions
for,
for
us
And
through
your
different
avenues
of
success
How
would
you
say
you
managed
to
keep
a
level
of
sanity?
By
my
faith
in
God,
by
my
faith
in
the
game
And
by
my
faith
in
"all
good
things
come
to
those
that
stay
true"
Right
You
know
what
I’m
saying?
And
it
was
happening
to
me
for
a
reason
You
know
what
I’m
saying,
I
was
noticing,
shit
I
was
punching
the
right
buttons
and
it
was
happening
So
it’s
no
problem,
you
know
I
mean,
it’s
a
problem
but
I’m
not
finna
let
them
know
I’m
finna
go
straight
through
Would
you
consider
yourself
a
fighter
at
heart
or
somebody
that
Somebody
that
only
reacts
when
they
back
is
against
the
wall?
Shit,
I
like
to
think
that
at
every
opportunity
I’ve
ever
been,
uh
Threatened
with
resistance,
it’s
been
met
with
resistance
And
not
only
me
but,
it
goes
down
my
family
tree
You
know
what
I’m
saying,
it’s
in
my
veins
to
fight
back
Aight
well,
how
long
will
you
think
it
take
before
niggas
be
like
"We
fighting
a
war,
I’m
fighting
a
war
I
can’t
win
And
I
wanna
lay
it
all
down"
In
this
country,
a
black
man
only
have
like
5
years
we
can
exhibit
maximum
strength
And
that’s
right
now
while
you
a
teenager,
while
you
still
strong
While
you
still
wanna
lift
weights,
while
you
still
wanna
shoot
back
'Cause
once
you
turn
30
it’s
like
They
take
the
heart
and
soul
out
of
a
man
Out
of
a
black
man,
in
this
country
And
you
don’t
wanna
fight
no
more
And
if
you
don’t
believe
me,
you
can
look
around
You
don’t
see
no
loud
mouth
30-year
old
motherfuckers
That’s
crazy,
because
me
being
one
of
your
offsprings
Of
the
legacy
you
left
behind,
I
can
truly
tell
you
that
There’s
nothing
but
turmoil
goin’
on
so,
I
wanted
to
ask
you
What
you
think
is
the
future
for
me
and
my
generation
today?
I
think
that
niggas
is
tired
of
grabbin'
shit
out
the
stores
And
next
time
it's
a
riot
it's
gonna
be
like,
uh,
bloodshed
For
real,
I
don’t
think
America
know
that
I
think
America
think
we
was
just
playing
And
it’s
gonna
be
some
more
playing
but
It
ain’t
gonna
be
no
playing
It’s
gonna
be
murder,
you
know
what
I’m
saying?
It’s
gonna
be
like
Nat
Turner,
1831,
up
in
this
motherfucker
You
know
what
I’m
saying,
it’s
gonna
happen
That’s
crazy
man,
in
my
opinion
Only
hope
that
we
kinda
have
left
is
music
and
vibrations
Lot
a
people
don’t
understand
how
important
it
is,
you
know
Sometimes
I
can
like,
get
behind
a
mic
And
I
don’t
know
what
type
of
energy
I’ma
push
out
Or
where
it
comes
from,
trip
me
out
sometimes
Because
it's
spirits,
we
ain’t
even
really
rappin’
We
just
letting
our
dead
homies
tell
stories
for
us
Damn
I
wanted
to
read
one
last
thing
to
you
It’s
actually
something
a
good
friend
had
wrote
Describing
my
world,
it
says:
“The
caterpillar
is
a
prisoner
to
the
streets
that
conceived
it
Its
only
job
is
to
eat
or
consume
everything
around
it
In
order
to
protect
itself
from
this
mad
city
While
consuming
its
environment
The
caterpillar
begins
to
notice
ways
to
survive
One
thing
it
noticed
is
how
much
the
world
shuns
him
But
praises
the
butterfly
The
butterfly
represents
the
talent,
the
thoughtfulness
And
the
beauty
within
the
caterpillar
But
having
a
harsh
outlook
on
life
The
caterpillar
sees
the
butterfly
as
weak
And
figures
out
a
way
to
pimp
it
to
his
own
benefits
Already
surrounded
by
this
mad
city
The
caterpillar
goes
to
work
on
the
cocoon
Which
institutionalizes
him
He
can
no
longer
see
past
his
own
thoughts
He’s
trapped
When
trapped
inside
these
walls
certain
ideas
take
root,
such
as
Going
home,
and
bringing
back
new
concepts
to
this
mad
city
The
result?
Wings
begin
to
emerge,
breaking
the
cycle
of
feeling
stagnant
Finally
free,
the
butterfly
sheds
light
on
situations
That
the
caterpillar
never
considered,
ending
the
internal
struggle
Although
the
butterfly
and
caterpillar
are
completely
different
They
are
one
and
the
same"
What’s
your
perspective
on
that?
Pac?
Pac?
Pac?!
"Every
Nigger
Is
A
Star"
are
the
first
words
we
hear.
Then
it's
Kendrick,
fantasising
about
fame
and
fortune,
followed
by
rhymes
from
the
perspective
of
the
"pimp"
(Uncle
Sam)
on
"Wesley's
Theory".
Themes
of
fame
and
exploitation
continue
in
"For
Free
(Interlude)",
where
a
woman
(possibly
Lucy)
highlights
the
dissimilarity
between
Kendrick
and
a
"baller
ass,
boss
ass
nigga."
The
two
opening
cuts
describe
Kendrick
as
the
caterpillar
whose
only
thoughts
are
consumption.
He
continues
on
"King
Kunta"
-
an
unapologetic
track
that
captures
his
vanity.
Kendrick
questions
the
loyalty
of
his
friends,
claiming
to
have
risen
from
"a
peasant
to
a
prince
to
a
motherfuckin'
king"
-
when
in
reality
he's
getting
"pimped,"
ready
to
become
the
next
Wesley
Snipes.
Abusing
my
power
full
of
resentment
Resentment
that
turned
into
a
deep
depression
Found
myself
screaming
in
a
hotel
roomHe
screams
"loving
you
is
complicated"
-
slipping
into
a
deep,
self
loathing
depression
on
"u"
Kendrick
comes
to
realise
Lucy
and
Uncle
Sam
have
trapped
him
in
fame,
and
goes
so
far
to
suggest
suicide,
guilt
stricken
over
his
teenage
sister
becoming
pregnant
and
the
death
of
his
friend
Chad
Keaton.
He
tries
to
find
God
on
"Alright",
yet
still
struggles,
promising
to
either
beat
his
depression
or
commit
suicide:
"I
keep
my
head
up
high
/
I
cross
my
heart
and
hope
to
die."
I
didn't
wanna
self
destruct
The
evils
of
Lucy
was
all
around
me
So
I
went
runnin'
for
answersImmediately
after
seeking
out
God
on
"Alright",
Lucy
(Lucifer)
comes
to
the
forefront
on
"For
Sale
(Interlude)."
Juxtaposing
the
earlier
"For
Free
(Interlude),"
Kendrick
wrestles
with
Lucy
as
she
tries
to
"pimp"
him
into
guaranteed
fame
and
success:
"Lucy
gone
fill
your
pockets
/
Lucy
gone
move
your
mama
out
of
Compton
/
Inside
the
gi-gantic
mansion
like
I
promised".
Until
I
came
homeAs
he
begins
to
remember
who
he
was
before
the
fame,
Kendrick
returns
to
Compton
during
"Momma"
and
"Hood
Politics."
In
the
third
verse
of
"Momma"
he
goes
home
to
Africa
where
he
meets
a
boy
who
gives
him
an
ultimatum,
which
he
agrees
to:
"I
can
be
your
advocate
/
I
can
preach
for
you
if
you
tell
me
what
the
matter
is."
After
taking
his
vow,
Kendrick
soon
realises
on
"Hood
Politics"
that
the
caterpillars
continue
to
consume
everything,
and
the
plight
of
the
caterpillar
has
a
cause-effect
relationship
the
ghettos
(cocoons)
internal
struggle:
"From
Compton
to
Congress
/
Set
trippin’
all
around
/
Ain’t
nothin'
new
but
a
flow
of
new
DemoCrips
and
ReBloodlicans
/
Red
state
versus
a
blue
state,
which
one
you
governin’?"
But
that
didn't
stop
survivor's
guilt
Going
back
and
forth
Trying
to
convince
my
self
the
stripes
I
earned
Or
maybe
how
A-1
my
foundation
was
But
while
my
loved
ones
was
fighting
A
continuous
war
back
in
the
city
I
was
entering
a
new
oneMoney,
race,
and
violence
are
represented
by
the
subsequent
three
tracks:
"How
Much
a
Dollar
Cost,"
"Complexion
(Zulu
Love)"
&
"The
Blacker
The
Berry."
It's
here
Kendrick
completes
the
evolution
from
caterpillar
to
butterfly
and
is
free
of
Lucy
&
Uncle
Sam.
He
attempts
to
unite
his
brothers
and
sisters
against
racism
during
"Complexion
(Zulu
Love)",
however
becomes
angry
and
frustrated
by
the
hypocrisy
of
the
ghetto
in
"The
Blacker
The
Berry":
"So
why
did
I
weep
when
Trayvon
Martin
was
in
the
street?
/
When
gang
banging
make
me
kill
a
nigga
blacker
than
me?
/
Hypocrite!"
The
caterpillar
consumed,
the
cocoon
institutionalised,
and
the
butterfly
flourished.
Kendrick
reflects
on
his
journey
and
looks
towards
the
future
throughout
"Mortal
Man."
Like
Mandela,
Malcolm
X
&
Martin
Luther
King
-
Kendrick
Lamar
Duckworth
requests
unwavering
loyalty
from
his
fans:
"generation
X,
will
I
ever
be
your
X?"
He
wants
everyone
to
join
him.
To
Pimp
A
Butterfly
is
a
vicarious
journey
through
K
Lamar.
While
the
caterpillar
and
the
butterfly
are
one
in
the
same;
the
struggle,
triumph
and
emotion
are
all
experienced
to
ask
one
question:
what's
your
perspective
on
that?
A
war
that
was
based
on
apartheid
and
discrimination
Made
me
wanna
go
back
to
the
city
and
tell
the
homies
what
I
learned
The
word
was
respect
Just
because
you
wore
a
different
gang
colour
than
mine's
Doesn’t
mean
I
can’t
respect
you
as
a
black
man
Forgetting
all
the
pain
and
hurt
we
caused
each
other
in
these
streets
If
I
respect
you,
we
unify
and
stop
the
enemy
from
killing
us
But
I
don’t
know,
I’m
no
mortal
man,
maybe
I’m
just
another
niggaWhat
were
your
takeaways
from
Kendrick
Lamar's
To
Pimp
A
Butterfly?
Let
us
know
in
the
comments.
This
is

more
than
suicide
(I
love
my...
self)
One
day
at
a
time,
sun
gonna
shine
(Hold
up)
I
went
to
war
last
night
With
an
automatic
weapon,
don't
nobody
call
a
medic
I'ma
do
it
till
I
get
it
right
I
went
to
war
last
night
I've
been
dealing
with
depression
ever
since
an
adolescent
Duckin'
every
other
blessin',
I
can
never
see
the
message
I
could
never
take
the
lead,
I
could
never
bob
and
weave
From
a
negative
and
letting
them
annihilate
me
And
it's
evident
I'm
moving
at
a
meteor
speed
Finna
run
into
a
building,
lay
my
body
in
the
street
Keep
my
money
in
the
ceiling,
let
my
mama
know
I'm
free
Give
my
story
to
the
children
and
a
lesson
they
can
read
And
the
glory
to
the
feeling
of
the
holy
unseen
Seen
enough,
make
a
motherfucker
scream,
"I
love
myself!"
I
lost
my
head
I
must've
misread
what
the
good
book
said
Oh,
woes
keep
me,
it's
a
jungle
inside
Give
myself
again
'til
the
well
runs
dry
(i)
"I’ll
tell
you
what
I
don’t
believe
in,
can
I
do
that?
All
right,
I
don’t
believe
in
laws,
or
the
system
by
any
means,
whatsoever.
I
try
not
to
obey
them
at
anytime.
That's
what
I
believe
in
not
believing
in."
"So
what
keeps
you
alive?"
"Four
big
bottles
of
water
a
day,
two
packs
of
Marlboro
Reds.
And,
uh,
I
don’t
-
what
keeps
me
alive,
shit.
Music,
I
have
to
listen
to
music
all
day
long.
I'd
say
that
keeps
me
going.
I’m
a
pretty
dark
person,
I’ve
thought
about
ending
it
a
million
times.
And
I
have
to
say
that
music
keeps
me
here,
by
far,
the
main
thing."
Thank
you
Sitting
in
the
studio
thinking
about
which
mood
would
go
Right
now,
freestyle
or
write
down,
whatever
It
still'll
come
up
clever,
I
just
need
to
free
my
thoughts
And
Lord
knows
that
I
know
better,
but
I
ain't
perfect
I
ain't
seen
too
many
churches
or
know
them
testament
verses
You
should
either
hear
me
now
or
go
deaf
Or
end
up
dead,
die
trying
and
know
death
Might
end
up
dead,
swallow
blood,
swallow
my
breath
Fuck
a
funeral,
just
make
sure
you
pay
my
music
respect,
nigga
I
mean
that
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
You
see
my
art
is
all
I
have
And
victory
tastes
sweet,
even
when
the
enemy
can
throw
salt
Still
knock
them
out
the
park
like
a
fucking
tow
car
Let
bygones
be
bygones,
but
where
I'm
from
We
buy
guns
and
more
guns
to
give
to
the
young
I'm
living
the
life
of
a
nigga
trapped,
nigga
Inside
the
system
all
you
envision
is
trap
niggas
My
uncle
doing
life
inside
prison;
he
wasn't
wrapped
too
tight
He
told
me
"Rap
about
life,
not
rap
niggas"
That's
why
I'm
shaking
my
head
when
you
rap-dissin'
My
stomach
start
turning,
my
nerves
get
to
twitching
I
start
evaluating,
then
my
final
intuition
Is
that
you
wishing
a
come
up,
would
just
come
up
We
used
to
beefing
over
turf,
fuck
beefing
over
a
verse
Niggas
dying,
motherfuck
a
double
entendre
And
this
is
Comp-ton,
lions
in
the
land
of
the
triumph
Wrap-Saran
our
defiance,
ban
our
alliance
Put
burners
in
the
hands
of
the
black
man
One
hood
with
20
four-fours
like
a
cloned
Kobe
Bryant
You
probably
heard
I
wanna
be
heard
and
wonder
who
I
am
You
probably
even
listened
to
"Faith,"
and
think
I
know
Zion
But
really
I'm
just
caught
in
the
loop,
of
understanding
the
truth
Because
it
seem
like
it's
always
clashing
with
science
I
got
a
big
fear
of
flying
My
future
so
bright
I'd
probably
go
blind
before
I
blink
twice
I
ain't
lying
I
swear
to
God,
half
of
y'all
just
don't
know
Kendrick
The
school
of
hard
knocks,
we
was
the
first
ones
in
attendance
You
walking
down
the
block,
he
got
shot,
you
are
no
eye
witness
You
just
mind
your
business
You
just
turn
your
head,
kneel
down
and
then
tie
your
tennis
It's
kind
of
scary,
ain't
it?
You
can't
act
like
no
bitch,
that
only
got
Tyler
Perry
famous
Just
let
me
explain
this,
why
you
pick
up
that
stainless
'Cause
your
pops
wasn't
anxious
to
see
you
and
you
hate
it
So
much
you
probably
had
your
burner
tucked
at
graduation
So
if
you
see
him
on
'em
bleachers
then
you
kill
him
Facing
25
to
life
with
a
murder
charge
Your
enemies
was
the
prey
and
now
you
pray
to
God
I
pray
these
bars
get
farther
than
Compton
And
if
our
record
never
break,
I
still
won’t
break
my
promise
I
promise
to
keep
it
honest
Secret
society,
all
we
ask
is
trust
And
all
we
lack
is
communication
like
service
sucks
The
people
scared
of
annihilation
when
Kingdom
Come
And
I'm
like,
"The
Kendrick
Lamar
OD
in
less
than
a
month,
all
right?"
Gotta
keep
it
pushing
Can't
let
the
government
tell
me
how
my
future
looking
I'm
on
Rosecrans
and
Central
trying
to
duck
the
central
bookins'
If
the
fucking
pigs
get
behind
me
then
you
know
I'm
bookin'
Never
will
I
surrender
I
been
a
warrior
when
I
came
out
my
mom's
placenta
In
the
gutter
lane
like
I'm
Master
Splinter
How
splendid,
I
guess
my
project
had
did
it
Got
all
these
niggas
approaching
they
mixtapes
different
They
said
seven
tracks,
I
said
15
Called
it
an
EP,
they
said
I’m
trippin'
But
little
did
they
know,
I’m
tryna'
change
the
rules
That
we’ve
been
confined
to,
so
the
corporate
won’t
make
decisions
Uppity
bitches
handling
business
Killing
our
dreams,
stealing
our
vision
Out
in
Haiti,
adolescents
barely
have
a
home
In
LA
everybody
think
they
fucking
on
Hop
on
Twitter,
perpetrate
we
doing
big
shit
Who
we
hanging
with
and
bragging
about
the
iPhone
I
swear
to
God
most
of
y'all
cats
just
don’t
know
Kendrick
You
barely
know
yourself,
so
I
guess
most
of
y'all
should
be
offended
Ain’t
doing
this
for
my
health,
I’m
tryna'
purchase
my
momma
dem'
Benzes
Occupying
my
time
with
riches,
justifying
my
time
ambitions
Just
to
coincide,
just
to
go
inside,
plus
we
idolize
why
we
living
Look,
the
mastermind
took
the
master's
mind
Just
the
perfect
time,
just
to
master
mine
Just
to
match
the
grind
with
precision
Look,
the
mastermind
took
-
(cough)
We
would
like
to
call
this
an
appreciation
tape
for
those
who
recognized
the
Kendrick
Lamar
EP.
For
this
is
the
Kendrick
Lamar
OD.
Because
of
you
we
are
Overly
Dedicated
Where
are
we
going,
why
are
we
slowing
down
Where
are
you
going,
we
should
be
growing
now
(Smoke
to
it
nigga,
smoke
to
it
nigga)
Where
are
we
going,
we
should
be
slowing
down
Where
are
you
going,
we
should
be
growing
now
That’s
what
she
said
to
me,
that
place
I
used
to
call
home
Is
just
a
bed
to
me
We
don’t
even
sleep,
neighbors
can
hear
her
weep
Meanwhile
I’m
in
these
streets
with
everybody,
I’m
trying
to
get
it
And
she
know
they
got
me,
I
watch
her
feelings
watch
me
As
they
staring
with
the
saddest
eyes
of
loneliness
Look
each
other
in
the
face
and
barely
blink
I
tried
to
make
it
right
but
the
pen
ran
out
of
ink
So
if
my
letters
don’t
reach
you,
I
hope
these
lyrics
in
sync
Where
are
we
going,
why
are
we
slowing
down
Where
are
you
going,
we
should
be
growing
now
That’s
what
it
said
to
me,
but
the
place
I
call
ambition
Now
dead
to
me,
gone
and
forgotten,
I’m
off
track
Like
Dale
Earnhardt,
my
liver
rotten,
alcoholic
tripping
Fucking
bad
bitches
and
they
got
bad
intentions
Club
night,
guys
and
dolls
Balling
out
but
I'm
'bout
to
drop
the
ball
I’m
calling
out
for
help,
my
engineer
called
Told
me
come
to
the
studio
but
I
wanna
tell
him,
nah
Where
are
we
going,
why
are
we
slowing
down
Where
are
you
going,
we
should
be
growing
now
That’s
what
he
said
to
me
But
that
place
we
call
Heaven's
unfair
to
me,
only
144
can
go
Seven
billion
people
on
planet
Earth
today
Is
there
something
that
I
don’t
know
I
know
to
follow
Him
rather
following
people
Or
follow
vanity
cause
that
means
I’m
following
evil
Guess
I’m
following
evil,
I
should
follow
cathedral
Blessings
I
need
but
live
like
I
don’t
need
you
Where
are
we
going,
why
are
we
slowing
down
Where
are
you
going,
we
should
be
growing
now
So
in
conclusion
We
all
seem
to
stumble,
planning
our
own
demise
Forgetting
the
big
picture
and
making
it
wallet
size
So
to
what
is
important
in
my
life,
I
apologize
I
promise
to
stay
faithful,
focused
and
sanctified
We
all
get
distracted,
the
question
is
Would
you
bounce
back
or
bounce
backwards?
Would
you
not
know
how
to
act
or
take
action?
It’s
just
a
part
of
life
and
if
your
vision’s
impaired,
you
probably
lose
it
all
tonight
Tryna
visualize
how
to
get
it
right
but
my
vision’s
so
blurry
Tryna
slow
it
down,
stay
close
to
the
ground,
but
we’re
always
in
a
hurry
now
And
if
I
could
make
this
world
spin
a
little
slower,
then
I
would
Then
we
could
grow
a
little
closer,
I
think
we’re
getting
closer
I
think
we’re
getting
closer
I
remember,
uhh
When
my
uncles
Served
smokers
On
Alondra
In

A

Uhh,
and
it's
scary
to
carry
A
smooth
type
flow
like
a
drink
of
Merlot
That'll
freak
y'all
out
like
a

Virgo
When
I
turbo
on
any
track,
it's
a
Reynold's
wrap
And
I
rap
like
a
nigga
who
invented
rap
Rapping
heat,
you

fall
to
defeat
If
you
don't
pay
ya
tolls
like
the
limbs
on
ya
feet
I

This

probably
everybody,
Illuminati
Guess
I'm
the
blood
sacrifice

a
Harley
Lights

flash,
cars

crash
Smoke
more
junk
while
the
junkies
laugh
So

bad

rehab
You

Welcome

my
diary,
stressing
got
me
gray
hairs
Something
to
inspire
me,
rather

society's
Woes,

let
me
shine
a
lil'
bit
love
I

Ronnie
on
Player's
Club
I
used
to
have
a
9
to
5,
fresh
out
of
school
that
was
'05
That
bitch
was
racist,
got
me
fired,
ever
since
then,
I
had
no
job
Pushing
in
my
momma
van,
stop
for

on
Rosecrans
Trust
me
these
niggas
rushed

Guilty

You

Pain

my
grandma's
death,
Uncle
killed
at
Louie's
Burgers
Hold
my
tears
I
tried
my
best,
let
it
go,
drenched
my
pullover
Cycles
of
a
starving
artist
tryna
go
beyond
the
margin,
margin
Maintaining
my
modest
modus
as
I
dream
So
while
I
go
through
all
this,
all
this
bullshit
what
you
call
it
Life
itself,
I
know
what
helps,
let
me
scroll
through
my
Blackberry
("Hey
what's
up

I'm

How

your

Are
you
tipsy?"
"Mhm!"
All
I

Patrón
Give

you
give

Bitch
I'm

Big

I'mma
lay
it
down
like
a
carpenter
when
you
let
me...
Give
me
that
funk,
that
sweet,
that
nasty,
that
gushy
stuff
I
can't
get
enough,

Uh,
I
wrote
this
song
when
Dave
drove
home
And
caught
that
flat,
in
the
mean
T
Flats
And
it
made
me
think
if
we
could
blink
To
change
locations
where
we
at
We
often
get
lost
in
the
alcohol
bottle
In
attempt
to
ignore
pain,
problem,
and
sorrow
Just
for
a
minute,
then
back
to
the
bullshit
Your
car
note
due
and
you
'bout
to
get
evicted
Two
drugs
surely,
Patrón,
pussy,
make
it
feel
alright
But
once
it's
empty
and
the
bitch
leave,
then
it's
back
to
life
You
can't
run
from
it,
gotta
run
to
it,
nigga
The
antidote
wouldn't
last
and
you
knew
it,
nigga
But
still,
you
proceed
to
dive
deep,
ask
what's
her
zodiac
sign
I'm
going
through
something

life
But

Finna

Crackers
watch
my

I

One

And
here
I

What

Nothing's

Pop

bust

Bust

(Soul!)
Balls

Let's

And

What's

I

Take

Living

So

I'm

so
get
inspired
And
so
he
said
"Why
you
gotta
be
so
kind-hearted?
Why
you
couldn't
be
a
con
artist?
Why
you
couldn't?
Why
you
couldn't
be
mischievous
or
just
a
lil'
devious
The
moment
that
we
first
started?
Why
you
never
ask
for
nothing,
just
a
lil'
time?
Why
you
let
me
use
yours
cus
I
don't
got
mine?
Why
you
always
lift
me
up,
when
I'm
completely
giving
up
Or
when
niggas
holla,
"What's
up?"
you
give
a
dry
response?
Why
you
giving
me
your
last
knowing
you
ain't
got
it?
Why
you
always
buy
me
something
when
you
going
shopping?
Why
you
tell
me
that
you
love
me,
Why
you
always
thinking
of
me
Want
my
company
rather
than
going
club
hopping?
Why
you
treating
my
momma
like
she
your
momma
too?
Why
you
making
promises
that
you'll
forever
do?
Whatever
just
to
make
me
happy,
wanting
us
to
have
a
family
These
are
exactly
the
reasons
why
I
cheat
on
you"
(Sometimes)
We
hurt
people
that
love
us,
love
people
that
hurt
us
We
hurt
people
that
love
us,
love
people
that
hurt

We
hurt
people
that

love
people
that
hurt

We
hurt
people
that
love
us,
love
people
that
hurt
us
Sometimes
I,
sometimes
I
feel
we
share
Nothing
in
common,
it
ain't
fair
But
where
do
we
seem
to
fall
Where
do
we
seem
to
fall
Tender
love
and
care,
once
upon
a
time
Once
upon
a
time,
we
was
there
And
so
she
said
"Why
you
gotta
be
so
mean
to
me?
Why
you
don't
know
what
you
mean
to
me?
Why
you
always
playing
games?
Why
I
feel
like
you
ashamed
Out
in
public
curse
me
out
and
make
a
scenery?
Why
you
got
other
bitches
rolling
their
eyes
at
me?
Why
text
messages
popping
up
saying,
"Hi,
Daddy"?
Why
you
treat
me
like
I'm
nothing?
Why
you
always
at
a
function?
I
be
wanting
to
go
out
but
you
don’t
ever
ask
me
Why
you
slip
and
say
her
name
when
we
having
sex?
Why
you
always
assuming
that
I
still
like
my
ex?
Every
time
we
get
into
it,
I'm
the
one
that's
feeling
stupid
You
don't
need
me,
you
gon'
leave
me,
that's
ya
favorite
threat
Why
you
never
know
how
it
feel
to
be
lonely?
Why
I
feel
I'm
the
last
option
after
ya
homies?
Why
you
always
gotta
know
that
I
will
never
let
you
go
Even
tho
you
get
violent
and
put
your
hands
on
me?"
(Sometimes)
We
hurt
people
that
love
us,
love
people
that
hurt

We
hurt
people

us
We
hurt
people
that
love
us,
love
people
that
hurt
us
Sometimes
I,
sometimes
I
feel
we
share
Nothing
in
common,
it
ain't
fair
But
where
do
we
seem
to
fall
Where
do
we
seem
to
fall
Tender
love
and
care,
once
upon
a
time
Once
upon
a
time,
we
was
there
She
says
she
loves
me
She
says
she
loves
me
So
she
clings
to
me,
even
when
I
want
to
be
left
alone
But
she's
beautiful
Like,
sometimes,
when
I
have
things
on
my
mind,
she's
the
perfect
person
to
listen
And
she
only
gives
advice,
she
says,
when
I
give
her
a
cue
She
says
she
loves
me
Like
when
I
wake
up
in
the
morning,
she's
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
with
a
plate
of
food,
wanting
to
feed
me
She
says
she
needs
me
She
says
she
loves
me
Or
like
when
I'm
stepping
out
of
the
shower,
she's
standing
there
with
the
towel,
wanting
to,
wanting
to
dry
me
off
She
says,
she
says
she
loves
me
So
instead
of
admitting
that
she
has
made
another
mistake
She
says
she
loves
me...
and
I
don't
know
about
love
I
used
to
wanna
be
like
Michael
Jordan
Figure
I
would
hit
the
NBA
and
make
me
a
fortune
Uh,
every
time
I’m
in
my
city,
I
be
acting
like
my
shit
don’t
stink
Used
to
clean
my
Rolie
chain
with
alcohol
in
the

Riding

Told

Your

Hurt

Coroners

"Momma,

dead,"
the
next
morning
I
toasted
up
with
my
homies,
we
drink
and
smoke
marijuana
Want
us
to
change
our
ways?
Uh-huh
You
see
this
game
we
play
come
from
Uncles
that
raised
me
in
Compton
Ask
me
what
I
have
accomplished
I
don't
know,
I
don't
have
conscience
I
just
load
up
and
start
dumping
On
enemies;
I'm
head
huntin',
no
sympathy,
ain't
no
love
When
you
in
these
streets,
just
get
something
Protect
your
neck
'cause
they
coming
For
sets,
respect,
split
your
onion
Then
chop
your
deck
Your
head
tumbling
like
gymnastics
(Ooh...)
'Cause
ignorance
is
bliss
Now
everybody
put
your
hands
up
high
If
you
don't
give
a
fuck,
put
your
hands
up
high
This
the
hardest
shit
you've
heard
from
LA
this
far
And
I'm
this
far
from
a
discharge,
but
never
will
I
diss
y'all
We
all
tryna
ball,
and
when
I
got
the
rock,
I'll
dish
off
Until
the
day
I
pistol-whip
you
posers
'til
y'all
pissed
off
Then
peel
off
in
a
hooptie
Come
back
and
make
these
niggas
wanna
shoot
me
And
they
bitches
wanna
salute
me
or
seduce
me
Indubitably,
I'm
too
street—indubitably,
I'ma
do
me
Better
than
your
bitch
would,
'cause
you
niggas
too
weak
But
just
give
me
two
weeks
and
I'm
good
I'll
make
an
album
that'll
put
a
smile
on
Malcolm
Make
Martin
Luther
tell
God
I'm
the
future
for
Heaven's
talent
No
tarot
card
reading;
I'm
foreseeing
you
niggas
vanish
Not
only
from
the
rap
game,
I'm
including
the
planet
Cats
so
watered-down
clowns
can
sink
Titanic
Tie
titanium
around
their
neck
and
watch
'em
panic
Give
me
respect,
dammit,
or
get
damaged
Die
young,
corpse
identified
by
your
parents
Apparently,
you're
a
parrot,
mocking
me
and
my
blueprint
But
I
won't
share
it
just
make
you
cop
it,
then
call
you
a
sheriff
Stop
it,
I'm
hearin'
the
comments
The
critics
are
calling
me
conscious
But
truthfully,
every
shooter
be
callin'
me
Compton
So
truthfully,
only
calling
me
Kweli
and
Common?
Proves...
that
ignorance
is
bliss
Now
everybody
put
your
hands
up
high
If
you
don't
give
a
fuck,
put
your
hands
up
high
And
this
still
the
hardest
shit
you've
heard
from
LA
this
far
And
I'm
this
far,
from
a
discharge,
but
never
will
I
diss
y'all
This
my
world,
I
grab
the
universe
then
play
kickball
And
they
wonder
why
these
California
earthquakes
hittin'
so
hard
I'm
So-Cal,
you
so-called
rappers
need
to
go
call
Ghostbusters
'cause
you
busters
are
Casper
when
I
go
off
I
show
up,
to
show
out
and
show
off
You
a
hundred
percent
behind
me
And
if
you
are,
then
wreck
your
car
And
walk
up
to
my
crime
scene
I
remember
bein'
17,
wishin'
someone
would
sign
me
Now
the
only
way
these
labels
get
me
back
Is
when
they
rewind
me
Backin'
down
bargains,
backin'
down
bitches
We
gon'
flip
her
Once
she
off
that
blue
dolphin,
you
gon'
tip
her
'Cause
ignorance
is
bliss
And
Willie
B,
I'm
a
fool
on
your
beats
I
bleed
out
the
speaker
As
the
speaker
that
spoke
when
they
didn't
speak
This
is
me
thinking
at
4:43
AM,
June
6th
Sometimes
I
wanna
say
fuck
rapping,
I
need
money
now
Like
should
I
start
trapping?
If
what
I
write
down
don't
collect
this
very
moment
Then
I'm
on
it,
no
question
In
the
streets,
my
niggas
is
well
connected,
let's
see
Do
I
cop
a
pound
of
kush,
promethazine
or
push
some
E?
Oxycontin
have
me
laying
on
soft
cotton
when
I
sleep?
This
is
deep
as
the
abyss,
I'm
not
just
rhyming
on
the
beat
I
be
in
spots,
chopping
the
rocks
like
Flintstone
feet
This
is
me,
frustrated,
battling
my
own
evils

should
I
sell
my

to
buy
your
zip
And
hope
one
day
it
flourish
to
a

Track

of
a

Rather
records
on

Clocking

My
nigga,
what
you
doing
on
these
corners
whipping?
"I
thought
you
had
a
show?"
Well,
my
nigga,
I
guess
I
didn't
I'm
tryna
get
this
dough,
and
easy
money
sounds
tempting
Especially
when
your
homies
pushing
V8
engines
Twenty-two
on
twenty-sixes,
Range
Rovers
rolling
up
Three-fifty
for
an
ounce
of
fire,
I
hope
I
got
enough
This
industry
calling
my
bluff,
I
need
a
new
solution
Curb-serving,
or
I
might
be
in
your
store
boosting
Two-elevens
with
Mac-11s
like
fuck
Hip
Hop
Don't
wanna

Pun,
don't
wanna
be
B.I.G.,
don't
wanna
be
Pac
Just
give
me
your
funds,
A.K.A.
everything
that
you
got
Or
everything
getting
shot,
for
nothing
Leave
you
in
shock,
coughing
up
blood
and
mumbling
Watch,
the
plans
of
a
young
man
sponsor
Moving
grams
like
relocating
your
mom's
momma
Then
expand
to
the
Hoover
dam,
water,
sherm
Contraband,
they
yearn
for
the
butt-naked
Fuck
a
verse,
verses
get
let
off
in
thirty
minutes,
six
seconds
I
disperse
to
the
world
of
unruly,
where
I
put
the
mic
down
And
pick
up
a
sack
and
a
toolie,
if
you
knew
me
You'll
know
I
always
had
a
passion
for
riddling,
writing
But
lately,
I've
been
thinking
'bout
taking
chances
to
brighten
My
future
financially,
so
please
don't
be
mad
at
me
I
gotta
do
what
I
gotta
do,
no
shit
So
I
tell
my
nigga,
"Front
me,
let
me
put
it
on
the
strip"
Then
give
it
back
when
I
think
about
the
consequence
Shit...
There
are
times,
when
you
need
someone
I
will
be
by
your
side
Oh
darling,
cause
there
is
a
light
that
shines
Special
for
you,
and
me
yeah
I-take-I-take-take
my
chances-chances-chances
Before
they
pass,
they
pass,
they
pass
Pass
me
by,
oh
darling
You've
got
to
look
at
the
other
side

Have
you
ever
felt

like
you
never
get
life?
Like
you
never
did
right,
sort
of
like
a
black
sheep?
Back
down,
backing
out
your

like
some
bad
sleep
Chasing
for
the

but
you
never
win
the

meet
Oh,
what
a
cold
world
for
a
broke
nigga,
it's
bitter
And
life's
a
bitch,
don't
hit
women,
so
I
bit
her
I
struck
enough
pain
let
her
know
I
wasn't
playing
I
was
so
sincere
like
Nas
first
name,
in
Belly
They
tell
me,
it's
very
difficult
to
see
25
And
if
I
survive
it's
probably
with
a
celly
My
opportunities
are
low
because
my
brown
complexion
floats
In
the
ghetto
rather
in
some
heels
like
Giuseppe's
They
want
me
unemployed,
until
I
hit
the
streets
Fulfilling
voids
of
broke
D-Boys
selling
weed
Fucking
up
my

'til
I

BB

that's

They

And
if

I
can't

I'ma

Barbed

In

She

At

See

She'll

The

Hoodrat

And

Have

ever
felt

you
finally
got
life
You
finally
got
right?
No
longer
a
black
sheep
Living
off
ya
dreams
like
Christina
uh-Milian
In
the
front
seat
of
a
convertible
eloping
to
get
married
What
a
feeling
of
overcoming
the
odds
It's
like
we
just
hit
the
lottery,
my
God
There
must
be
a
God,
cause
golly
You
done
made
it
through
the
fight
while
squabbling
Ali
Now
ya
lifestyle's
looking
up
and
you
escaped
the
crooked
cuffs
And
you
ain't
have
to
kill
a
nigga
just
to
make
a
couple
bucks
And
she
ain't
have
to
go
and
fuck
on
everybody
for
a
dollar
Making
good
decisions,
got
a
independent
business-mind
And
both
of
y’all
are
steady
grindin',
doing
it
the
legal
way
Just
tryna
make
a
decent
pay
on
every
second
of
the
day
But
they
won't
give
you
the
credit,
disses
out
they
mouth
You
must
have
joined
the
Illuminati
just
to
ball
out
In
the
club
like
fuck
it,
though
They
say
it's
only
one
life,
life,
life
And
if
you
say
they
can't
live
comfortable
They
gone
tell
you
that's
a
lie,
lie,
lie
So
even
if
you
overcame
doubt
and
ya
living
ain't
bad
Know
it's
a
barbed
wire
that's
always
in
your
path
Through
the
barbed
wire
(just
laugh)
Then
everybody
say...
'Cause
I
won't
get
caught
again
And
I'm
here
to
stop
the
trends
You
can
catch
me
if
you
try
Disappear
into
the
night
And
I'm
gone
So
you
made
it
past
all
the
barbed
wires?
There's
one
more
left
*Gunshot*
The
hardest
thing
for
me
to
do
Is
to
get
you,
to
know
me,
within
sixteen
bars
That's
the
hardest
thing
Who
is
K.
Dot?
A
young
nigga
from
Compton
On
the
curb
writing
raps
next
to
a
gunshot
On
the
corners
where
the
gangsters
and
the
killers
dwell
The
fraudulent
tender
scars
that
get
unveiled
Everyone
I
knew
was
either
Crip
or
Piru
Cousins
in
elementary,
relatives
in
high
school
With
that
being
said,
each
one
of
their
rivals
Was
aiming
something
at
my
head,
I
needed
survival
Got
jumped,
got
jacked,
shot
at,
shot
back
And
I
don't
even
push
a
line,
I'm
just
tryna
push
these
rhymes
In
the
midst
of
staying
neutral
and
discrete
My
momma
said
you're
judged
by
the
company
you
keep
But
what
you
can
consider,
that
if
it
goes
down
They'll
kill
you
if
you
kill
me,
it
gets
deep
nigga
So
if
you
ask
what
I'm
doing
I'm
tryna
duck
the
influence
of
my
city
that's
brewing,
real
talk,
and
This
is
why
they
fuck
with
me
(real
talk
nigga,
believe
it)
This
is
why
they
fuck
with
me
(do
what
I
do,
ya
know?)
I'm
no
gangster,
no
killer,
I'm
just
your
average
Joe
(know
that)
But
one
thing
you
should
consider,
I'm
the
realest
you
know
I
was
walking
from
Centennial
When
an
unidentified
vehicle
rolled
up,
and
I
was
like
"hol'
up"
"Where
you
from?"
I
don't
bang
"Where
you
stay?"
Westside,
that's
a
Piru
gang
to
be
exact
Well
aware
they
had
blue
across
they
hat
Dropped
backpack
and
ran
inside
of
the
cul-de-sac
Shots
rang
out,
hoping
to
God
I
wasn't
wet
Crossed
across
Rosecrans
and
ran
inside
of
the
yet
Chirped
the
homies
on
the
I-95,
they
said
they
already
knew
What
happened,
and
meet
'em
outside
the
garage
Never
seen
that
many
guns
in
my
life
I
was
paranoid
like
a
fiend
in
the
night,
but
needed
revenge
Grabbed
the
nine-ball,
opened
up
the
door,
then
got
in
Somebody
said,
"fall
back,
we
gon'
make
these
niggas
suffer
You
my
brother
like
a
frat,
and
that's
just
to
remind
you"
Thought
about
that
so
long
I
had
failed
my
finals,
fuck,
but
This
is
why
they
fuck
with
me
(I
told
you,
nigga)
This
is
why
they
fuck
with
me
(you
fake
nigga)
I'm
no
gangster,
no
killer,
I'm
just
your
average
Joe
(you
fake)
But
one
thing
you
should
consider,
I'm
the
realest
you
know
I
don't
do
black
music,
I
don't
do
white
music
I
do
everyday
life
music
Give
'em
cuts
like
a
nigga
pierced
a
knife
through
it
You
say
you
through,
but
I've
been
through
it,
now
that's
cold
And
this
is
for
my
county
building
children
In
Hub
City
on
hubcaps,
no
power-steering
I
use
perseverance
in
this
mad
city
Where
the
niggas
drink
Remy
and
hold
semis
for
cutthroats
Bernie
Mac
died,
it's
no
joke
Don't
ask
why
if
you
don't
know
about
these
killers
and
thieves
Seven
grams
of
weed,
you
smoke
that,
but
I'm
high
off
life
I
could
fall
out
the
sky
like
twice
And
land
in
the
land
of
the
AKs
And
the
minivans
where
the
fan
never
on
Cause
it's
hotter
than
a
lunatic's
underarms
in
a
straitjacket
In
other
words,
we
get
it
cracking,
but
I
keep
it
cool,
you
know?
This
is
why
they
fuck
with
me
(haha)
This
is
why
they
fuck
with
me
(real
talk)
I'm
no
gangster,
no
killer,
I'm
just
your
average
Joe
(come
on)
But
one
thing
you
should
consider,
I'm
the
realest
you
know
So
there
you
have
it
But
I'mma
leave
you
with
this
An
O.G.
once
told
me
A
real
gangster
is
either
dead
or
in
jail
Or
behind
the
scenes
getting
real
money
I'm
gone
H.O.C.,
H.O.C
All
the
real
smokers
get
me
H.O.C
All
the
real
smokers
get
me
H.O.C
H.O.C.,
H.O.C
All
the
real
smokers
get
me
H.O.C
All
the
real
smokers
get
me
H.O.C
Everybody
know
I
spit
that
other
shit
Shit
that
make
you
duck
for
cover
shit
Shit
that
make
you
hop
out
your
seat
and
slap
your
mother
shit
Especially
when
Drop
drop
the
beat
I
drop
jewels
like
my
nuts
dropped
out
of
my
briefs
Jump
in
the
booth
and
shatter
every
rapper's
dream
They
jump
in
a
sauna
because
I
killed
their
self-esteem
That's
a
jab,
you
should
bob
and
weave
Like
Pam
when
Martin
pulled
jokes
out
his
sleeve
I
go
in
studio
sessions
and
feel
like
a
nerd
Cause
I'm
the
only
nigga
there
not
smoking
no
herb
You
telling
me
the
kush
make
you
think
on
level
four?
I'm
on
five,
you
saying
that
I
can
level
more?
In
high
school,
my
teachers
thought
I
was
smoking
stress
Didn't
know
my
eyes
low
cause
of
genetic
defects
I
stimulate
my
mind
every
time
I
think
about
the
end
of
time
Creation
of
man,
and
Columbine
Bet
you
think
that
this
some
high
shit
that

the

I

Look,
nowadays
everybody
think
they're
big
chiefers
Just
cause
they
heard
that
new
tape
from
Wiz
Khalifa
Knowing
damn
well
they
can't
hit
the
sour
They're
new
booties,
they
probably
need
baby
powder
My
skill
shower
over
your
city
for
40
days
40
nights,
off
the
chain,
like
freedom
of
slaves
Before
you
get
it
twisted,
like
40
gays
My
flow
worth
the
earth,
that's
not
to
be
appraised
Those
the
type
of
lines
that
I'm
talking
'bout
You
know
the
type
of
rhymes
you
don't
talk
about
Copy
my
session
on
a
disc
when
the
session
ends
So
my
momma
can
have
it
and
play
it
for
her
friends
Brag
on
me,
like
"My
son's
'bout
to
win
Somehow,
someday,
and
I
don't
care
when"
I
might
hit
the
gin
once
a
month
I'll
let
you
inhale,
like
an
atheist
Bet
you
think
that
this
some
high
shit

I

I'll
take
you
back
to
the
9th
grade
When
Dough
Boy
had
me
high
for
4
days
That's
my
nigga,
he
a
street
nigga
Probably
in
your
hood,
fucking
up
your
street,
nigga
But
anyway
I
think
it
was
some
purple
Told
me
"Don't
hit
it
hard
because
it'll
hurt
you"
I
didn't
listen,
I
was
floating
like
the
Rose
Parade
Swear
to
God
a
nigga
seen
some
flying
fishes
That
was
the
Vegas
trip,
Hooters
sponsored
The
same
time
I
start
writing
like
a
fucking
monster
I'm
Frankenstein
every
time
this
mothafucker
ponders
Just
underline
every
letter,
capital
K-D-O-T
Laying
it
flat
out,
like
a
tire
with
slow
leaks
Now
what
you
'bout?
Nothing
huh
Am
I
a
square
cause
I
don't
puff
a
square?
Are
my
raps
too
blunt
to
hit
the
blunt?
Yeah
Bet
you
think
that
this
some
high
shit
that
I

Probably

Ali,
you
thirsty
on
Twitter!
You
boo-boo,
you
T'd
You
turned
down,
you
thirsty
You
boo-boo!
Uh,
I'm
tryna
learn
something
new
I'm
tryna
find
myself,
I'm
searching
deep
for
Kendrick
Lamar
I
read
about
Napoleon
Hill
and
try
to
know
God
They
say
he
the
key
to
my
blessings,
and
if
I
speak
the
good
Into
existence,
that
instant
my
dreams
will
unlock
Money
flow
like
water,
I'll
just
wait
at
the
dock
And
by
the
way
I'ma
start,
finding
more
light
to
shed
Like
a
small
garage
in
your
backyard
I'm
back
chilling
with
a
friend
of
mine,
she
mighty
fine
But
I
notice
that
her
heart
resides
next
to
bitterness
Always
hollering
who
she
don't
like
and
who
she
kick
it
with
Who
she
wanna
fight,
who
wearing
a
weave
Who
Dooney
and
Bourke
bag
is
fake,
who
holding
the
keys
To
the
car
she
drove
last
year
or
who
fucking
on
who
And
who
need
a
pap
smear,
getting
on
my
nerves
But
before
your
negative
energy
curve,
bitch
I'ma
cut
you
off
'Cause
every
time
you
come
around
You
be
hollering
that
whoop-de-whoop,
blah-zay-blah
He
say,
she
say,
oh
my
God
Shut
the
fuck
up...
hoe
Every
time
you
come
around
You
be
hollering
that
whoop-de-whoop,
blah-zay-blah
He
say,
she
say...
Uh,
I'm
tryna
learn
something
new
I'm
tryna
surround
myself
with
people
that
inspire
me
Or
at
least
inquire
similar
desires
To
do
what
it
T-A-K-E
just
to
reach
the
T-O-P
I'm
talking
ideas,
motivation
It's
more
than
making,
enemies,
my
nigga
Oh,
that's
not
ya
memo?
Then
tell
me
why
you
constant
stressing
On
how
you
well
connected
like
centipedes,
my
nigga
I
function
with
you
and
you
flaunt
your
pistol
Every
second
tell
me
how
you
pressed
'em
at
the
Monte
Cristo
Where
so
and
so
from,
and
what
neighborhoods
beefing
Who
baby
momma's
a
rat,
and
who
got
killed
last
weekend
That
shit
is
mad
depressing,
bringing
me
down
Speak
on
somethin'
with
some
substance
that
can
get
us
both
paid
Rather
than
telling
me
how
these
niggas
jocking
your
style
Or
his
rims
ain't
bigger,
pussy
nigga,
I'ma
cut
you
off
'Cause
every
time
you
come
around
You

hollering
that
whoop-de-whoop,
blah-zay-blah
He
say,
she
say,
oh
my
God
Shut
the
fuck
up...
scary
ass
Every
time
you
come
around
You
be
hollering
that
whoop-de-whoop,
blah-zay-blah
He
say,
she
say
Uh,
I'm
tryna
learn
something
new
I'm
tryna
better
my
chances
of
becoming
a
star
I'm
tryna
feel
the
vibe
of
Mona
Lisa
Studying
art...
now
paint
that
picture
Life
behind
bars,
remember
the
very
day
I
got
caught?
I
murdered
a
rapper,
and
you
filed
the
police
report?
See
what
I
was
taught,
family
is
all
I
need
But
indeed
them
too
can
run
me
right
up
a
tree
Constantly
talking
shit
'bout
the
next
relative
Wanting
me
to
take
sides,
but
I'd
never
give
in
Ever
since
grandma
died,
everyone
parted
ways
Argue
on
holidays,
left
my
uncle
in
prison
For
15
years,
no
one
paid
him
attention
but
moms
Yeah,

momma

loyal
as
any
sister

come
Come

house

Dang,

through
my
veins
I

'Cause
everytime

Y'all

He

HiiiPoWeR
is
the
way
we
think,
the
way
we
live
See
it’s
known
today
that
the
human
race
is
nothing
No
morals,
no
standards
What
we’re
about
to
do
is
raise
the
level
of
expectations
No,
you
don’t
have
to
have
a
lot
of
money
You
don’t
have
to
be
rich
But
you
will
be
rich
in
mind
and
spirit
Some
say
it’s
as
big
as
a
crew,
some
say
it’s
as
big
as
a
gang
HiiiPoWeR,
we
stand
for
it
as
if
it’s

as

tedious
For

to
eat
TV
dinners
every
time
we
was
famished
But
it
was
such
a
pleasure
to
watch
you
try
to
hold
it
together
Every
time
I
put
the
head
in
you
would
panic
And
come
right
down
like
an
avalanche
Make
your
legs
slant,
whisper
till
you
juicing
up
your
pants
Baby

that
sound?
Kosher,
no
sir
Wake
it
back
up,
Folger's
holsters
By
my
waistline,
shot
for
your
heart
and
You
called
it
a
hate
crime,
say
you
want
me
back
And
your
girl
wanna
date
Dom,

high
school
shit
4-0-1
K,
we
could
be
friends
with
benefits,
you
dig
that?
That
girl
is
smoking
And
can
you
believe
that
I'm
her
focus?
It
ain't
hard
to
see
she
got
me
open
And
together,
we
are
roller-coasting,
on,
on,
on
I
upped
and
walked
out,
now
she
crying
'cause
She
need
me,
I
got
that
Jon
Brion
love
Had
to
find
love,
we
called
it
punch-drunk
We
was
a
two-piece,
she
was
a
one-punch
You
know,
a
knock-out,
and
if
she
was
to
walk
out
My
heart
would
go
black,
shrivel
up
and
drop
out
There
we
go
again,
what
the
fuck
you
talking
'bout?
We
used
to
fuck
all
the
time
back
at
my
momma's
house
Smoking
beedies,
laying
on
the
futon
Memories
I
got
saved
up
like
a
coupon
And
we'd
be
too
gone
off
a
sack
of
stress
weed
I
was
broke
then,
couldn't
cop
the
best
weed
Then
she
would
just
leave
in
a
black
hatchback
Homies
from
the
hood
used
to
ask
me
if
I'd
tapped
that
I
would
say
“Yep”,
smiling
so
freely
That
was
back
then,
but
I
bet
she
still
need
me
She
need
me,
she
need
me
She
need
me,
she
need
me
I
would
say
“Yes”,
smiling
so
freely
That
was
back
then,
I
bet
she
still
need
me
That
girl
is
smoking
And
can
you
believe
that
I'm
her
focus?
It
ain't
hard
to
see
she
got
me

And
together,
we
are
roller-coasting,
on,

Let

Wonder

Like

You

Sleeping

Starving

Bowl

21
gun

And
my

killed
20

And
I

about
nine

Jive

All

ghosts
every
time
I
wrote
a
crazy
line
All
these
12
bars
in
my
verses,
that's
what
Notorious
and
Pac
arrived
God

a
Mac

I

dimes,
you
pretending

No

Hand

Cloth

Gun

Bullet

Stick

Every

Over
the

drums
They
say,
"Who

MC?"
I

'em
none
Get

I
tell
'em
none
Catholic

Christian,
holding
the

In
the

of
my
True
Religions
Never
passed
the
bar
but
I
ain't
got
to
study
law
Just
to
judge
lyrics
Mmm,
I
should
be
the
judge
of
lyrics
Bang

sentence
I'm

All

Gettin'

Tryna

So

Cause

I've
been
broke
I'm
K-Dot

Aiming

GANG)
Owwww,

unorthodox
I
order
plenty
ammunition
for
the
enemies
that
I
got
I'm
the
King,
I'm
just
looking
for
my
Coretta
Scott
Bet
I
pop,
like
a
boy
band,
I'm
annoying
to
rappers
Guess
I'm
poison
to
rappers,
front
on
me,
get
bent
backwards
Stepping
on
em'
like
a
Kappa
Cap
and
gown,
graduated
with
my
Masters
So
where
do
I
go
now
Swear
there
is
none
after
I'm
the
bishop,
I'm
the

I'm
the
god
MC
And
you
don't
want
to
get
caught
in
the
rapture
I
would
probably
burn
your
whole
colony
Chew
you
up
then
spit
you
out
Your
nothing
but
a
Polla
Seed
Follow
hood
policies
Compton,
California
where
the
motherfuckin'
riders

You
never
seen
a
killer
til
you

That
green
on
the

of
me
Fuckin'
all
about
my
fuckin'
money
like
Assadomy
Fuck

bitches
properly
I
do
it
I
do
it,
done
it
run
it
like
I
grown
legs
by
the
hundreds
My
pocket
full
of
hundreds,
I'm
always
hungry
Been
hungry,
I
think
a
nigga
need
three
stomachs
Bummy,
NEVER
Middle
of
a
conversation,
I
cough
up
a
feather
And
get
ready
for
the
detonation
I
bomber
whoever
Whatever
you
bout,
I'm
bout
it
twice
like
a
woman
who
give
twins
life
I
steered
right
through
your
fan
base
every
time
Tapping
your
demographic
like
I
was
Gregory
Hines
Every
line
be
tailor
made,
hella
paid,
count
that
money,
several
ways
I'm
a
beast,
fuck
a
mansion,
I
rather
live
in
a
cave
Sasquatch

but
what
y'all
really
didn’t
know
is
I
sasquatch
can
rap
Motherfucker
I'm
iller
Ok,
I
squeeze
the
juice
out
a
rapper
and
just
squash
this
track
The
people
like
"What
the
fuck
happened
and
where
Wayne
be
at?"
There's
some
boy
named
K
Dot
and
he's
a
maniac!
I
think
his
vocals
is
strapped,
with
a
toolie
in
fact
He
spit
like
a
Uzi,
rat-tat-tat
He
just
shot
me
in
my
back,
somebody
pick
up
my
back
I
think
that
boy
from
Iraq
,
I
think
y'all
boys
better
know
that
He
got
it
on
lock
like
a
Low
Jack
Heading
straight
for
the
top
like
a
ball
cap
Y'all
better
fall
back,
y'all
better
crawl
back
where
ya'll
came
from
Ain't
one
better
than
the
one
who
can
write
like
Langston
Hughes
from
the
brain
off
top
Like
a
bottle
dude,
get
a
hollow,
where
you
swallow
food
Get

model,

scuba
diver
eyes

Recognize

On

When
I
go
pop
pop
Open

Everybody

Whoo
Ha!
Backpack

with
gats
in
it
Don't
get
your
cap
peeled
by
the
black
menace
K-Dot
thoroughbred
Move
like
a
militant
soldier,
on
point
like
a
pyramid
A
forced
to
be
reckoned
with,
fuck
with
the
best
shit
Like
the
strongest
manure,
I'm
ready
when
you
are
This
is
it,
I'm
in
the
lab
cooking
up
all
day
Fuck
'em
up
all
day
like
a
nympho
I
been
dope
since
S
curl
waves
Trying
to
convince
hoes
I
got
good
hair
Knowing
damn
well
there's
chemicals
there
I'm
in
the
hood
with
the
17
year-olds
that's
on
hood
patrol
And
they
want
stripes,
so
they
shoot
off
bikes
And
you
know
any
moment
you
can
lose
your
life
So
kiss
your
kids
and
hug
your
wife,
and
what
not
yo
I
spar
with
a
dragon,
he
tried
to
throw
a
flame
But
I
ducked,
then
I
stabbed
him
and
came
out
the
battle
laughin'
That's
a
metaphor
for
any
rapper
who
wants
it
I
smack
'em
til
their
nose
is
running
You
know
the
hoes
is
coming
if
I'm
there
And
the
hoes
is
cumming
once
we
hit
the
hotel
There's
no
assumptions
Cool
out
before
I
move
out,
hop
on
the
105
Do
about
105
before
your
ass
gets
threw
out
the
back
seat
(There's
a
dead
guy
on
the
freeway)
Oh,
It's
not
Dot?
Tell
the
medics
it's
okay
A
beast
when
the
beat
break
You
probably
think
I'm
dope
like
this
the
realest
shit
I
wrote
But
to
me,
it's
a
throw-away
I
stare
at
the
four
walls
and
rap
like
I'm
mad
at
God
Nice
enough
to
throw
a
spear
at
Nas
Launch
at
Jay,
matter
fact,
let
me
take
that
back
See
I
don't
fuck
with
real
legends
in
rap
like
you
do
I'm
crucial,
concealed
by
real
crips
and
suwoo
And
they
shoot
like
photography
students
when
beef
gets
to
brewing
Is
it
real
son?
Is
it
really
real

Is

Is
it

Tell

how
you

son.
Tell
me
how
you
feel
son
Tell
me
how
you
feel
son.
Tell
me
how
you
feel
You
rappers
got
nothing
for
me
when
Sound-Sounwave
record
me
Every
MC,
I'm
sure
to
rip
them,
I
guarantee
you
will
forgive
them
Come
again,
no
introduction,
you
know
my
name
Soul
brother,
Dueces
suck
the
juice
from
my
ding-a-ling
Orangutan
arms
banging
niggas
like
a
set
When
I
speak,
they
fucking
silent
like
sex
for
the
deaf
Violence,
I
play
it
like
violins
in
the
orchestra
Treat
you
like
vitamins
then
spit
you
back
out
Like
a
verse
I
had
way
back
before
I
had
it
mapped
out
Rip
a
page
out
the
Almanac
then
cross
reference
when
I
wreck
shit
I
wish
jaw
bone
fractures
on
all
of
you
rappers
bumping
your
gums
Like
the
measles
when
the
record
meets
the
needle
Heads
spinning
like
a
twelve-inch,
Smoking
the
best
Celtic
Like
I
shot
Larry
Bird,
follow
my
word
Big
Herb,
Ill
with
it,
I
need
a
hospital
gown
You
need
54
cards,
deal
with
it
You
may
think
I'm
killing
it,
but
I'm
healing
it
Like
a
bitch
in
the
club,
Shoe
game
Ay
yo
yo,
the
flow
potent
Who's
more
focused?
Kick
doors
open
Deliver
the
golden
opus
leave
with
two
guns
smoking
It's
me,
the
podium
closing,
a
poet
well-spoken
The
gropes
is
most
consistent
with
imminent
penmanship
Mind-bending,
co-existing
with
the
written
Verbal
assassin,
Internally
smashing,
Spazzing
on
tracks
Translation,
I'm
disgusting
in
action
A
lyrical
glutton
busting
over
Sounwave
productions
Y'all
don't
want
nothing,
The
sum
of
all
fears
Mercury
rising,
I'm
summer
all
year
I
sixteen
'em
to
death
and
wish
them
the
best
I
guess
that's
the
gift
and
a
curse,
You
see
my
pattering
Y'all
still
rapping
like
that's
what's
happening
I
write
rhymes
with
fire
on
stone
tablets
Peep
the
malice,
I'm
a
monster
Ya
Boy
running
like
William
Joseph
Crawford
Is
it
real
son?
Is
it
really
real
son?
Is
it
really

Is

Tell

Tell

Tell

You

Every

Straight
up,
Don't
get
ate
up
Put
rappers
in
quicksand,
Dot
leaned
on
'em
like
kickstands
I'm
so
hot,
kids
put
me
in
their
iPod
Even
atheists
play
my
shit
and
say,
"My
God,
Jesus,
Joseph,
and
Mary,
he's
nice"
Don't
compare
me
to
them,
just
compare
me
to
Mike
Jordan
When
I
record
and
the
verse
and
the
chorus
is
ill
You
can
land
in
lab
of
fortune
when
biting
my
skills,
playa'
Watch
I
lay-up
bar
after
bar
like
I'm
trying
to
build
a
gate

See
me
on
the
way
up
like
an
elevator,
I'mma
let
you
take
the
stares
That
metaphor
meaning
I'm
already
there
(Greatness)
I'm
in
the
booth
with
an
apron
Cooking
up
shit
like
Martha
Stewart
was
my
bitch,
Amen
Stay
on
the
curb
like
a
?
day
tan?
Blowing
herb
with
my
nigga
Herb,
Fuck
what
you
niggas
heard
We
the
new
West
Coast
Wu
Tang
bitch
and
I'm
the
best
Stay
blessed,
You
can
suck
my
dick
Who
from
the
West
can
kill
it
like
us?
Give
me
their
name
Now
I
take
'em
to
the
house
of
pain,
Top
Dawg
headquarters
Is
it
real
son?
Is
it
really
real
son?
Is
it
really
real
son?
Is
it
really
real?
Tell
me
how
you
feel
son.
Tell
me
how
you
feel
son
Tell
me
how
you
feel
son.
Tell
me
how
you
feel
You
rappers
got
nothing
for
me
when
Sound-Sounwave
record
me
Every
MC,
I'm
sure
to
rip
them,
I
guarantee
you
will
forgive
them
In
due
time
I'm
the
modern
day
Albert
Einstein
I'm
prime
time
like
Deion
And
the
rest
of
y'all
is
peons
I
pee
on
the
best
Whoever
you
are
you
can
step
Like
a
prosthetic
leg
I
see
monsters
in
my
head
That's
why
I
rap
with
such
aggression
I
tear
down
studio
sessions
Rappers
scared,
they
walk
in
the
booth
With
a
bible
and
a
reverend
I
use
my
mouth
as
a
weapon
Bullets
rip
through
your
mid
section
Rat

I'm
a
Comptown,
nigga
get
a
casket
Go
against
me,
that'll
lead
to
my
advantage
Because
I've
got
to
eat
And
for
real
I'm
feeling
kind
of
famished
Hotter
than
the
earth
core,
don't
show
me
where
no
fan
is
Show
me
where
your
fans
is
so
they
can
see
the
real
I'm
sick
and
electrifying,
that's
double
ill
Me
feel
like
me
will
be
a
legend
like
Will
was
a
legend
But
I'm
not
an
actor,
put
that
in
my
will
Gimme
a
second
uncut
coke
lyrics
what
I'm
stressing
She
want
the
raw
so
I
fed
her
lines
like
Kevin
Tell
'em
I'm
a
werewolf,
behold
the
5

bigfoot
Lear
jet
overlook
the
country
like
Garth
Brooks
Lyrics
on
point,
plus
I
got
the
right
hooks
Like
Tommy
Hearns,
punchlines
burn
I'm
not
concerned
about
the
SoundScan
Cause
most
of
y'all
is
drowning
A
lifeguard
that's
lounging
Meaning
I
don't
worry
about
none
of
you
rappers
I'm
way
more
live
That's
evil
backwards
Now
with
that
great
word
play
I
tend
to
let
my
words
play
Like
children
on
a
Saturday
It's
sad
to
say
you're
not
up
to
par
And
I
don't
play
with
mini
golf
and
sharks
Jump
inside
the
pool
of
sharks,
we're
biting
off
your
head,
your
heart,
your
legs,
arms
Bled
like
Jay
Rock
or
Big
Wy
And
make
sure
you
wear
a
vest
Because
they
my
family
ties
Suit
up
You
got
a
three
piece?
I
got
a
three
piece
A
MAC-11,
a
9
mili,
and
a
DE
He
backpedaling
like
a
DB
I'm
such
a
Martian
Call
me
ET
Always
behind
it
like
I
own
the
TP
I
shit,
fart,
pee
pee
On
anybody
track
Walk
in
the
booth
and
drink
down
a
fifth
of
Ex-Lax
Wassup
Now
phone
home
My
nigga
Punchline
is
on,
wipe
'em
down
Your
boy
carry
that
flame
I
am
a
arsonist
I
spit
arsenic
at
you
niggas
cartilage
Ill
wip,

by,
niggas
carsick
20
on
the
charm
VVS
studded
flawless
Try
and
reach
we
specialize
in
garbage
Taking
out
the
trash
put
you
underneath
the
tar
pits
How
many
times
I
gotta
tell
y'all
niggas
the
big
fish
in
the
small
pond
I
wail
on
niggas
I'm
vicious
No,
I'm
serious
Skip
the
birth
canal
and
climb
straight
Cesarean
You
niggas
ain't
listening
I'm
not
from
'round
these
parts
I'm
nonexistent
Hit
you
with
brake
light
Leave
you
missing
Yeah,
see
I
know
I
can
make
a
lot
of
money
doing
this
man
It's
just
the
whole
process
that
uh...
That
I'm
having
trouble
with
know
what
I
mean
I
know
you
just
pretty
much,
you
know
Get
the
water
boiling
and
just
uh
get
a
jar
or
something
like
that
Put
it
in
the
jar
and
just
watch
it
you
know
bubble
up
and
all
that
Shame
on
him!
(what?)
Lemme
put
my
gloves
on
And
my
scrubs
on
I'm
the
chemist
that's
whippin'
it
in
the
kitchen
This
here
is
not
for
the
children
You
need
parental
advision
If
you
wanna
learn
how
to
cook
in
the
dope
business
First
you
bargain
shop
Look
for
the
priciest
chickens
I
recommend
that
you
pay
Jorge
a
visit
Got
it
wrapped
in
saran
17.5
no
Drop
four
grand
This
is
LA
man
Unless
it
be
a
drought
But
homie
if
it
ain't
Then
it
is
somewhere
else
Flip
your
hustle
down
south
That's
a
whole
other
story
though
Back
to
the
lesson
Hope
you're
takin'
down
your
footnotes
Class
is
in
session
Get
your
instruments
Grab
some
baking
soda,
a
triple
beam,
a
beaker
And
a
hanger
you
can
stir
it
with
Split
nine
Os
four
ways
in
that
36
Place
it
on
the
triple
beam
As
hard
as
it
may
seem,
it's
not
that
tricky
Say
you'll
get
it
baby
just
bear
with
me
Confidence
before
compliments
Now
let's
get
busy
This
is
the
procedure
250
grams
of
coke,
150
grams
of
soda
Place
it
in
the
beaker
Your
water
should
be
boiling
by
then
Grab
a
small
cup
and
pour
it
in
Twist
the
hanger
until
it's
paper
thin
Place
the
hanger
in
the
beaker
then
give
your
wrist
a
circular
spin
But
hold
on
it
gets
tricky
again!
As
your
hand
rotate
You're
probably
thinkin'
it's
safe
Until
it
starts
to
harden,
slowing
down
the
pace
The
muscle
inside
your
arm
is
makin'
your
joints
ache
You're
strugglin'
on
the
job,
but
don't
lose
faith
Wait...you
got
it
back
soft
(good)
Now
pour
some
hot
water
inside
the
beaker
jar
The
work
should
rise
to
the
top
Then
pour
some
cold
water
on
that
That's
when
the
dope
should
drop
Snatch
the
cookie
out
the
jar,
grab
a
razor
from
the
cabinet
Place
it
on
the
cardboard,
then
chop
As
soon
as
the
razor
hit
the
work,
you're
happy
You're
excited
that
the
chemistry
worked
This
the
fiend's
appetite
This
bigger
than
life
You
turned
to
Mr.
Nino
Brown
in
one
night
You
should
thank
me
twice
Though
you
learned
from
a
chemist
who
never
moved
a
brick
in
his
life
How
ironic...hmm
Like
most
of
you
rappers
Aw
I
don't
believe
that
man
You're
too
professional
with
it
man
There's
no
way
you've
never
done
it
before,
know
what
I
mean
That
was
too
descriptive
K.Dot
TDE
I'm
starin'
at
you
and
you
look
so
good
I
want
it
in
the
back
seat
and
on
top
of
the
hood
And,
I
would
do
it
all
day
if
I
could
Put
a
lumberjack
on
and
give
you
the
wood
You
gotta
man
and
that's
understood
But
I
gotta
girlfriend
too,
this
a
mutual
move
So
we
do
what
grown
folk
do
She
had
a
new
lit
candle
on
the
table
for
two
A
home
cooked
meal
with
the
best
soul
food
I
told
her
"get
on
my
plate,
I'll
just
have
you"
You
can
sit
on
my
face
after
I
say
grace
Or
I
could
just
beat
it
up
like
I
knew
kung
fu
We
ended
up
in
the
kitchen
with
a
sink
full
of
dishes
Then
I
sat
her
on
the
stove
like
a
pot
when
I
hit
it
She
never
want
me
to
stop
when
I'm
in
it
Not
even
a
minute
until
she
finish
Then
I
don't
She
works
at
the
corner
store
She
is
so
bad,
so
bad,
so...
I
said
"my
name
is
Soul
Store
me
inside
you
phone
We
need
some
time
alone
In
our
near
future,
future
Cause
I
am
tryin'
to
bone
Whenever
your
man
ain't
home
Take
off
your
pants,
baby
And
come
to
me
We
done
had
all
this
drank
We
done
smoked
all
this
weed
Take
off
your
pants
Dont
be
scared
of
me
I
won't
hurt
you
girl
I'll
be
your
therapy
When
I
come
from
out
of
that
pussy
And
I
smell
fresh
air
You
lost
your
voice
yelling
"Pull
my
long
ass
hair!"
Had
the
112
Clan
We
could
do
it
anywhere
I
ask
her
where
she
want
it
next
She
started
staring
at
the
stairs
So
we
did
it
on
the
stairs
And
we
took
it
upstairs
Then
we
came
back
down
When
she
came
and
she
gave
me
The
crown
that
I
wear,
right
now
Then
I
bounce
like
rubber
Just
in
case
her
man
come
unannounced
Send
me
a
text
message
saying
it
was
the
bomb
I
send
her
a
text
like
"hit
me
when
he
gone
So
we
can
continue
to
creep."
And
now
I'm
in
the
sheets
3
days
out
the
week
Freaks
come
out
at
night
But
I'm
up
in
the
morning
And
she
up
in
the
morning
So
we
gon'
fuck
in
the
morning
My
only
problem
is
running
out
of
condoms
She
say
she
on
the
patch,
but
I
can't
buy
that
Knock
on
the
door
He
isn't
home
Shes
all
alone
Her
legs
so
long
Don't
ask
me
whats
wrong
Ask
me
whats
right
Cuz
I
just
wanna
lay
pipe
for
your
info
She

tricks
on
the
dick
this
is
how
I
know
She
make
my
whole
shit
disappear
down
her
throat
And
this
a
trip,
she
don't
even
choke
And
I
beat
like
a
heart,
she
can
feel
a
pulse
Beat,
beat,
beat,
beat....
C4,
K.Dot,
let's
get
it
Yeah,
Punch
wanted
me
to
come
right
in
on
the
one
I
didn't
want
to
I
love
this
beat
I
love
it
so
much,
I
can
just
listen
to
the
instrumental
And
don't
rap
But
I
won't
do
that
Light
an
incense
for
little
Kendrick
Little
oh
Kendrick
Determination,
my
drive
is
like
a
thousand
convertible
engines
My
adrenaline
pump
the
blood
of
a
warrior,
chump,
the
apprentice
Grown
to
be
a
man,
21
now,
my
heart
in
my
hand
Don’t
get
gunned
down,
I’m
from
Compton
bitch
Fuck

6-4,

hit
the
kill
switch
The
other
day
I
seen
my
nigga
Snows
in
the
casket
Darker
skin
tone,
you
can
only
imagine
The
type
of
shit
we
on,
murdered
them
dumb
bastards
Kill
em
inside
their
kitchen
and
then
stuffed
them
inside
their
cabinets
Death
before
dishonor,
put
that
on
my
Mama
I'mma
ride
till
I
see
the
promise
land,
that’s
a
promise
Llamas
in
the
unfamiliar
minivan,
more
drama
only
make
more
problems
but
They
gotta
get
shot
down,
cause
we
riding,

riding,
they
gotta
get

black
rodeo,
44’s,
calicos
Chop

We

praying
on
ya
I
gotta
feed

and
your
death

nutritious
to
my
appetite
After
I

you’re
sure
to
see
afterlife
Jesus
Christ,
forgive
me
for
my
sins,
because
when
you
forgive
me,
I’m
sure
to
sin
again
I
guess
I’m
a
sinner,
especially
when
I
found
out
somebody
killed
my
nigga
Nigga

Son

Being

Still

Danny
Glovers

Alien
tactics
The
god

they're

As
I

like
Santa

Pause

in
the
Phantom
Bitches
on
my
left
and
my
right
like
I

Dancing

emerging
from
the
smoke
Pimping
in
my

to
check
my
pulse
They
knew
that
was
K.Dot
the
gemini,
with
another
cut
like
a
Samurai
Anything
else
is
uncivilized
Fucker
Yeah.
How

Ali?
Good?
Then

Can
I

past
a

Centennial
Compton
School
District
And
video
campus
shut
the
fuck
up
your
premises
King
Drew
and
Westchester
had
the
baddest
bitches
And
my
nigga
L
Wood
had
a
white
Toyota,
and
we
got
pulled
over
Had
to
hide
the
bottle
because
there
was
mix
with
Hennessy
and
soda
Every
time
we
rode
up
we
was
unsober
And
everybody
had
know
that
My
nigga
Yan
Yan
had
all
the
red
P
Hat
Which
was
really
dumb
because
where
we
was
at
Was
the
other
side
and
more
than
likely
The
other
side
really
didn't
like
that
Didn't
have
no
burner
so
if
they
shot
us
we
could
never
really
shoot
back
Could
of
lost
our
life
over
hood
rats
We
was
dumb
as
fuck
but
lucky
for
us
we
was
lucky
enough
That
the
black
car
didn't
pull
up
and
ask
where
yall
niggas
from
I
know
some,
nigga
less
fortunate
was
fucking
with
the
enemies'
bitch
She
had
a
fat
ass
and
a
brown
Camaro
but
it
wasn't
that
fast
it
was
like
a
V6
But
anyways
she
was
one
of
those
hoes
in
highschool
with
the
cornrows
Size
5
Jordans,
Rolex
sporting,
and
wanna
fight
everybody
she
knows
Well
she's
important,
well
she
wasn't,
she
was
just
so
and
so
so
and
so
cousin
He
was
a
red,
so
anytime
she
got
into
it,
that
who
she
would
get
Now
let
me
get
back
to
the
plan
Homie
had
ask,
"
Do
ya
got
a
man?"
She
said,"No",
he
said,
"Oh
yeah
Where
do
you
stay?"
She
said,
"
Rosecrans"
Rosecrans
and
what?
She
said,
"Don't
matter
just
know
I
fuck
He
said,
"What?
you're
a,
you're
a
little
freaky
bitch
huh?"
She
said,
"Yeah
daddy
I
can
you
get
you
sprung
I
can
work
that
pussy
and
the
tongue
If
you
come
over
I
can
make
you
cum
If
you
come
over
make
sure
that
you
bring
drink
Because
I
like
to
get
to
drunk."
And
that
he
did,
that
Friday
he
was
where
she
lived
Notice
that
he
was
out
of
bounds
But
didn't
give
a
fuck
cause
he
wanted
to
fuck
that
bitch
right
now
Walked
in
the
house,
rubber
on,
panties
down
Oldies
playing
in
the
background
Let's
get
it
on
Marvin
Gaye
had
bumped
to
the
morning
Time
to
go,
picked
his
pants
up
off
the
floor
Kissed
that
bitch
in
the
mouth
then
walked
to
the
door
When
he
walked

Bluh!
Didn't

guess

all
can
learn
from
mistakes
But
your
first
mistake,
might
be
your
death
date
And
death
doesn't
wait,
on
no
one
A
million
ways
to
die,
and
you
can
make
it
a
million
and
one
If
you
not
aware
of
the
rules
or
maybe
tryna
fill
someone
else
shoes
Like
a

He

When
he
went
to
first
get
put

the
hood
He

Boys
in
the
Hood
the
movie
made
him
think

But
usually

type
of
person

self
on
purpose
Tell

worthless
His
momma

money,
his
daddy
had
money,
so
he
had
money
The
OG's
that
gave
him

think
that
he
was
gonna
be
just
another
crash
dummy
And
the
funny
thing
about
it
he
thought

was

P-Miller
But
he
wasn't

Just

gorillas
Everybody

guy
so
he
did,
approached
this
guy
like,
"Where
are
you
from?"
with
his
gun
but
didn't
shoot
it,
rule
number
one
Never
pull
out
if
you
don't
use
it
Even
though
the
dude
didn't
banged
the
very
next
day
he
seen
around
the
way
blew
his
brains
out
while
homeboy
was
cruising
Not

scariest
nigga

And

Waking

Baby
you
understand
me
now
If
sometimes
you
see
that
I'm
mad
Don't
you
know
no
one
alive
can
always
be
an
angel
When
everything
goes
wrong,
you
see
some
bad
But
I'm
just
a
soul
whose
intentions
are
good
Oh
lord
please
don't
let
me
be
misunderstood
As
soon
as
the
beat
drop
Within
two
bars,
you
already
said
I'm
hot
They
savor,
my
fruits
of
labor
My
flow
is
sweeter
than
strawberries,
oranges,
and
apricots
God-dammit
I
raised
the
standards
of
the
status-quo
To
go
against
me
you
gotta
be
more
than
professional
You
got
to
go
extra
hard
like
an
erection
with
no
protection
And
I
be
fucking
all
these
bars
We
be
sexing
I'm
a
nympho
For
the
instrumentals,
all
right,
I
admit
it
Matter
of
fact
I
got
a
hot
date
tonight,
real
rap
Take
this
and
take
that
from
the
machine
Got
this
money
up,
with
no
caffeine
Prepare
me
is
Kerosene
struck
by
a
bunch
of
lightening
You
looking
at
me
then
your
sight
seeing
And
what
that
means
is
that
this
human
being
is
fly,
don't
try
to
duplicate
I'm
authentic,
I
see
you
scoping
my
style
like
forensics,
that
is
foul
Tech!
Leave
'em
by
the
benches
I'm
just
a
soul
whose
intentions
are
good
Oh
lord
please
don't
let
me
be
misunderstood
I
see
the
future
better
than
your
computers
Apple
software
got
the
next
10
years
scared
I'm
Fred
Krueger
Rugers
on
my
hip,
terminate
all
intruders
Leave
them
dead
inside
the
sewers
Shoulda'
coulda'
knew
I
was
a
murderer
Burning
up
the
very
sun,
the
rapture
The
god
is
back,
they
said
he'd
come,
but
I
came
faster
I'm
not
an
actor,
if
you
play
Denzel,
you'll
be
thrown
through
a
windshield
The
nine
merely
is
handheld,
the
AK
is
hands
on
Now
the
battlefield
I
can
land
on
one
thousand
mines
and
don't
blow
up
because
I'm
the
bomb
Inside
your
CD
deck,
duck
for
cover,
guard
your
neck,
I
demand
respect
If
I
never
see
a
check,
at
least
I
got
these
rap
niggas
in
check
Preach
Tabernacle
fetch
the
holy
bible
if
I'm
lying
King
of
my
jungle,
swear
to
remain
humble,
keep
my
vision
tunnel
Because
I
don't
need
to
get
sidetracked,
my
producer
name
is
Soundwave
and
he
gives
me
beats
by
the
batch
I'm
just
a
soul
whose
intentions
are
good
Oh
lord
please
don't
let
me
be
misunderstood
My
flow
cold,
like
Aspen
I
love
to
show
off
when
I'm
in
that
Aston
Look
I
act
a
ass,
but
I'm
not
jack
A
east
side
nigga
I
can
get
you
popped
at
A
hundred
rounds
nigga
stop
that
You
can't
make
that
ass
sit
or
flip-flop
back
I'm
too
gutta
nigga
top
that
This
is
lyrical
homicide,
not
rap
So
don't
get
it
misunderstood
Say
my
name
on
your
bars,
shit
I'm
in
your
hood
With
45
goons
45
shugs
Chase
your
ass
upstairs
throw
you
of
your
roof
I
see
you
big
dogs,
all
I
hear
is
woof
Loud
talk,
no
bite,
you
niggas
is
puss
I'm
off
that
bubble
kush,
thinking
about
life
Or
how
to
make
a
mill
and
spend
it
all
in
one
night
I
just
might...
...Snatch
your
bitch
if
she
got
a
great
appetite
For
the
top
dog
catalog,
that
means
everybody
Several
bodies
on
the
shoty
don't
make
it
eight
rappers
Damn
I
hate
rappers,
don't
call
me
that
If
you
called
it
how
you
seen
it
you
would
call
me
real
rap
I
don't
fabricate
shit,
all
I
do
is
keep
it
real
Eat,
sleep,
and
take
shits
wipe
me
down
if
you
will
Hold
up,
big
truck,
lurkin'
with
the
monster
grill
Four
fifteens
I
got
beat
like
Emmett
Till
Put
me
in
my
g-mode
schooling
every
hot-head
Tell
them
about
the
g-code,
like
eskimos
My
arms
froze,
popsicle
Observing
the
game,
I'm
so
official
Soundwave,
I
feel
we,
put
together
Some
of
the
most
beautiful
music
my
nigga
Real
talk,
feels
so
good
Let's
get
this
money
I
feel
like
rapping
tonight
people
Can
I
rap
a
little?
Don't
be
mad..
Cuz
I'm
young
and
I'm
black
and
my
hat's
real
low
If
you
don't
like
my
lyrics
you
can
press
fast
forward
Look,
why
I
always
feel
that
I'm
hot?
Why
I
always
feel
I
should
drop
another
jewel
Like
Martin
on
Blue
Streak
while
you
dudes
get
tattooed
With
permanent
scars,
I'm
always
bullying
y'all
I'm
always
righteous
to
think
that
life
is
what
you
make
it
I'm
always
thinking
of
R&B
bitches
butt-naked
I'm
always
on
point,
like
a
snitch
on
the
go
But
I
never
snitch
my
car's
the
only
thing
I
towed
on
I'm
always
keeping
it
moving,
middle
finger
up
Like
I
practice
celibacy,
I
don't
give
a
fuck
Just
wait,
I'm
at
they
heads
like
a
toupee
yeah
It's
like
that,
your
cranium
never
survive
titanium
bars
Harder
than
my
dick
when
the
tip
gets
licked,
quick
Run
for
cover
like
winter's
here
then
listen
here
K.
Dot
you'll
never
shake
me
loose
Like
a
tied
knot
off
the
goose,
you
mad
at
me
too?
Cause
I'm
young
and
I'm
black
and
my
hat's
real
low
(I
can't
front)
If
you
don't
like
my
lyrics
you
can
press
fast
forward
I
can't
front,
I
can't
front
sometimes
I
feel
like..
Yo,
why
you
always
critiquing
my
shit
Why
don't
you
hop
on
your
own
dick
like
Marilyn
Manson
I'm
dancing
with
2
brains,
so
if
I
got
shot
in
the
head
I
won't
die
I'll
just
lose
more
game,
propane
walking
You
could
sell
my
words
at
an
auction
for
the
right
price
And
be
rich
your
whole
life,
straight
up
I
wanna
see
the
world
by
35
but
for
right
now
I'm
Compton
bound
Hit
Rosecrans
with
a
pocket
full
of
dividends
Big
truck
speed
through
the
light,
run
over
civilians
Pimp
cut
bitch
on
my
right,
hat
low
like
a
stripper
ass
When
she
hit
the
floor,
doing
my
thing,
why
you
complain?
Cause
I'm
young
and
I'm
black
and
I
rap
like
a
nigga
got
a
Angel
on
his
back,
wait
a
minute
I
means
business
You
homosexual
with
it,
I
give
you
straight
lyrics
Now
that's
an
emcee,
that's
why
you
mad
at
me?
Cause
I'm
young
and
I'm
black
and
my
hat's
real
low
If
you
don't
like
my
lyrics
you
can
press
fast
forward
(Fuck
Ya!)
Check
me
out..
What
I
write
is
a
like
a
bomb
device,
press
play
And
you
can
die
tonight
Shook
ones
don't
exist
whenever
that
K.
Dot
spit
Off
the
chain
like
fast
pedaling
while
riding
a
bike
I
gets
my
ride
on,
you
ride
too
But
like
Scion,
now
that's
a
damn
shame
I'm
hogging
up
both
lanes
Play
your
part,
styles
like
Kevin
Hart
They're
so
plain
I'm
choking
while
I'm
smoking
on
this
strongest
hocus
pocus
Chocking
with
Punch
He
sarcastic
laughing
cause
I
said
that
I
can
freestyle
better
than
Kurupt
Now
that's
a
statement
that
hopefully
I
can
back
up
See
Kurupt
is
a
legend,
that's
where
I
get
my
shit
from
Straight
lab
rat,
spit
it
once
run
it
back
Like
a
punt
return,
they
tell
me
wait
my
turn
So
that's
what
I'mma
do,
lay
in
the
cut
like
a
2
shot
Dillinger
Killing
these
niggas
in
high
pursuit
waddup
Ladies
and
Gentlemen
We're
gonna
ask
you
for
some
fanfare...the
band
fanfare
because...ladies
and
gentlemen...sting
has
always
gone
ahead
of
itself
They
have
done
it
again
and
again
and
again
I
remember
the
year
they
brought
in
the
fat
boys
they
were
hotter
then
ten
thousand
fire
sides
And
if
you
know...and
if
you
enjoy
hip-hop...if
you
want
one
of
the
coldest
brothaz
out
of
North
America...a
brotha
that
gave
you
a
song
like
Juicy...
You
hear
a
crew
in
Jamaica
with
something
that
goes
like
this
"Who
the
heck
is
this
Paging
me
in
the
morning
At
the
crack
of
dawning"
Please
welcome...for
the
first
time...in
Sting
96...Please
welcome
(welcome...welcome)
The
Notorious....the
Notorious...B.I.G...AKA
bigge!
It
has
been
said,
that
there
has
been
known
to
be
bloodshed
Over
bread,
men
who
have
bled
to
death,
dead
Strapped
to
beds,
pipe
bombs,
dynamite,
lead
Money,
power,
respect,
street
cred,
yeah
It's
scary
ain't
it?
Picture
yourself
going
out
as
a
hero
Picture
mural
pictures
of
us
painted
all
over
street
corners
Fans
meet
to
mourn
us,
while
we
meet
the
coroners
Notorious
tried
to
warn
us
We
watched,
so
many
piggybacked
off
of
Biggie's
back
and
'Pac's,
landmarks,
history
in
rap
Statistically
in
fact;
it's
so
sad
to
see
us
re-enact
These
tragic
events,
which
lead
us
back
To
where
we
left
off
on
March
9th
To
come
from
such
hard
knock
lives
And
make
it
up
out
of
'em,
hit
the
spotlights
And,
once
they're
on
us
this
is
our
lives
Thrust
out
for
all
eyes
to
cast
upon
us
To
see
who
can
last
the
longest
And
he
who
lasts
the
longest,
must
be
the
strongest
In
this
concrete
jungle,
where
this
dog
eat
dog
mentality
comes
from
It's
origin,
which
is
usually
originated
from
cats
who
starving
Or
it
could
just
be
somebody's
horror,
that
just
horri-fies
And
applies
to
his
persona
or
the
sizes
In
his
entou-rage,
that
intimidates
the
people
To
the
point
that
you
know
that
he's
gangster
He
ain't
just
say
shit,
you
just
believe
it
Since
B.I.G.
taught
us
niggas
to
think
big
I'm
been
about
my
business
since
then,
so
anxious
It
ain't
how
we
live,
it's
what
he
said,
he
did
it
for
Brooklyn
This
I
took
in,
sent
chills
through
my
skin
Vicious,
I'm
experiencing
the
same
sights
as
him
It's
what
excited
Obie
to
write
these
poems
Rolling,
going
through
the
same
shit
he
spoken
Open
up
my
eyes
so
there's
no
limit
in
them
skies
When
Ready
to
Die
was
a
sick
part
of
my
life
Palming
that
forty-five,
plotting
to
pop
my
mind
Then
that
crooked
eye
Jamaican
I'd
so
many
times
rewind
Got
me
to
walk
a
straight
line
and
get
up
on
my
grind
Get
up
out
the
system,
who
could
give
him
better
signs
No
pop
of
mine
could
top
Big
Poppa
rhymes
So
possibly
I'd
be
popular,
huh?
That's
the
inspiration
I
got
from
my
nigga
B.I
I
took
him
from
coal
to
diamond,
I
molded
his
mind
Enter
the
most
phenomenal
artist
of
any
and
all
time
I
made
a
Frankenstein,
my
design
impressed
Backpackers
and
press
who
said
my
house
was
a
mess
Critics
lashed,
said
I
made
a
fortune
off
of
his
passing
All
I
did
was
build
a
dynasty,
off
of
his
passion
And
I'm
addressing
the
adolescents
absent
to
who
he
is
The
original
king
of
New
York,
Christopher
Wallace
This
is
a
promise
on
Diddy's
honor,
I'm
a
father
T'Yanna
And
teach
her
that
with
all
the
drama
don't
even
bother
On
repeat,
all
of
your
albums
play
back
to
back
And
I
visit
your
grave
cause
our
friendship's
intact
An
immaculate
concept,
extravagant
progress
Bullet
wounds
left
in
my
heart,
I'm
yelling
"God
bless"
Regardless
to
critics
yelling
that
East/West
I
seen
the
game
losing,
I'm
just
pressing
the
reset
And
when
the
resurrection
of
you
shines
through
an
individual

Nigga
I
don't
sweat
the
date,
my
moms
is
late
So
I
had
to
plan
my
escape,
out
the
skins
In
this
world,
the
fly
girl
Tanqueray
or
Hennessy
until
I
called
Earl
Ten
months
in
this
gut,
what
the
fuck
I
wish
moms
would
hurry
up
so
I
could
get
buck
While,
Juvenile
rippin'
mics
and
shit
New
York,
New
York
ready
for
the
likes
of
this
Uh,
then
came
the
worst
date,
May,
21st
2:19
is
when
my
mama's
water
burst
No
spouse
in
the
house,
so
she
rolls
herself
To
the
hospital,
to
see
if
she
could
get
a
little
help
Umbilical
chord's
wraped
around
my
neck
I'm
seein'
my
death,
and
I
ain't
even
took
my
first
step
I
made
it
out,
I'm
bringin'
mad
joy
The
doctor
looked
and
said
"He's
gonna
be
a
Bad
Boy."
I
remmember
back
in
time
(1970
somethin',
1970
somethin')
Before
all
the
homies
died
Before
all
the
dollars
and
nines
I
knew
that
I
was
goin'
somewhere
Let
me
take
you
back
in
time
(19,
70
somethin',
1970
somethin')
Before
I
even
got
the
rhyme,
before
I
had
nickels
and
Dimes,
I
knew
that
I
was
goin'
somewhere
Would
'Pac
be
alive,
if
you
let
'Pac
drive?
Swear
to
God,
to
reverse,
that
I'll
give
my
Left
Eye
With
the
right
I'll
visualize
the
king
of
Bed-Stuy
Checkin'
his
daughter,
Tyanna
into
junior
high
If
I
was
in
Brooklyn
and
B.I.
was
still
alive
In
2006,
it
might
sound
like
this
NY,
7-1-8's,
2-1-2's
With
Sue's
rendezvous,
it's
like
Moulin
Rouge
High
fashion,
uptown
Air
Force
Ones
and
Vasquez
Puerto
Ricans
with
fat
asses
Blazed
dutch
masters,

dump
ashes
On
models
in
S
classes

Catch

that
Broadway
actin'
You
hype,

Belly
shit'll
get
you
capped
and
wrapped
in
plastic
Tell
the
captain
to
ask
Rog'
What's
Happenin'?
I
hear,
nor
speak
no
evil
inside
the
magnum
(1970
somethin',
1970
somethin')
I
remmember
back
in
time
Before
all
the
homies
died
Before
all
the
dollars
and
nines
I
knew
that
I
was
goin'
somewhere
(19,
70
somethin',
1970
somethin')
Let
me
take
you
back
in
time
Now
I'm
thirteen,
smokin'
blunts
makin'
cream
On
the
drug
scene,
fuck
a
football
team
Riskin'
ruptured

by
the
age
of

Hearin'

scream
ain't
my
lifetime
dream
I
mean,
I
wanna
blow
up,
stack
my
dough
up
So
school,
I
didn't
show
up,
it
fucked
my
flow
up
Mom
said
that
I
should
grow
up,
and
check
myself
Before
I
wreck
myself,
disrespect

Scarface,

New

I
wanna

Rap
was
secondary,

was
necessary
Until

C-74,
Mark
8
set
me
straight
Not
able
to
move
behind
a
great
steel
gate
Time
to
contemplate,
damn,
where
did
I
fail?
All
the
money
I
stacked,
was
all
the
money
for
bail
I
remmember
back
in
time
(1970
somethin',
1970
somethin')
Before
all
the
homies
died
Before
all
the
dollars
and
nines
I
knew
that
I
was
goin'
somewhere
Let
me
take
you
back
in
time
(1970
somethin',
1970
somethin')
Before
I
even
got
the
rhyme,
before
I
had
nickels
and
Dimes,
I
knew
that
I
was
goin'
somewhere
And
I
knew
that
I
was
going
somewhere
Ooooh,
oooooh

somethin',

Welcome
to
the
House
of
Pain
Just
Blaze,
niggas
There's
no
way
out,
it
seems
I
can't
get
free
Somebody
tell
me
what's
happened
to
me
The
country
bud
got
me
chokin'
I'm
on
a
mission
to
the
point
that
motherfuckers
think
I'm
smokin'
Yeah,
that
sick
nigga
Biggie
with
the
8-shot
fifth
With
the
extra
clip
for
that
extra
shit
Don't
you
know
that
a
killing
is
thrilling?
All
the
blood
spilling
is
all
a
part
of
drug
dealing
A
born
gangsta,
my
daddy
was
a
thug
Had
a
.38
with
the
hollow
point
slug
So
when
he
licked
shots
Niggas
dropped
quicker
than
a
bootlegger
sells
his
liquor
A
little
nigga
tried
to
squeeze
.22's
in
my
Reebok
shoes
Payin'
dues,
while
kids
was
on
their
one's
and
two's
Now
I'm
much
older,
colder,
fuck
a
holster
Got
the
MAC-11
swingin'
from
my
shoulder
It's
a
damn
shame
I
got
to
put
my
momma
through
the
strain
I'm
livin'
in
a
house
of
pain
Is
anybody
listenin'?
Tell
me
can
you
can
see
This
darkness
surrounding
me
Now
it's
gettin'
colder
heavy
on
my
shoulder
And
it's
gettin'
hard
to
breathe
Vision's
gettin'
blurry,
I'm
gettin'
worried
'Cause
it's
gettin'
hard
to
see
When
you're
livin'
in
the
House
of
Pain
The
motherfuckin'
dust
kicker,
who
can
you
trust?
Do
you
have
the
heart
to
see
a
nigga,
before
you
bust?
My
name
is
spoken
on
the
tongues
of
so
many
foes
Bustin'
motherfuckers
out
the
box,
I
ain't
even
go!
Now
how
the
hell
do
you
explain
my
claim
to
fame?
From
doin'
flicks
to
bustin'
tricks
out
the
fuckin'
frame
Got
these
bitches
on
my
jock,
niggas
on
my
block
Jealous
ass
suckers
got
'em
duckin'
from
my
smokin'
Glock
And
bustin'
niggas
asses
to
stay
alive
Skinny
ass
player
watchin'
bigger
motherfuckers
fry
They
ask
me
how
I'm
livin',
high,
I'm
a
hustler
Buckin'
busters
'til
they
die
Now

on
in
the
ghetto,

Niggas

they
AK's
headin'

Aimin'

Vision's

(Be

'Cause
it's
gettin'

(Yeah,

When

(What

Wendy
Williams

And

Fresh

Man

Damn

it
Flipped
two
keys
in
two
weeks

My
brain
is
haunted,
with
mean
dreams
GS's

supreme
schemes,
to

Richer
Than

Got

so
I
won't

Them

Frank
White
I'm
squirtin

my
loft
of

I
know
my
shit's
tight
Sunrise
open
my
eyes
no
surprise
Got
my
shorty
flying
in
with
keys
taped
to
her
thighs
With
all
the
utensils,
who
hang
my
china
thing
She
half
black
half
oriental
eighty-six
she
got
me
rentals
I
used
to
drive
a
Chevy
Monte
Carlo,
bricks
of
blow
all
in
it
I
was
taught
to
sell
the
shit,
you
put
your
nose
all
in
it
Let
my
bitch
drive
the
Benz
but
the
Rolls
off
limits
How
you
call
yourself
pimpin,
with
hoes
all
in
your
buisness
What
it
is,
the
music
business
or
the
streets
make
a
decision
I
do
this
in
my
sleep,
and
you
way
out
your
division
pimp
This
game
we
play
for
keeps,
and
the
rules
remain
hidden
This
ain't
a
place
for
lames
and
that
snitching
shit
is
forbidden
After
sitting
in
the
kitchen
and
whipping
with
hopes
of
getting
back
All
that
off
a
brick
to
go
blow
it,
so
it
even
50
stacks
And
now
I'm
sitting
back,
thinking
about
a
time
When
a
nigga
get
a
100
g's,
think
he
went
down
But
now
look
for
loyalty
in
the
game,
it
ain't
there
And
things
ain't
the
same
they
changed
it
ain't
fair
Real
niggas
dead,
doing
their
time
and
ain't
here
You
commit
the
same
crime
and
come
home
the
same
year
Uh

Come

It

Back

Now
Biggie
Smalls

not
the
type
to
fall
in
love
with
'em
Hit
'em
and
forget
'em
and
go
handle
my
business
I
like
the
kind
of
whine
and
dine,
who
grindin'
all
the
time
Yo
ex
girl
was
a
fly,
but
now
lucked
up
on
a
dime,
nigga
What
is
it
with
you,
all
you
wanna
do
is
lay
around
And
stay
around
and
get
mad
when
I
play
around
I
like
to
lay
never
work,
put
your
money
in
my
purse
To
the
mall,
I
go
search
matchin'
shoes
for
my
skirt
Tuesday
I
saw
you
on

zee,
but

Wednesday

what
your

Me
and
my
friends
got
your
Benz,
attractin'
mens
And
spendin'
dividends,
blowin'
like
the
wind
So
I
guess
you
think
I'm
slippin'
cause
I
ain't
flippin'
Baby,
I'm
Big
Poppa,

trippin'
I
ain't
trippin'
nor

I'm
just
liquor
sippin'
At
the
bar,
tippin'
wit
your
money,
can
you
pay
the
difference?
It
seems
like
it's
a
waste
of
time,
that's
why
I
wrote
the
rhyme
I
hear
you
jump
in
every
car,
except
for
mines
Nigga,
I
don't
jump
in
cars,
I'm
a
superstar
Face
way
to
flaw,
you
should
hang
me
on
your
wall
All
I
do
all
day
is
drink
Tanqueray
Thinking
of
a
way
to
put
a
smile
on
your
face
Make
me
smile,
see
them
teeth,
me
look
cute
down
to
them
features
My
waste,
my
physique,
me
don't
want
freak-a-leek
Should
I
wine
and
dine?
You
put
ring
on
your
fingers
While
sex
from
the
next
man
in
the
bedroom
lingers
Sex
will
never
linger,
hold
up,
put
up
the
blinkers
I
flow
just
like
sprinklers,
give
yo

middle

I

I

Throw
the

threaten
to
pull

And
squeeze,
until
the

completely

I'm
glad
I'm

My

She

I

Forgive

Let's
say
there
are
many
times
I
looked
And
saw
reflections
of
my
son
I
argued
sometimes,
consulted;
I
saw
results,
and
said
"Well
done."
I
thought
of
him
constantly
And
silently
asked
"Why?"
I
tried
fervently
And
just
cannot
say
goodbye
I
lived
with
visions
twined
and
twisted
Passion
so
cold
And
withered
thoughts,
battered
and
shattered
I
dreamed
dreams
Cherished
memories
Housed
friendship
And
promises
that
mattered
In
the
end

is
treasured;
But
love
for
my

It's

Took

Now

Another

Hoes,

Smooth

Pendegrass,

The
Brooklyn-born
Teflon
Don,

Getting

nobody
drops
Words

blunt
smoking
Bed-Stuy
bandit
And

Jujitsu,

Like

Hope

I

Fat

Not

What

My

Burn

I

Your

Slugger
B.G.-zy

Slanging,

Haters,

By

And
my
bitch

to
God
she
won't
snitch
I
told
her:
"When
she
hit
the
bricks
I'll
make
the

Conspiracy

She'll

about

As
a
child
Christopher
was
outspoken
When
it
suited
him
at
times
he
was
quiet
And
of
course
he
was
mischievous
as
all
little
boys
are
As
a
young
man
he
liked
to
do
everything
He
liked
to
read,
he
liked
to
be
with
his
friends
As
young
kids
or
young
boys
he
enjoyed
life
Everything
that
would
make
him
happy
or
comfortable
He
would
do
but
mostly
he
enjoyed
being
with
his
friends
and
family
His
early
inspirations
toward
rap
music
were
The
LL's
of
the
world,
the
Sugar
Hills,
the
Mr.
Magics
And
the
Fat
Boys
of
the
rap
channel
Those
were
all
the
things
I
heard
in
the
house
Even
though
I
called
it
noise
and
banging
I
know
now,
it
is
a
accepted
musical
art
form
I
was
a
single
parent,
I
raised
my
son
on
my
own
His
father
had
no
influence
on
his
decision
Towards
the
musical
outlet
or
career
he
chose
My
son
had
a
mind
of
his
own,
even
if
his
father
was
around
He
would
have
turned
to
rap
he
loved
music,
he
loved
rap
At
a
point
in
my
son's
life
he
developed
paranoia
About
death
and
about
the
dying
We
are
living
in
a
world
of
imperfect
human
beings
Where
greed,
jealousy
and
envy
Are
manifested
by
what
others
have
accomplished
in
life
My
son
was
very
very
much
aware
of
that
He
appreciated
his
station
in
life
on
the
directions
In
which
he
was
going
or
traveling
On
the
other
hand
there
were
others
Who
I
should
use
the
hip
hop
phrase
player
hating
And
I
think
that
is
what
resulted
in
his
paranoia
If
I
had
to
change
anything
in
my
son's
life
That
would
have
allowed
him
to
be
here
today
I
would
have
deterred
him
from
a
career
in
music
I'm
aware
that
millions
appreciate
his
music,
millions
loved
his
music
Be
that
it
may
if
he
hadn't
chosen
that
lifestyle,
that
career
My
son
would
be
alive
today
If
I
could
sum
up
Christopher
in
one
word
the
word
would
be
generous
The
thing
that
my
son
loved
most
about
life
was
the
fact
that
He
was
in
a
position
to
help,
position
to
share
Position
to
give
to
others
who
needed,
to
others
who
wanted
To
others
appreciated
the
gifts
that
he
gave

Ah,

The

Salt

how
to

Snoop
(oops!)
I'm

by
a

-

I
gets

Stop

My
nigga
Sing,

the
16th
floor
Check

I
look
deeper;
I
see
blood
up
on
his
sneakers
And
his
fist
gripped
a
chrome
four-fifth
So
I

Beacon

Retaliation

And
they
took
drugs,
they
tried
to
jerk
us
We
blazed
they
place;
long
story,
Glo'
seen't
my
face
Got
shook,
thought
a
nigga
was
coming
for
the
safe
(Haha!)
Now
she
breaking,
"Shut
up!
112,
what's
shaking?"
"A
Jamaican,
some
bitches,
I
swear
they
look
gay
And
a
black
Range
Rover
been
outside
all
day"
If
it's
trouble,
let
me
know,
I'll
be
on
my
way
"Please,
I
got
kids
to
feed,
I
done
seen
you
make
niggas
bleed"
Nightmare,
this
bitch
don't
need
"Ron,

the
gasoline,
this
spot,
we

to
blow
this
Get
the
cash
before
the
cops
and
Range
Rover
cats
notice"
Room
112,
right
by
the
staircase,
perfect
place
When
they
evacuate,
they
meet
they
fate
"Ron,
pass
the
gasoline,"
the
nigga
passed
me
kerosene
(Ugh)
Fuck
it,
it's
flame-able,
my
hunger
is
unexplainable
Strike
the
match,
just
what
I
expected
The
dread
kid
ejected
in
seconds,
and
here
come
two...
Opposite
sexes,
one
black,
one
Malaysian
We
in
the
hallway,
waiting
patient
As
soon
as
she
hit
the
door,
we
start
blasting
I
saw
her
brains
hit
the
floor,
Ron
laughing,
I
swear
to
God
I
hit
Maxi
Priest
at
least
twelve
times
in
the
chest
Spinned
around,
shot
the
chink
in
the
breast
(Ugh)
She
crying,
headshots
put
her
to
rest
Pop
open
them
briefcases,
nothing
but
Franklin
faces
The
spot's
hot:
sprinklers,
alarm
systems
That's
when
other
guests
start
to
slip
in
It's
time
for
us
to
get
to
dipping
I
know
them
niggas
in
the
Range
is
on
they
way
up
Flipping,
pistol-gripping,
I
load
the
clip
in
The
hallway
got
real
loud
and
crowded
They
walked
right
past
us,
I
don't
know
how
they
allowed
it
The
funny
thing
about
it,
through
all
the
excitement
(Uh-huh)
They
Range
got
towed,
they
double-parked
by
a
hydrant
Stupid
motherfuckers

Sweetness,

Petiteness,

The

Try

Yo,

With

conniving
stunt
Y'all

Find

Then

get
laced
Televisions,
Versace

I'm

The

the
shit's
legit
She

dick
from
a
player
off
the
New
York
Knicks
Nigga
tricked
ridiculous,
the
shit
was
plush
She's
stressing
me
to
fuck,
like
she
was
in
a
rush
We
fucked
in
his
bed,
quite
dangerous
I'm
in
his
ass
while
he
playing
'gainst
the
Utah
Jazz
My
112,
CD
blast,
I
was
past
She
came
twice,
I
came
last,
roll
the
grass
She
giggle,
saying
"I'm
smoking
on
home-grown"
Then
I
heard
the
moan,
"Honey,
I'm
home!"
Yep,
tote
chrome
for
situations
like
this
I'm
up
in
his
broad,
I
know
he
won't
like
this
Now
I'm
like,
"Bitch,

talk
to
him
Before
this
fifth
put
a
spark
to
him
Fuck

shit
get
dark
to
him,
put
a
part
through
him
Lose
a
major
part
to
him—arm,
leg..."
She
beggin'
me
to
stop
but
this
cat
gettin'
closer
Gettin'
hot
like
a
toaster,
I
cocks
the
toast,
ugh
Before
my
eyes
could
blink
She
screams
out,
"Honey,
bring
me
up
somethin'
to
drink!"
He
go
back
downstairs,
more
time
to
think
Her
brain
racing,
she's
telling
me
to
stay
patient
She
don't
know
I'm
cool
as
a
fan
Gat
in
hand,
I
don't
wanna
blast

But
I
can

I
will,
though;
I'm
tryna
chill

Even
though
situation
looking
kinda
ill,

It
came
to
me
like
a
song
I
wrote
Told
the
bitch,
"Gimme
your
scarf,
pillowcase,
and
rope"
Got
dressed
quick,
tied
the
scarf
around
my
face
Roped
the
bitch
up,
gagged
her
mouth
with
the
pillowcase
Play

nigga
coming

some
Love
Potion

Flash
the
heat
on

he

emotionless
Dropped
the
glass
screaming,
"Don't

the
stash!
A
hundred
cash!
Just

Nigga

Put

Grab

Triple

Put

Pick

To

Going

Word

You

Each

Daydreams

See

sellin'
three
bricks
of
straight
flour
Got
my
man
a
beat
down
to
the
third
power
He
didn't
care,
spent
the
money
in
a
half
hour
Got
some
fishscale,
reigned
on
competition
like
a
shower
Got
the
coke
cooked
up,
a
crackhead
Kevin
In
'88,
when
Kane
ruled
with
"Half
Steppin'"
A
.38,
a
lot
of
mouth
was
our
only
weapon
We
was
kings
'til
the
D's
crept
in
And
now
I'm
missin'
him
Ooh,
I'm
missin'
you
(I'm
missin'
you)
Tell
me
why
the
road
turns,
why
it
turns
Ooh,

missin'
you
(missin'
you)
Nah

Oh

Uhh,

the

We
rocked
flat
tops,
our
girls
rocked
doobies
Made
a
killin',
even
though
the
D's
knew
me
Eventually,
you
know
they
try
to
do
me
Fuck

Fed
up,
my
nigga
wanted
to
take
it
down
South
Sick
of
cops
coming,
sick
of
throwing
jacks
in
his
mouth
Gave
him
half
my
paper,
told
'em
"Go
that
route!"
Few
months,
he
got
his
brain
blown
out,
now
I'm
stressed
His
baby's
mother,
she
trippin',
blamin'
me
And
his
older
brothers
understand
the
game
it
be
Kinda
topsy
turvy;
you
win
some,
you
lose
some
Damn,

lost
a
brother,

mother
lost
a
son
Fuck,

I

for
three
days
I
cried
I,
look
in
the
sky
and
ask
God
why
Can't
look
his
baby
girls
in
the
eye
Damn,

missin'
him
Ooh,

Tell

She'd

groceries
My

sister,

girl
was
kinda
close
to
me
A
little
closer
than
the
average
girl's
supposed
to
be
Far
from
a
lover,
my
girl
was
jealous
of
her
Then

some
major

Handled

Bricklayers
A

Found

Squeezed

Don't

silence
and
violence?
Take

and
business
completely
separated
Money

waiting
to
start
hittin'
Number
10:
a
strong
word
called
"consignment"
Strictly
for
live
men,
not
for

they
money

And
I

But
you'll

It

only
yesterday
I
was
holding
you
in
my
arms
Now
look
at
you
now
big,
but
I
worry
about
you
I
worry
about
you
all
the
time,
hangin'
out
on
the
corner
All
times
at
night
with
the
cruel
people
Baby,
that
ain't
nothin'
but
trouble
I
always
taught
you
that
you
could
have
whatever
you
dream
Well,
I
want
you
to
hold
on
to
that
dream,
baby
Hold

it
real
tight,
‘cause
the

Good
evening,
ladies
and
gentlemen
How's
everybody
doing
tonight?
I'd
like
to
welcome
to
the
stage
The
lyrically
acclaimed
I
like
this
young
man,
because
when
he
came
out
He
came
out
with
the
phrase
He
went
from
ashy
to
classy
–
I
like
that
So
everybody
in
the
house
Give
a
warm
round
of
applause
for
The
Notorious
B.I.G
The
Notorious

Ladies
and

give
it
up
for
him
y'all!
Uh,
a
nigga
never
been
as
broke
as
me,
I
like
that
When
I
was
young,
I
had
two
pair
of
Lees,
besides
that
The
pin
stripes
and
the
gray
The
one
I
wore
on
Mondays
and
Wednesdays
While
niggas
flirt,
I'm
sewing
tigers
on
my
shirts,
and
alligators
You
want
to
see
the
inside?
I
see
you
later
Here
comes
the
drama,
oh
That's
that
nigga
with
the
fake,
blaow
Why
you
punch
me
in
my
face?
Stay
in
your
place
Play
your
position,
here
come
my
intuition
Go
in
this
nigga
pocket,
rob
him
while
his
friends
watchin'
And
hoes
clockin',
here
comes
respect
His
crew's
your
crew
or
they
might
be
next
Look
at
their
man
eye,
big
man,

never
try
So
we
rolled
with
them,
stole
with
them
I
mean
loyalty,
niggas
bought
me
milks
at

The

follow
me

For

Slugs

Little

Back

Look

A

With

Talkin'

But

Christopher
Williams
Still
some
MC's

I

To

big-and-heavy
I
get
up
in
that
ass

Says

Says
me,
the
lyrical
Niggas
sayin',
"Biggie
off
the
street,
it's
a
miracle!"
Left
the
drugs
alone,
took
the
thugs
along
with
me
Just
for
niggas
actin'
shifty
Sticks
and
stones
break
bones,
but
the
gat'll
kill
ya
quicker
Especially
when
I'm
drunk
off
the
liquor
Smokin'
funk
by
the
boxes,
packin'
Glocks-es
It's
natural
to
eat
you
niggas
like
chocolates
The

All

bitches,
big-booty
bitches
Used
to
sell
crack
so
I
could
stack
my
riches
Now
I
pack
gats
to
stop
all
the
snitches
From
stayin'
in
my
business,
what
is
this?
Relentless
approach
to
know
if
I'm
broke
or
not
Just
'cause
I
joke
and
smoke
a
lot
Don't
mean
I
don't
tote
the
Glock
Sixteen
shots

pen
Until

Come

the
Ave,
I'm
real
hard
to
find

'Cause
I'm
knee-deep
in
the
beats
In
the
Land
Cruiser
Jeep
with
the
MAC-10
by
the
seats
For
the
jackers,
the
jealous-ass
crackers
in
the
(blue
suits)
I'll
make
you
prove
that
it's
bulletproof
Hold
your
head
'cause
when
you
hit
the
bricks
I
got
gin,
mad
blunts,
and
bitches

The

So
I
guess
you
know
the
story,
the
rap-side,
crack-side
How
I
smoke
funk,
smack
bitches
on
the
backside
Bed-Stuy,
the
place
where
my
head
rests
Fifty-shot

The

High

That's

Beatin'

Tina
"What's

When
I'm
rippin'

Strapped

Bamboo

I

I

Niggas

Makin'

It's

and
plain,
to
maintain
I
add
a
little
funk
to
the
brain
The

When

You
actin'
like

can't
call
me
no
more
'cause

and
all
of
that
But

trying
to
tell
me
it
wasn't
good?
*Beep*
That
shit
is
real
fucked
up
what
you
did
I
hooked
you
up
with
my
girl
and
shit
You
fucked
her
every
time
you
see
her
You
don't
even
say
shit
to
her,
you
know
what
I'm
saying?
And
all
that
bitch
do
is
call
me
all
day
talking
about
you
"Why
the
fuck
B.I.G.
don't
want
me?"
*Beep*
Yo,

is
Quita
Kenya

me
she
saw
you
and
Shanie

You

That's

*Beep*
Yeah,

I
was
waiting
outside

your

like
a
fucking
hour
I
don't
know
what's
going
on,
motherfuckers
trying
to
rob
me
You

disappearing

What
the
fuck
is
going
on?
When
you
get
in
give
me
a
fucking
call,

When
it
comes
to
sex,
I'm
similar
to
the
Thrilla
in
Manila
Honeys
call
me
"Bigga
the
Condom
Filler"
Whether
it's
stiff

or
stiff

Biggie
squeeze

to
make
shit
fit,

Mess

A

All

is
separate
the
game
from
the
truth
Big

Bronx
to
Bolivia
Getting
physical
like
Olivia
Newt
Tricks

So

Even

She

Fuck

The

Used

'Cause

Peep

Really,

So

Maryland
With
my
man
Two-TECs
to

They
call
him
Two-TECs,
he
tote
two

And
when
he
start
to
bust,
he
like
to
ask,
"Who's
next?"
I
got
my
honey
on
the

with
the
crack
In
the

two
pounds
of
hash
in
the

I
wait
for
hon
to
make
some
quick

I
told

See

smoked,
what
rumors
was
spread
Last
I
heard
I
was

with

the
head
Then
I
got
the
phone
call,
it
couldn't
hit
me
harder
We
got
infiltrated,
like

in
a

I
never
heard

By
some

named
Alberta
over
nickel-plated
burners
And
my
bitch
swear
to
God
she
won't
snitch
I
told
her
when
she
hit
the
bricks
I'll
make
the
hooker
rich
Conspiracy,
she'll
be
home

pulled
up,
police
was
on
the
scene
Had
to
make
the
U-turn,
make
sure
my
shit
was
clean
Drove
down
the
block,
stashed
the
burner
in
the
bushes
Stepped
to
police
with
the
shoves
and
the
pushes
It
didn't
take
long
before
the
tears
start
I
saw
my
bitch
dead
with
the
gunshot
to
the
heart
And
I
know
it
was
meant
for
me
I
guess
the
niggas
felt
they
had
to
kill
the
closest
one
to
me
And
when
I
find
'em
your
life
is
to
an
end
They
killed
my
best
friend,

My

Girbauds
Bitches

Yeah

It

The

Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh
shit,

them
lips
and
them
hips
on
that
bitch
Dee

dip,
so
I
can
drop
my
mackadocious
shit
Light
the
blunt
clip
and
recognize
a
pimp
Needless
to
speak,
the
G's
obsolete
Don't
sleep,
banged
the
skins
in
a
week
On
the
creep
up
the
avenue
I
seen
her
on
the
block,
who
she
rapping
to?
That's
my
nigga
Dee,
damn
he
got
G
Now

You

a
friend
of
mine,
uh
Now
I
play
her
far
like
a
moon
play
a
star
She
still
sweat
me
hard
'cause
I'm
a
rap
star
I
be
cruising
up
the
block,
I
be
passing
her
Pimping
hard
with
a
female
passenger
And
the
only
time
I
call
her
to
hang
Is
when
me
and
Dee
blunted
up,
pissy,
scheming
on
a
gangbang
She
should
have
used
her
intuition
Then
she
wouldn't
be
classified
in
that
position,
listen
She's
saying
I
dissed
her
'cause
I'm
fucking
her
sister
A
message
to
the
fellas,
that
really
gets
'em
pissed,
uh
But
she
started
that
fucking
family
She
fucked
my
man
Dee,
so
why
she
mad
at
me?
(True)
Plus
your
sister
look
better
than
you
Give
head
better
than
you,
pussy
get
wetter
than
you
So
break
the
fuck
out
like
a
rash
I'm
glad
I
ain't
spend
no
cash

Dressed

No

(Ah)
Crime

I

She

Suckin'

chest
just
to
stop
my
fuckin'

I
wonder;

I
died,
would
tears
come
to
her
eyes?
Forgive
me
for
my
disrespect,
forgive
me
for
my

(You're

My

I

God
I

Throw

And

Internal

Sometimes

Run

You

Blazer,

Shit,

But

Drink

Live

And

To

Like

whole
O.G.B.

Most

Sent

Yo

You

Hey

Shit,

I

s'posed
to

no
feelings
for
these
hoes
out
here
man,
but
This
bitch
on
the
back
of
my
mind
man
(word?)
Yeah
man...
done
wrote
a
rhyme
'bout
the
bitch
man
(Let
me
hear
it)
Want
me
to
drop
the
drama
kid?
(Yeah)
Yeah,
dedicatin
this
to
you
man
Cause
my
man
50
Grand
told
me
straight
up
and
down
man
I
ain't
'sposed
to
love
NO
ho
Knahmsayin?
I
tried
to
tell
her
50
I
got
three
rules
in
life
I'm
not
to
be
played
with,
played
on
or
played
out
I'mma
drop
it
like
this
Lyin'
in
my
bed,
I'm
lookin'
at
four
walls
Echo
in
my
head
sayin'
I
got
a
lot
of
gall
Grippin'
my
cap,
my
pen
in
my
teeth
Thinkin'
what
this
ho
said,
she
called
me
a
thief
She
said
I
stole
her
heart,
and
didn't
leave
a
trace
I
told
her
I
was
sorry,
and
she
said
"get
out
my
face"
Walked
out
my
door
with
my
Walkman
in
my
pocket
Playin
"Love
Is
a
House,"
and
thinkin
how
she
jocked
it
When
she
had
the
key,
to
open
up
my
door
Adore,
that
Prince
scan
that
bought
me
on
the
floor
I
know
that
she
loved
me,
I
couldn't
ever
fake
it
I
say
go
buy
a
pie,
the
girl
would
go
bake
it
Makin'
a
record
was
important
to
me
More
important
than
her
that's
what
made
her
flee,
see
The
mistake
was
not
payin'
no
mind
All
her
posse
said
we
was
"two
of
a
kind"
I
call
her
back
twice,
your
sister
said
you're
broke
She
said
"when
you
left,
your
ears
was
full
of
smoke
Chokin'
on
a
cigarette,
you
don't
even
smoke!"
Jumped
in
the
train
station
put
in
a
token
Coulda
been
my
partner,
amigo,
my
peer
Just
waitin'
for
them
three
words
that
all
girls
wanna
hear
"I
love
you,"
huh,
you
would
start
to
cry,
if
I
would
reply
with
I.L.Y
Then
I
tell
your
friends
that
you
played
me
out
Said
I
wouldn't
say
"I
love
you"
just
to
make
you
shout
So
I,
call
up
7
digits
that
would
pick
up
your
phone
Your
sister
picked
it
up
and
said
that
you
wasn't
home
I
heard
you
in
the
back
cryin'
up
a
storm
Screamin'
how
you
wish
that
I
never
was
born
"I
hate
him!
I
hate
him!"
That's
what
she
kept
sayin
She'll
come
to
her
senses
is
what
I
kept
prayin'
But
now
I'm
gonna
lay
the
cards
on
the
line
Just
say
that
you
hate
me,
or
say
that
you're
mine
I
said,
when
I
played
ball
you
was
in
the
stands
When
I
was
sick,
you
held
my
hand
It
was
hard
to
say
before,
but
now
I
can
Bitch,
I
love
no
ho,
fuck

Tryna

Bum

Come

"B.I.G.

dissin'"
Feel
like

kissin'

feel
chapped
I

you
"it's

Now

What's
the
riff?
Who
I'm
sleepin
with?
I
ain't

To

gift
to
hoes,
I'm
tryin
to
take
bankroll
I
ain't
fuckin
nobody,
case
closed
You
hit
the
lights
and
decide
to
doze
off
No
kiss
goodnight,
didn't
take
your
clothes
off
And
my
dick
is
harder
than
a
rock
Nobody

cockblock
but

a
hardrock
The
fuck

think
I
am,
gay?
I
ain't
got
no
time
to
play
I
ain't
got
nothin'
to
say
Bounce
out
the
crib,
just
to
see
my
man
50
And
what's
up
with
B.I.G
And
the
O.G.B.,
you
know
they
keep
plenty
hookers
And

bad
looker
So

I
like
yeah,
oooh
Shit

Trust

want
is
bankroll
That's
what
I'm
tryin
to
tell
you

My
man
50

schooled

Can't

the
B.I.G
